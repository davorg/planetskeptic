Instead, Bridle and Nayler are attempting something more interesting: a counter-reading of western science that finds there has been space for ecosystemic thinking and more-than-human community all along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it all began&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Groundbreaking new research looks set to overturn our understanding of the origins of life on Earth, as &lt;strong&gt;Peter Forbes &lt;/strong&gt;writes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Since the discovery of DNA, inquiries into the origin of life have tended to focus on how DNA replication and the genetic code originated. How could complex life have begun to develop without such a code? We may now be opening a new chapter in biology that turns our assumptions upside down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The evolution of ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The Huxley family was linked with the atheist movement. But as &lt;strong&gt;Alison Bashford &lt;/strong&gt;discovered, there relationship to religion was more complicated than it might seem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Julian and Aldous both returned to Blake, time and again, trying to capture transcendence, through him, for themselves. And Aldous, we know, actively sought ways to experience this state, through words, through meditation, and finally through his death-bed injection of mescaline, which his wife called &amp;ldquo;a sacrament&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&amp;amp;A &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;J.P. O'Malley speaks with Adam Rutherford about the dark history and troubling present of eugenics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;...incidence of Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome has effectively dropped to zero in those countries. That does indeed begin to look like a eugenics project. It really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether we call it eugenics or not. The real impact is that there is a group of people who exist today, who, through advances in technology and reproductive medicine, may not continue to exist in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The winter 2022 issue of New Humanist is on sale now! &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt; for as little as &amp;pound;10 a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in this issue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/G6CXEF.jpg" height="980" alt="Prince Charles with the Queen" width="1000"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The accession of Charles III is a historic opportunity to modernise the monarchy and make a break from the Church, argues &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Copson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minoli Salgado &lt;/strong&gt;was in Colombo for protests that rocked the country.

    <title>Purple gold</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6036/purple-gold#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The interior of the Alhambra in Granada, 2016" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/La_Alhambra_Interior_Details__189358281_small.jpeg" height="1219" alt="The interior of the Alhambra" width="1719"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold is desirable for three simple reasons. It is scarce, inert and yellow. Other metals just can&amp;rsquo;t compete: copper turns green when it oxidises, silver tarnishes as it reacts with sulfurous compounds. Platinum is more promising, but you&amp;rsquo;d need to be a trained metallurgist or jeweller to pick it out from a line-up of other base metals. Only gold survives the ravages of chemistry and history, all the while being easily recognisable. Well, most of the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Alhambra in Granada is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous and well-preserved examples of Islamic architecture. Its magnificent ceilings were originally gilded with gold, but over the years these deteriorated. In the 19th century, to save on the expense of renovation, the glorious gilding was simply covered with gypsum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, in 1993, Dr Carolina Cardell from the University of Granada spotted purple patches forming on the ceiling. It is only in recent years, however, that the university acquired the tools and techniques to investigate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr Cardell and her team knew that whilst pure gold may well be inert, when mixed with other metals to make alloys some chemical reactions can occur. The conditions in the Alhambra made this chemistry possible; the gilding used is actually a leaf of tin coated with a gold/silver alloy. Meanwhile, the salt-rich spray from the nearby sea added chlorides to the mix. These conditions set up electrochemical reactions which dissolved some of the gold within the moist gypsum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using electron microscopic techniques, Dr Cardell spotted signs of this gold embedded within the gypsum. But how does this explain the purple patches? Well, gold nanoparticles are not actually yellow. Instead, they take on a red to purple colour, depending on their size. In fact, you have almost certainly come across this phenomena in recent years. This is because gold nanoparticles are also responsible for the purple smears and lines on the Covid lateral flow tests that we are all too familiar with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, all that is gold does not glitter. Sometimes, it turns purple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from our New Humanist winter edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Identity crisis in Northern Ireland?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6039/identity-crisis-in-northern-ireland#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Belfast_City_Hall_and_Big_Wheel!.jpg" height="1062" alt="Belfast City Hall and Big Wheel" width="1600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the first time in the history of Northern Ireland, Catholics outnumber Protestants. That is to say, inhabitants who are either Catholic or from a Catholic background (an important distinction) now make up 45.7 per cent of the population, as opposed to their Protestant counterparts, who now make up 43.48 per cent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a more complex picture than it seems, given that religious faith is also on the decline in the country. Still, the results from the 2021 census, which were published in September, are still bound to ruffle some feathers. Since the country was split into north and south in May 1921, the six counties in Ulster were intended to have a permanent Protestant majority. But higher birth rates among the Catholic community have gradually closed the gap. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The erosion of the Protestant majority, and the blurring of religious and community divides, has provided the backdrop for more talk of a future border poll and the renewed prospect of a united Ireland. Under the Good Friday agreement, a secretary of state must call a referendum if it seems likely that a majority would vote for the region to leave the UK &amp;ndash; although the wording is vague on how this would be ascertained. The Irish government, led by Sinn F&amp;eacute;in, has pushed for clarity on the circumstances in which a border poll might be called. Sinn F&amp;eacute;in, traditionally associated with the Catholic community, is now also the largest party in Northern Ireland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But perhaps the most significant long-term change in the population in Northern Ireland is the rise of people of no religion, which stands at 17.4 per cent, according to the census. It should no longer be presumed that religious and sectarian identity are the most important factors for the majority. Pearse Doherty of Sinn F&amp;eacute;in said there had to be plans for the future and noted that Brexit was a decisive issue. &amp;ldquo;More and more people want to be back in Europe, more and more people in terms of opinion polls are showing a desire for constitutional change,&amp;rdquo; he said. The head of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), Doug Beattie, said that talk of a border poll was an &amp;ldquo;unhelpful and ill-timed&amp;rdquo; distraction from other problems, like the cost of living crisis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The future of Northern Ireland is likely to rest with a new generation who defy easy categorisation &amp;ndash; in terms of politics as well as religious beliefs. Young people today are more keen on Irish unity than older generations, and are also more likely to identify as non-religious. If the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK is to survive, it will have to be firmly founded on secular ideals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from our New Humanist winter edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Untying the knot</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6038/untying-the-knot#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="From 'The Divorce' by Jean-Baptiste Lesueur" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/YP0111704-001_The-divorcelandscape.jpg" height="274" alt="From the painting 'The Divorce' by Jean-Baptiste Lesueur" width="410"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The introduction of no-fault divorces in England and Wales in April was a much-needed step forwards in our marriage law. Previously, partners who wanted to split had to prove they had lived apart for two years. Otherwise, they had to prove a &amp;ldquo;fault&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; based on adultery, bad behaviour or desertion &amp;ndash; dragging couples through the courts in cases that could be distressing, for partners as well as their children. You might assume that everyone would celebrate this end to unnecessary suffering in relationships that have run their course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But not everyone is happy with the change. According to the Ministry of Justice, there were more than 33,500 applications for divorce from April to June &amp;ndash; up 22 per cent on last year (and that&amp;rsquo;s only the ones that were able to be processed, given the sudden spike in demand). This rise has led some Christian voices to declare that the new legislation presents an existential threat to the institution of marriage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin Hart, director of the charity the Christian Institute, has described the new law as a &amp;ldquo;marriage-wrecker&amp;rsquo;s charter&amp;rdquo;. He said: &amp;ldquo;We are already seeing a deeply worrying shift in young people&amp;rsquo;s attitudes, away from Christian marriage and lifelong commitment to your husband or wife. Forty-two per cent of marriages already end in divorce but the Government is carrying on as if it wants it to be 100 per cent.&amp;rdquo; Hart is also the chairman of the campaign &amp;ldquo;Coalition for Marriage&amp;rdquo;, an umbrella group of organisations set up in 2012 to support &amp;ldquo;traditional marriage&amp;rdquo; and oppose reform, including gay marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, the Church of England itself has its origins in the breaking of marriage contracts: the desire of Henry VIII to produce an heir, and his turning against poor Catherine of Aragon. But many Christians believe the institution to be a sacred union protected by God. And as England and Wales free themselves of outdated marriage law, the Christian right in the United States is making noises about moving in the opposite direction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No-fault divorce has long been the norm in the US. Their first no-fault law was passed during the sexual revolution of 1969 in California, and other states followed &amp;ndash; the last, surprisingly, being New York in 2010. Now, following on from their &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; on abortion law, the Christian right may be looking at divorce as a future issue. An August report by the watchdog Media Matters collected statements from several right-wing figures who were critical of no-fault divorce. &amp;ldquo;Some of the loudest anti-LGBTQ conservative voices are also the biggest critics of no-fault divorce, in both cases making an appeal to tradition and what they see as a God-given natural order,&amp;rdquo; the report says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Couples that wish to split should be able to do so, without influence from the Christian church, or any other religion. Let&amp;rsquo;s celebrate our progress in England and Wales, while bearing in mind that these rights must always be protected and defended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from our New Humanist winter edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Reconstruction by John Gurche for the Human Origins Program." src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Homo_Neanderthalensis_Adult_Male_Reconstruction.jpeg" height="1064" alt="Homo neanderthalensis adult male, reconstruction." width="1596"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Svante P&amp;auml;&amp;auml;bo, a Swedish evolutionary biologist who sequenced the first Neanderthal genome in 2010. He spearheaded a new field known as paleogenomics, renewing debates about interbreeding between our earliest ancestors and their Neanderthal neighbours. We now know, for instance, that European and Asian populations have inherited around 2 per cent of their genome from Neanderthals: evidence of an intimacy between our species that had long been questioned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We diverged from Neanderthals around 650,000 years ago. They had similar sized brains to us and were an intelligent and social species. Despite this, the superior cognitive capacities of early modern humans &amp;ndash; evidenced through superior technology, art, and cultural practices &amp;ndash; may have allowed them to eventually outcompete our doomed cousins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the same month as receiving the Nobel, P&amp;auml;&amp;auml;bo&amp;rsquo;s team published research in the journal Science, providing compelling evidence of the genetic changes underlying this cognitive divergence. They considered the TLKT1 gene, in which only one amino acid out of hundreds differs between Neanderthal and modern human DNA. The human version of TLKT1 is preferentially expressed in the neocortex during fetal development, a region of the brain involved in complex tasks like conscious thought and language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on these observations, the team hypothesised that the human-specific changes may have been a key driver of advanced cognition during human evolution. They were able to demonstrate that the human version of TLKT1 drives significantly greater proliferation of young brain cells in the neocortex, known as neural progenitors, when compared to the Neanderthal version.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The work provides compelling evidence that a single genetic change may have driven growth of the neocortex, or a greater density of neurons within it, among early humans, potentially contributing to our cognitive advantage over Neanderthals and other extinct hominins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from our New Humanist winter edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2022/04/26/the-results-are-in/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
