<p>I went on a walk with the granddaughter and ended up at the coffeeshop, where I had promised to buy her a cookie. She picked one out — chocolate chip, of course — and we sat down, and she said, “I have to athk my mom if I can have a treat.” And she didn’t eat it! We had to bag it up and bring it home, where her mom did say she could have it.</p>
<p>It’s the <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/the-marshmallow-test-4707284">Marshmallow Test</a> on steroids! I am totally foiled in my cunning plan to totally spoil the child before she goes home.</p>

    <title>Looking back on 2022: blind faith comes in many forms</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6061/looking-back-on-2022-blind-faith-comes-in-many-forms#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/metaverse.jpeg" height="587" alt="Meet me in the metaverse illustration" width="800"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's always tough to choose, but every year our editorial team picks twenty pieces from the last twelve months to showcase. It was a year that saw war return to Europe, one where we continued to do battle against various forms of far-right and nationalistic forces. At the magazine, we were privileged to publish expert voices from the worlds of philosophy, politics and science to face these challenges and more head on, while proposing ways forward. These are extraordinary times, teaching us once more that blind faith comes in many forms: not only through established religion, but also via conspiracy theory and political ideology. Some of the pieces below captured a crucial moment, others rose above the events of an often tumultuous year to give us space for perspective, reflection and &amp;ndash; sometimes &amp;ndash; a much-needed laugh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="/articles/6021/is-psychology-the-superstition-of-our-age"&gt;Is psychology the superstition of our age?&lt;/a&gt; by Rami Gabriel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every era has its myths and rituals, doomed to seem absurd to future generations. Today, we believe in psychology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="/articles/5942/meet-me-in-the-metaverse"&gt;Meet me in the metaverse&lt;/a&gt; by Jay Owens&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As our lives become ever more digital, how do we untangle &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; experiences from virtual ones &amp;ndash; and should we?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href="/articles/6060/qa-victoria-amelina"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with Victoria Amelina&lt;/a&gt; by J.P. O' Malley&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It&amp;rsquo;s very painful to lose people in war, of course. But losing culture and history is a tragedy too...." We talk to the Ukrainian novelist Victoria Amelina about the Russian assault on culture and its importance in times of conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/laurie.jpg" height="379" alt="Laurie Taylor cleaning his soul, illustrating by Martin Rowson" width="562"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. &lt;a href="/articles/5947/eternal-cleaning-of-the-spotted-soul"&gt;Eternal cleaning of the spotted soul&lt;/a&gt; by Laurie Taylor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While his teachers preached purity, Freud gave the teenage Laurie Taylor a pleasingly different view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. &lt;a href="/articles/6009/persecuting-pregnancy"&gt;Persecuting pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; by Soraya Chemaly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The overturning of Roe vs Wade in the United States has created perverse new rights and incentives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/charles.jpeg" height="923" alt="The Prince of Wales and the Queen in Westminster Abbey, 1975" width="1300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. &lt;a href="/articles/6047/keeping-the-faith"&gt;Keeping the faith?&lt;/a&gt; by Andrew Copson&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the accession of King Charles III, we have a historic opportunity to modernise the monarchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;7. &lt;a href="/articles/5926/qa-geoffrey-nice"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with Geoffrey Nice&lt;/a&gt; by Francis Wade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The QC who led the prosecution at the trial of Slobodan Milosevic discusses genocide in China and the efficacy of international justice mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/forbes.jpeg" height="1382" alt="Rethinking the origins of life, illustration by Martin Rowson" width="1596"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;8. &lt;a href="/articles/6051/rethinking-the-origins-of-life"&gt;Rethinking the origins of life&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Forbes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Groundbreaking new research looks set to overturn our understanding of the origins of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;9. &lt;a href="/articles/5977/dystopia-by-degrees"&gt;Dystopia by degrees&lt;/a&gt; by Alice Bell&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the climate crisis deepens, so will the battle over how to tackle it.

Why are we seeking out our ancient ancestors?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;13. &lt;a href="/articles/6012/many-progressives-have-abandoned-basic-liberal-values"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with Francis Fukuyama&lt;/a&gt; by J.P. O'Malley&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Many progressives have abandoned basic liberal values...&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; We talk with Francis Fukuyama about why he believes liberalism today is badly in need of articulation and celebration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;14. &lt;a href="/articles/6044/swedens-summer-of-hate"&gt;Sweden's summer of hate&lt;/a&gt; by Dominic Hinde&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sweden has long been seen as a tolerant nation &amp;ndash; but the far right now holds unprecedented power.

<p class="lead">I’d already known that “scientist” coined by William Whewell in the 19th century, but only today did I learn the context. The first scientist by name was <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/10/20/mary-somerville/">Mary Somerville, and Whewell had to invent the term to describe her</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>Months after the publication of Somerville’s Connexion, the English polymath William Whewell — then master of Trinity College, where Newton had once been a fellow, and previously pivotal in making Somerville’s Laplace book a requirement of the university’s higher mathematics curriculum — wrote a laudatory review of her work, in which he coined the word scientist to refer to her. The commonly used term up to that point — “man of science” — clearly couldn’t apply to a woman, nor to what Whewell considered “the peculiar illumination” of the female mind: the ability to synthesize ideas and connect seemingly disparate disciplines into a clear lens on reality. Because he couldn’t call her a physicist, a geologist, or a chemist — she had written with deep knowledge of all these disciplines and more — Whewell unified them all into scientist. Some scholars have suggested that he coined the term a year earlier in his correspondence with Coleridge, but no clear evidence survives. What does survive is his incontrovertible regard for Somerville, which remains printed in plain sight — in his review, he praises her as a “person of true science.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He still managed to squeeze in some sexist stereotyping, but that’s cool. Read the whole article to find out what <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/10/20/mary-somerville/">remarkable person Somerville was</a>.</p>

    <title>Wheel out the persecution complex</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/12/27/wheel-out-the-persecution-complex/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;I mentioned before that &lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/12/06/dont-blame-america-were-not-ruining-the-coronation/"&gt;Ken Ham and Ray Comfort were going to flood London with Bible tracts for the upcoming coronation&lt;/a&gt;. The Panda&amp;#8217;s Thumb also noted the silliness of this effort. Here&amp;#8217;s the &lt;a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/12/aig-counterfeit-money.html"&gt;complete text of their comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Ham and his fellow creationist grifters plan to disrupt King Charles’s Coronation by handing out religious tracts disguised as money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hilarious. They are raising money to print and distribute 3 million counterfeit “1 Million Pound” notes that will display fundamentalist/creationist tracts on the reverse side. They are shamelessly raising money to do this. I wonder if the British Secret Service will also be amused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it! That&amp;#8217;s all they said. It was enough to fuel Ray Comfort&amp;#8217;s outrage, though. He thinks that&amp;#8217;s a serious threat to call the police on them, so he&amp;#8217;s made a video in which he intercuts clips of people getting handcuffed, of gangster firing machine guns, and then delivers a po-faced explanation of all the ways their Bible tracts differ from genuine UK pound notes. Yeah, Ray, we know. You&amp;#8217;re more likely to get arrested for littering than for seriously trying to undermine the British economy with fake money. Your greater crime will be inducing eye-strain in all the people who will be rolling their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#8217;t trigger their persecution complex, though…gotta inflate the concerns even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LyHbamkISeA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So ridiculous. They&amp;#8217;re trying so hard to pretend the world sees them as fierce and dangerous, rather than a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of jokes, if you bother to watch the video, it starts out with breathless outraged innocence, but One-Trick-Pony Ray can&amp;#8217;t keep it up for long, and it abruptly switches to another of his man-in-the-street interviews where he confronts a stranger with the question and accusation, &amp;#8220;Have you ever told a lie? Then you&amp;#8217;re a liar and are going to hell.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s a good thing for Ray that the Bible doesn&amp;#8217;t condemn people for being a repetitive bore, because he&amp;#8217;d be damned for all time. I turn off any of his videos when he starts on that tired schtick, which means I can never sit through any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Laying claim to Christmas</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6066/laying-claim-to-christmas#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A Roman Feast, by Roberto Bompiani (1821-1908)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/saturnalia-_2_.jpg" height="1035" alt="A Roman Feast (Saturnalia), Second Half of the 19th cen.. Creator: Bompiani, Roberto (1821-1908)" width="1596"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time again, when everyone is spinning in the maelstrom of cheesy TV commercials, crackers, Secret Santas, festive jumpers, hangovers &amp;ndash; and a slew of seasonal anxieties. Will the cards arrive on time? Will the promised turkey materialise? Will the new robot come with batteries? And what on earth can you get for that difficult sister-in-law?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But where, as a self-respecting sceptic, do you draw the line? You won&amp;rsquo;t, presumably, display models of the manger and the shepherds in your front garden, nor an advent calendar on the mantlepiece to build anticipation for the miracle birth. Perhaps you might be tempted to attend Midnight Mass, just for the spectacle, or to go carol-singing because it&amp;rsquo;s for charity. But will you be having a Christmas tree? And if so, how are you planning to decorate it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During these recession-plunged times, you probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend anything at all on fripperies. Instead you could just tart up your existing baubles. The Guardian shows you how to make paper snowflakes, and how to marble your balls. The website &lt;em&gt;YourHomeStyle &lt;/em&gt;recommends using chalk paint to spray over the ornaments, or over the tree for a frosty look. And if you really want to cut down, they suggest, you could always make your own chalk paint which, they guarantee, will ensure your tree will look like nobody else&amp;rsquo;s. Not always in a good way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a natural look you don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend any money at all. Just gather a few twigs, pine cones and springs of holly and smugly parade your green values. As long as you buy locally you could actually be helping the planet as many UK growers will plant new ones for every one cut down &amp;ndash; up to 10 each tree according to the Woodland Trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And real ones are far better than fake. The Carbon Trust calculates that a two-metre artificial tree has a carbon footprint of around 40kg, more than ten times that of a real tree that&amp;rsquo;s burned after Christmas. Most artificial trees are made in China, with the dual environmental impact of being made from plastic, PVC and metal, and then shipped overseas. And they&amp;rsquo;re not recyclable, so when they&amp;rsquo;re inevitably thrown away, they end up in landfill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But why have a tree at all? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re a bit chary about joining in the collective worship of the baby Jesus, alongside all the paraphernalia of nativities, carol services and church-going. But if you do crave a tree you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry that you&amp;rsquo;re subscribing to the Christian myth. Evergreen trees have been a potent symbol in numerous cultures across the world long before the birth in the stable. Christianity simply co-opted existing rituals and made them its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoCommentText"&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until after 300 BC that the emperor Constantine made Christianity a State 'religion'. Before then, the Roman's winter celebration of Saturnalia bore striking similarities to our Christmas traditions today. People lit candles, gave gifts and decorated trees in honour of Saturn, the god of sewing and seeds. Saturnalia was for some time celebrated around the winter solstice in late December, and some have argued that it is the forebear of our Christmas tradition today. Equally, it could just be that humans down the centuries have liked to feast, drink, make fire and contemplate the regenerative power of nature at the darkest and bleakest point of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Middle East many civilisations worshipped a version of the goddess Asherah, the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Heaven&amp;rdquo;. Her main symbol was a pole or a tree, which the ancient Canaanites viewed as a signifier of fertility. Druids are thought to have believed that the white berries of mistletoe represented the semen of the gods. Wreaths, in the pagan tradition, were made in a circle to stand for female fertility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoCommentText"&gt;Some pagans regard the red berries of the holly as a symbol of menstrual blood while Wiccans use holly wood to make wands. Both holly and mistletoe were hung in doorways of temples and homes to invoke powers of fertility in those who stood beneath and kissed, causing the spirits of the god and goddess to enter them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The association of the evergreen fir with carnality hasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely disappeared. A few years ago outraged residents of a northern town in Russia reacted furiously to the appearance of a phallic-looking Christmas tree outside the local concert hall. Some demanded that authorities remove the bizarre-shaped tree, which they nicknamed the &amp;ldquo;penis fir&amp;rdquo; because of its extremely bulbous bottom and shaft-like top.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No wonder they were upset. Once Christianity had taken over, with its obsessive obliteration of sex, no such base allusions were allowed, so the phallic symbols were replaced by Biblical ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red berries came to represent the blood of Christ, and the pointy leaves the crown of thorns placed upon his head as he was crucified. Wreaths, you won&amp;rsquo;t be surprised to learn, are no longer wombs. Instead they are a sign of God&amp;rsquo;s eternal love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re finding all of this stifling symbolism too much to take, you can always create your own atheist semiotic code instead. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the evergreen tree itself which in all cultures means immortality and the promise of rebirth. So it&amp;rsquo;s just as meaningful for humanists, as a celebration of the cycle of life. You&amp;rsquo;re definitely okay with tinsel, too. Simply redefine it as a manifestation of religious superstition: a shiny rope winding over the leaves of logic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what will you put on the top? Presumably not an angel which, in Christian iconography, refers to the one who appeared high in the sky on the first Christmas, heralding the birth of Jesus. A star? Sorry &amp;ndash; the star represents the Star of Bethlehem, which guided the Three Wise Men to the stable where Jesus was born.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of these you could select a favourite secular saint. How about a figure of Einstein, to demonstrate the value of science? Or Emmeline Pankhurst for feminism? One year I draped a &amp;ldquo;Votes for Women&amp;rdquo; sash round the tree, but the masculine holly snagged it to shreds. For a different version of tribal worship why not a likeness of England football manager Gareth Southgate? These are easily available and probably, these days, cut price. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to invest in a real statue, just cut out a picture and paste it on to card. I once did that with a portrait of the American actress, writer and singer Mae West, proclaiming, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;lsquo;m no Angel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="trt0xe"&gt;That was just one of her proud boasts during her seven-decade entertainment career. She was famous for her outspoken sexual appetite and bawdy one-liners. &amp;ldquo;When I&amp;rsquo;m good I&amp;rsquo;m very good,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;but when I&amp;rsquo;m bad I&amp;rsquo;m better.&amp;rdquo; And, she explained, &amp;ldquo;I used to be Snow White, but I drifted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now to the lights. Christmas trees used to be decorated with candles, symbolising Jesus as a divine light, and the star that led the three wise men. Today&amp;rsquo;s tree lights can also be seen as the stars and planets in the firmament. But for pagans, the use of light around the winter solstice represented the promise of light in the darkest time of year. Which couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more humanist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So let your Christmas tree celebrate that most sacred of secular movements: the Enlightenment. Rejoice in the sign of the rebirth of science, the glory of human endeavour, the triumph of reason over superstition, and a promise of better, more rational times to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Provided you don&amp;rsquo;t get the ones that flicker.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Harvard’s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6054/book-review-harvards-quixotic-pursuit-of-a-new-science#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Harvard University campus, 2009" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Harvard_University_campus-314.jpeg" height="668" alt="Harvard University campus" width="1019"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harvard&amp;rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science (Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;by Patrick L. Schmidt &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Harvard, a place of tradition and legacy, does not take kindly to proposals for major organisational restructuring. Yet, in 1946, a group of scholars did just that when they received permission to combine the disciplines of anthropology, sociology and social psychology into a single department. The birth, life and death of this department, called the Department of Social Relations, are described in detail in Patrick L. Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s new book &lt;em&gt;Harvard&amp;rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;It is no coincidence that Social Relations opened its doors after the Second World War, a conflict whose origins and implications Harvard&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Three&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the disciplines of history, economics and government &amp;ndash; struggled to explain. Social Relations not only copied an interdisciplinary model already in use at other Ivy Leagues, but also gave faculty the freedom to pursue emerging theories and areas of study that were not receiving adequate attention inside their respective departments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;The department of psychology was especially narrowminded in this regard. Prior to the establishment of Social Relations, psychology at Harvard was dominated by experimental psychologists. They were called &amp;ldquo;experimental&amp;rdquo; not because they were interested in exploring uncharted territory, but because they wanted to study the human mind through observable behaviour only, pushing professors Henry Murray and Gordon Allport &amp;ndash; interested in invisible mental processes &amp;ndash; to join Social Relations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Schmidt captures the intellectual drama that accompanied the development of the department. Conflicts of interest or ideas are thoroughly explained and livened up with quotes from faculty. Especially memorable is the recollection of Allport&amp;rsquo;s awkward meeting with Sigmund Freud, whose fixation with the unconscious bothered him almost as much as Harvard&amp;rsquo;s focus on behaviour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;In theory, Social Relations was meant to be an interdisciplinary program. In practice, it was more multidisciplinary, with students and teachers sticking to their primary disciplines. One of the department&amp;rsquo;s founders, sociologist Talcott Parsons, wrote &lt;em&gt;Towards a General Theory of Social Action&lt;/em&gt; in an attempt to unify the discipline, and create &lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;social relations&amp;rdquo; as a new science, but the social psychologists in the department remained unconvinced, as did many sociologists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Why write a book about a failed intellectual project? Firstly, because of what was achieved along the way. Internal division did not stop the Department of Social Relations from delivering outstanding scholarship. As the Iron Curtain dropped, the department&amp;rsquo;s Russian Research Center provided Washington with intel on the Soviet Union. Led by anthropologist and Social Relations founder Clyde Kluckhohn, the centre studied all aspects of Soviet life to determine how it would respond to attacks from the American military. Scholars say it showed research can be politically motivated while still being academically sound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Social Relations disintegrated in the early 1970s when anthropology, sociology and social psychology were once again separated into their own departments. This was due in part to a PR crisis which ensued after professors Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) gave psilocybin and mescaline to undergraduates as part of their Harvard Psychedelic Project, promoting drug use on university grounds and establishing themselves as counterculture icons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;At the time, the Leary-Alpert scandal damaged Social Relations&amp;rsquo; credibility in the academic world. Today, with attitudes towards psychedelics changing and research into their medical and mental benefits resuming, the project&amp;rsquo;s legacy is being reassessed. Equally controversial upon its inception &amp;ndash; and retrospectively ahead of its time &amp;ndash; was a 1968 course called Social Change in America, which examined imperialism, race and labour amid mounting student protests against the Vietnam War.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s book is not only an instructive story of intellectual hubris and academic scandal. It also offers insight into ongoing debates over education, knowledge, power and progress. The author&amp;rsquo;s biography might seem unusual, as he is neither a historian nor a social scientist, but an attorney in Washington D.C. However, he was present on the scene, having written his honours thesis at Harvard on the history of Social Relations, just after the department&amp;rsquo;s demise. The Social Relations department might have approved, given their open-minded approach to hiring people. For example, in 1959, the faculty welcomed David Riesman, a former lawyer who&amp;rsquo;d entered academia through the virtue of his independent research. He went on to a fellowship at Yale where he wrote &lt;em&gt;The Lonely Crowd&lt;/em&gt;, considered to be a landmark study of American character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;In the case of &lt;em&gt;Harvard&amp;rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science&lt;/em&gt;, the unorthodox approach has borne fruit. Through meticulous research and compelling writing, Schmidt has taken a set of dry, inaccessible institutional records and turned them into a gripping intellectual drama. Best of all, he&amp;rsquo;s managed to do so without sensationalising his subject or shying away from semantics. A must-read for anyone interested in how educational systems are developed and their effect on the way we view the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Why we need a radical approach to the countryside</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6053/why-we-need-a-radical-approach-to-the-countryside#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Flatford Mill (&amp;lsquo;Scene on a Navigable River&amp;rsquo;) by John Constable, 1816" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Constab_e.jpeg" height="817" alt="Flatford Mill by John Constable, 1816" width="1024"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It is the strangest doublethink. As I write, one third of Pakistan is underwater. Recently in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by David Armstrong McKay published findings that indicate global warming has already passed the threshold for triggering five disastrous tipping points, from ice-sheet collapse to permafrost thaw. Even in temperate Britain, summer 2022 brought widespread drought and the highest temperatures the country has ever recorded. We &amp;ndash; at least, &amp;ldquo;we progressives&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; know this. Yet our default, when it comes to the natural environment, seems to be a long comfortable yawn. That stuff &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo;, the barely differentiated bird and plant life blurring beyond the car windows, isn&amp;rsquo;t really worth getting to know, is it? We seem to assume it is a cultural and political dead zone, where nothing interesting could possibly happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Yet we make an exception for big-scale nature. Shades of imperial heroics haunt TV expeditions to film rare, faraway species, or beautifully judged literary works in which middle-class white men go off alone to explore mountains, woods or rivers &amp;ndash; othering even the natural environment. Of course, something is better than nothing. No one would deny that David Attenborough, or writers like Richard Deakin or Robert MacFarlane, have made a difference not only to the popularity of the natural world as entertainment, but to what we know about it. But still, this strikes a somewhat post-colonial note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to make some insulting equivalence between the human suffering Britain and other countries have already inflicted, and the suffering being inflicted on our neighbour species today. But, while unchecked climate change will eventually destroy us all, the people who will suffer first and worst will be in the global south. And in both the recent imperial past and the near future, this damage results from a culture of othering. It is a dangerous nonsense to turn the world around us &amp;ndash; like the people of that world &amp;ndash; into something we don&amp;rsquo;t need to bother with because it is both, in the immortal words of Father Ted, &amp;ldquo;small: far away&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not from London,&amp;rdquo; cry the hopelessly metropolitan protagonists of&lt;em&gt; Withnail and I&lt;/em&gt; (1987), out of their depth in the rain-soaked Lake District. But of course they are: and the satire, rounded like all the best writing, shows their agreeable heedlessness, as they leave field gates open wide, solicit a poacher in public and prove unable even to feed themselves. The natural environment is neither tiny nor distant. Today&amp;rsquo;s intellectual and, increasingly, popular cultures take the collapse of the global biosphere seriously. But not so the fact that the quotidian, vaguely apprehended British countryside is &amp;ndash; for all of us here on these islands, right now, in every moment &amp;ndash; our local natural environment. The countryside is what our urban areas sit within; and it&amp;rsquo;s what sustains them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The countryside is anything but a-political&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also an increasingly radicalised space, at the forefront of our collective attempts to manage the climate emergency. The Johnson administration was close to advocates of rewilding. Farming communities &amp;ndash; particularly in the less wealthy parts of the country often selected for such projects, because land there costs less &amp;ndash; see rewilding as a rich man&amp;rsquo;s hobby which is pricing them out of existence. Some explicitly cite parallels with the paralegal process of enclosure, which culminated in the 18th century. This saw productive agriculture, and the livelihoods of ordinary people in rural communities, cleared away to make room for the hobby parks and model farms of the wealthy. As today&amp;rsquo;s farmers point out, food comes ultimately from land, not factories; food security is an important part of biosecurity; and farming where we live slashes carbon-heavy food miles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The connection between land and food, though, often seems to be missing from rewilders&amp;rsquo; thinking: perhaps because the reality, which is that we need to find ways to farm sustainably, is so complex. Connected thought is also missing from the commercial strategy of buying up productive farmland for carbon offset sinks. Changing ownership of a green space does not create more of it. Meanwhile, amid political chaos at Westminster, the environment appears to be low on the agenda. The short-lived Truss government was not interested even in greenwashing; her September mini-budget was seen by environmentalists as a clear &amp;ldquo;attack on nature&amp;rdquo;. Sunak&amp;rsquo;s government reversed many of these measures &amp;ndash; reinstating the ban on fracking and pledging more offshore wind &amp;ndash; but ministers have repeatedly framed environmental issues as a sideshow. The early days of Sunak&amp;rsquo;s premiership were dogged by controversy over his reluctance to attend the COP27 climate summit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s gone wrong? Why can we not fix our attention on the British countryside for long enough to think and act rationally in relation to it? More than we surely realise &amp;ndash; and leaving aside the particular shamelessness of this new governmental asset-stripping &amp;ndash; this has to do with our culture. If we think of our natural environment as remote, it&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s so often presented that way. When William Morris designed his wallpapers and fabrics, in which vines and roses become a repeating frieze, he was developing what he understood as good socialist practice. In his workshops, craftsmen and women could earn their living in ways that allowed them to further their skills, and to take ownership of the (improved) results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Yet it was adoption in the nation&amp;rsquo;s gift shops that finally made these designs ubiquitous &amp;ndash; as symbols, ironically, of middle-class Britain. We no longer hear, in their handmade origins, the echo of earlier movements seeking to afford workers self-sufficiency, such as Chartism. Instead, we fall back on thinking of workers and their rights as necessarily urban. That we do so is another consequence of enclosure because the ordinary people it displaced into cities became cheap labour for the industrial revolution&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;dark Satanic mills.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;That famous phrase comes from the Romantic poet William Blake (in &amp;ldquo;Jerusalem&amp;rdquo;). It&amp;rsquo;s something of an irony that, at the very time these upheavals were taking place, Romanticism was advancing ideas of human rights centering on the inalienable status of the self as a human. We take for granted the ideas of liberty and equality, if not fraternity, that were first linked by Fran&amp;ccedil;ois F&amp;eacute;nelon at the dawn of the Enlightenment; they took their first steps onto the political stage with the Romantic-era French Revolution. On this side of the Channel, political philosophers including William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, politicised intellectuals Thomas Jefferson Hogg and James Leigh Hunt, and writers and activists including Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, were arguing for a person-centred dismantling of traditional institutions, including monarchy and marriage, and a recourse to personal judgment rather than social and religious obedience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;Let's learn from the Romantics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;So the fine-tuned Romantic &amp;ldquo;sensibility&amp;rdquo; the more conservative Jane Austen mocked in &lt;em&gt;Sense and Sensibility &lt;/em&gt;(1811) and &lt;em&gt;Northanger Abbey &lt;/em&gt;(1817) was more than self-indulgence. It was a form of heightened awareness underpinned by political philosophy. The Tory governments of the early 19th century effectively stamped out revolutionary thought, not least by repeated suspensions of habeas corpus and the right to a fair trial. This posed a threat for those it deemed subversives: many, including the Leigh Hunts and the Shelleys, went into political exile in Europe. And it&amp;rsquo;s this, rather than mere emotion or artistic expression, that&amp;rsquo;s actually going on in those Romantic representations of the natural environment which are so often, paradoxically, co-opted to present the British countryside as picturesque, old-fashioned and unchanging. In fact, these representations were urgently new: and they were created in response to an era of rapid change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Look again and the evidence is everywhere, as I rediscovered recently in writing and thinking about the Romantic encounter with the countryside. William Wordsworth &amp;ldquo;wandered lonely as a cloud&amp;rdquo; because the countryside was newly depopulated, and the sense you get when you&amp;rsquo;re alone in the high fells is vertiginous &amp;ndash; like looking up into a nearly cloudless sky and wondering why you don&amp;rsquo;t fall up into it. John Constable&amp;rsquo;s Dedham Vale, away from the worker community at Flatford Mill, is empty for the same reason, as the solitary observer becomes newly aware of every rustle or squeak. J. M. W. Turner&amp;rsquo;s wide horizons record this too, as up to date in their way as his brilliant portrayal of speed on Maidenhead viaduct in &lt;em&gt;Wind, Steam, Speed&lt;/em&gt;. Percy Bysshe Shelley&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Ode to the West Wind&amp;rdquo; takes a high wind in Florence as an occasion to evoke the human &amp;ndash; and ecological &amp;ndash; potential for change and revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m saying, then, is that in a time of crisis we need to pay attention to everything surrounding us. Not only our natural environment, but our culture. We should keep a particular eye on ideas so familiar we think they&amp;rsquo;re our own. Our assumptions about the countryside have held us back from paying attention to catastrophes unfolding there in plain sight. Such assumptions emerge from historical and cultural circumstance. They are the reason we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ignore historical moments like Romanticism, which have shaped our relationship with rural life, and which therefore cannot be &amp;ldquo;over and done&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Close up, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the Wordsworths in Somerset &amp;ndash; or Lord Byron and the Shelleys in Switzerland &amp;ndash; probably splashed about in country mud just as helplessly as Bruce Robinson&amp;rsquo;s Withnail. But the lesson of Romanticism itself &amp;ndash; rather than our reception of it as decorative clich&amp;eacute; &amp;ndash; must be its fearlessness in taking the rural environment as a site of and for radical rethinking. We too need to become unafraid of the proximity of the countryside: as the series of lived realities with which, even in town, we all relate. And if an increasingly authoritarian government claims that paying attention to such things is both uneconomic and impractical &amp;ndash; arts and humanities, anyone? &amp;ndash; perhaps we need to ask ourselves whose version of the natural environment, as of things in general, we are meant unquestioningly to accept.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fiona Sampson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Starlight Wood: Walking Back to the Romantic Countryside&amp;rdquo; is published by Hachette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6052/holiday-no-thanks#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHUmanistLaurieheadstand.jpg" height="589" alt="Laurie Taylor hates holidays" width="410"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I sidle out of bed every morning I am increasingly put in mind of the Lewis Carroll poem: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;You are old, Father William,&amp;rsquo; the young man said, / &amp;lsquo;And your hair has become very white; / And yet you incessantly stand on your head&amp;ndash; / Do you think, at your age, it is right?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In truth, I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly emulate Father William&amp;rsquo;s headstand, but I do embark on a series of rather bizarre physical exercises. Before I risk a trip to the bathroom, I check that my surgically replaced ankle is in good working order by standing on one leg for several seconds. Then I need a few minutes of running on the spot to prove that my newly fitted pacemaker is ticking over nicely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are only the more dramatic signs. They sit alongside more mundane evidence of physical deterioration: an anxiety about biting into apples, a refusal to run for buses, a declining capacity to throw up both arms in any sort of exultation, and a distinct unreadiness to bend down in a public place and tie up my shoelaces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all these corporeal concerns count for little when set against my new existential discovery. It can be simply stated: I never, ever, never, ever want to go on holiday again. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend so much as a single night in a small hotel in Paris, or a fat villa in Antibes. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to travel several thousand miles in order to look at tropical birds and a basking hippopotamus. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sit on a yacht, walk the Pilgrims&amp;rsquo; Way or be sculled through Venice by a singing gondolier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new-found reluctance to leave home has nothing to do with any anxiety about the customary hassles of travelling. It is entirely prompted by a recent aversion to nearly every one of the delights that are so regularly reported by friends who have returned from holiday. The more they tell me about their vacation, the more my resolution is stiffened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, for example, on my writing desk, is a recently received picture of Michael and Janet lounging on white plastic sun-beds beside a blue swimming pool somewhere in the south of France. &amp;ldquo;We are really away from it all at last,&amp;rdquo; runs the self-congratulatory message. The photo is in perfectly focused glossy Technicolor, but all I can see is an encroaching greyness: the perceptual deprivation induced by having nothing to stare at for hour after hour apart from a stretch of flat chlorinated water and the constant fear of losing your lounger when you depart to grab some buffet lunch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But far more relevant to my new resolution is this report from Charlotte and James. They&amp;rsquo;re an acerbic couple, always alert to hypocrisy and double standards. But still they can&amp;rsquo;t wait to tell me in an email that &amp;ldquo;Yesterday we visited the magnificent cathedral. Such a solemn and holy place, with crowds of worshippers before the renowned statue of the Virgin Mary. An unforgettable experience!&amp;rdquo; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Charlotte and James are hardly alone. Over the years, dozens of my agnostic and atheist friends who would normally no more visit a holy building than volunteer to tour the local abattoir have reported in rapturous tone on their &amp;ldquo;delightful&amp;rdquo; visits to foreign churches and abbeys and monasteries. But more than that. They&amp;rsquo;ve told me in detail about the wonders of attending religious processions and parades. &amp;ldquo;Laurie. If you look closely at the head of the procession you can see the casket that is said to contain a splinter from the Holy Cross.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I suspect that none of these factors contribute so much to my abhorrence of holidays as my loss of a critical cognitive faculty. To put it simply, I no longer have the mental capacity to pretend that matters are really better than they actually are, to simulate my delight at a merely average French seaside restaurant, or a garish Italian sunset, or an over-extended Portuguese fado, or the discovery that my hotel room bears only a parodic reference to the one featured in the brochure. I can only recall Robert Robinson&amp;rsquo;s astute observation that wherever you stay on holiday will always be less comfortable than your home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all, I have far more sensible and reasonable matters to attend to than a holiday. Tomorrow, for example, I intend to practise standing on my head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2022 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2022/04/26/the-results-are-in/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
