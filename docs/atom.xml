    <title>One of our submarines is missing</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/06/19/one-of-our-submarines-is-missing/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a submersible, actually, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t fit the song as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtbZSNHWc9E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small group of wealthy tourists went on an outing to dive down to the wreck of the Titanic, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/americas/live-news/titanic-submersible-missing-search-06-19-23/index.html"&gt;they haven&amp;#8217;t come back up yet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A search and rescue operation is underway for a missing submersible operated by a company that handles expeditions to the Titanic wreckage off the coast of St John’s, Newfoundland, in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vessel has up to 96 hours of life support, officials said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That 96 hour number is a comforting fiction, so I won&amp;#8217;t be waiting on tenterhooks for a happy ending. The Titanic wreck is about 3800 meters down. When things go wrong at that depth, they go &lt;em&gt;catastrophically&lt;/em&gt; wrong. To lose both radio contact and the ability to rise to the surface suggests a major disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe there will be a rescue in the next day or two, and then I can point and laugh at the 3 tourists who spent a quarter million dollars each to experience what must be the most terrifying thrill ride ever.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">I couldn’t get past the opening paragraphs of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-alternate-reality-of-russian-elite-during-vladimir-putins-war-in-ukraine">this article</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>While thousands of Ukrainians were fleeing their submerged homes after a catastrophic dam explosion last week, high-society Russians gathered for a glitzy restaurant festival in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, just 500 miles away from the devastating flooding.</p>
<p>The event, called Gastreet, saw some 5,000 citizens pay up to $2,000 dollars for the opportunity to listen to some of Russia’s top businessmen, restaurant owners, and influencers over the course of five days. The event also included concerts, lavish nightlife experiences, and gourmet dinners.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing that was made clear at the Sochi resort, it’s that no amount of Western sanctions, Kremlin restrictions, or spillover violence within Russia can stop the country’s rich and famous from living large—despite the raging war in neighboring Ukraine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ummm, yes? Is this news? Do you think this is a <em>Russian</em> phenomenon? People are starving in the US, and we still have our Met Galas. America continues to bomb Afghanistan with drones, it’s just too boring to make the news, while influencers get paid to pose with beer brands. Our public schools continue to get almost daily visits from fanatics with assault rifles, while a reality show called <i>Bridezillas</i> has been running on cable for almost 20 years.</p>
<p>Any time you have colossal economic disparities, you’re going to get these kinds of contrasts. Neither the oligarchs of Russia nor the investment bankers of America are going to feel any pain, and they’re all going to frolic in the wreckage of other people’s suffering.</p>

<p class="lead">The way conservatives have promoted stupid ideas on social issues to become the dominant narrative in the news is simple and interesting…and horrifying.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a cranky, bigoted idea that few people like.</li>
<li>Create a group with a catchy name that <em>does</em> sound like something they’d like: Moms for Liberty, for instance, or The American College of Pediatricians. They sound sensible and reasonable, right?</li>
<li>Find your few fellow like-minded cranks and bigots, and get them to sign up for your group. All it takes is a few to seed your cause.</li>
<li>It used to be that you’d fire up your fax machine, but nowadays it’s even easier: get on Facebook. Facebook lets any ol’ crap get through.</li>
<li>Start spamming the media with press alerts. Eventually, some gullible newspaper or television network — like Fox News — will invite you on. You’ll find more cranks and bigots.</li>
<li>Eventually, a billionaire — a demographic that’s particularly rich in idiots — will find you and throw money at you, and you’re a success.</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been happening. The anti-choice movement in this country is driven by a small number of cranky zealots who have mastered this recipe, as illustrated by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/06/15/abortion-transgender-christian-doctors/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWJpZCI6IjMxNjY3NzkiLCJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNjg2ODAxNjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNjg4MDk3NTk5LCJpYXQiOjE2ODY4MDE2MDAsImp0aSI6IjgzMWE2MmY0LTM4ZDEtNGY5NS1hYTcyLTM2ODRiMDk1MWYzOCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMy8wNi8xNS9hYm9ydGlvbi10cmFuc2dlbmRlci1jaHJpc3RpYW4tZG9jdG9ycy8ifQ.Z9BU0-uG1kom8puxLC9eIUHPUoxxNtpmqRTFcH9sBL8">The American College of Pediatricians</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>A small group of conservative doctors has sought to shape the nation’s most contentious policies on abortion and transgender rights by promoting views rejected by the medical establishment as scientific fact, according to documents reviewed by The Washington Post that describe the group’s internal strategies.</p>
<p>The records show that after long struggling to attract members, the American College of Pediatricians gained outsize political influence in recent years, primarily by using conservative media as a megaphone in its quest to position the group as a reputable source of information.</p>
<p>The organization has successfully lobbied since 2021 for laws in more than a half-dozen states that ban gender-affirming care for transgender youths, with its representatives testifying before state legislatures against the guidelines recommended by mainstream medical groups, according to its records. It gained further national prominence this year as one of the plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit to limit access to mifepristone, a key abortion drug.</p></blockquote>
<p>They’re a <em>tiny</em> group, barely qualified to pontificate on the subjects they promote, and is dominated by ideological opposition to abortion, birth control, homosexuality, and trans care. That’s the glue that holds them together, rather than an honest medical consensus.</p>
<blockquote><p>Records from early 2022 show membership of the American College of Pediatricians at about 700 people — just over 60 percent of whom self-identified as possessing medical degrees, including some holding prominent positions as hospital chiefs and a state health commissioner. The group, citing privacy, would not comment on the size or makeup of its membership.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a religious organization.</p>
<blockquote><p>Joseph Zanga, founder of the American College of Pediatricians, who had led the American Academy of Pediatrics in the late 1990s, described the splinter organization as “a Judeo-Christian, traditional-values organization” in a 2003 interview with the National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality, which promoted conversion therapy. His organization’s core beliefs are “that life begins at conception, and that the traditional family unit, headed by an opposite-sex couple, poses far fewer risk factors in the adoption and raising of children,” he said at the time. Zanga declined a Post request for an interview.</p></blockquote>
<p>They followed the Right-Wing Recipe, though, and got picked up by the worst of the worst of media, convincing audiences that they are legitimate and credible, when they are not.</p>
<blockquote><p>The group found an eager audience through conservative media, including the Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham shows on Fox News, the documents detail. Since 2016, the American College of Pediatricians has been mentioned in more than 200 articles published by conservative news sites such as Breitbart, Daily Wire, the Epoch Times, the Washington Examiner, the Blaze and the Gateway Pundit, according to a Post analysis. Its profile has continued to rise. The volume of articles mentioning the group during the first four months of 2023 was five times that of the same period in 2020, according to GDELT’s online news database.</p>
<p>“They’re part of a coordinated, politically motivated anti-science ecosystem,” said Peter Hotez, dean of Baylor College of Medicine’s National School of Tropical Medicine and an expert in misinformation.</p></blockquote>
<p>One more element to add to the formula: when their strategems are revealed and exposed, it is an <em>attack</em> on them, and they can then deploy the “silent majority” gambit.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s a silent majority out there that stands with us,” she said. “This act has awoken a sleeping giant.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The numbers may say they’re a loud minority, but they can always claim that the majority of Americans are with them, they just don’t say it aloud. This was also a popular excuse from the early days of the internet: “the lurkers support me in email,” even when they didn’t, but how could you check?</p>

    <title>Book review: Surrender by Bono</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6131/book-review-surrender-by-bono#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Our reviewer hopes for a second volume" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bono.jpg" height="748" alt="The cover art for 'Surrender' includes a black and white, close-up photo of Bono as a younger man" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story&lt;/strong&gt; (Hutchinson Heinemann) by Bono&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll memoirs are the telling of a miracle. If a musician has succeeded to the point that anybody believes their memoir worth publishing, they have triumphed over the colossal odds that stand against any bunch of earnest, spotty youths, feeling their way around instruments they can barely play, ever amounting to anything much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story related by U2 frontman Bono in &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, as its author understands, is remarkable even by that measure. The chances of Dublin teenagers gathering to make a racket in a suburban kitchen in 1976 becoming, within a decade or so, the biggest rock band in the world were virtually nil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is a series of recollections and digressions attached to 40 songs from U2&amp;rsquo;s catalogue. Though the book is more or less chronological, each chapter feels self-contained: a sketch, a parable, a confession and/or a funny story. Over the course of a long and extraordinary career, Bono has amassed a wealth of anecdotage. He relates his material with the instinctive skill of a born yarn-spinner, and an air of self-deprecating befuddlement that any of this somehow happened. There were, of course, any number of reasons why it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it did. So, Mikhail Gorbachev pitches up on his Dublin doorstep clutching an enormous teddy bear. George W. Bush gives him something of a wigging in the Oval Office. He gets repeatedly out-drunk by Frank Sinatra. He relates his encounters with the elites of entertainment, politics, tech, media and finance with deftly turned character portraits. Rupert Murdoch is &amp;ldquo;a sophisticated thinker, camouflaged by colloquialisms; Australian&amp;rdquo;, Nelson Mandela is &amp;ldquo;a wellspring of joy that defied the weight he carried&amp;rdquo;, Johnny Cash &amp;ldquo;the heavyweight champion of every room he entered except the one that contained June Carter&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is an echo in the latter aper&amp;ccedil;u of another key theme of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;. It is a book about women, although not in the way that memoirs by male rock stars often are. Specifically, it is to a large extent a book about two women. One is Iris Hewson, Bono&amp;rsquo;s mother, who died suddenly when Bono was 14: a recurring motif of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, as it is of U2&amp;rsquo;s catalogue, is Bono grappling with the uncomfortable thought that this tragedy might somehow have catalysed his success. The other is Ali Hewson, Bono&amp;rsquo;s wife: the pair met at school, and married in their early 20s. Bono still sounds like a man touchingly terrified of what might have become of him otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is not merely a great memoir by the usually lackadaisical standards of rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll autobiography. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book about music and politics, family and friendship, pride and ambition, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t wear thin even at nearly 600 pages. Indeed, there are sufficient omissions &amp;ndash; and certainly enough U2 songs &amp;ndash; to warrant a second volume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As someone present at both extraordinary occasions, I was surprised to find little reference to U2&amp;rsquo;s show at Ko&amp;scaron;evo Stadium in Sarajevo in 1997, 18 months after the lifting of the siege of the city, or their three-night stand at Madison Square Garden in New York in 2001, six weeks after 9/11 &amp;ndash; events at which U2&amp;rsquo;s rare gift for channelling a moment triumphed in difficult, volatile circumstances which most bands of their stature might have preferred not to confront.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting stretches of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; are those that reflect on the conundrums and contradictions which arise when one attempts to apply the idealism of rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll to the realities of politics. In both realms, Bono talks about the search for the &amp;ldquo;top-line melody&amp;rdquo;, the irresistible riff that lodges an idea, a sentiment, a mood in people&amp;rsquo;s heads, and sends them away humming it whether they really want to or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To a degree confounding its title, &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; serves as a brisk primer in the art of getting stuff actually done. It turns out to necessitate much the same boneheaded determination and unwillingness to shut up that drive a teenager aboard the boat-train from Dublin to London to spend days schlepping from indifferent promoter to baffled journalist with a demo tape. Though U2&amp;rsquo;s songs have not been short on utopian sloganeering, especially early on, their singer evolved into a pragmatic and effective advocate, and &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is also the story of a political education, as instructed by many of the most influential figures of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did once ask Bono if he entertained any ambitions of political office himself, and suggested that Ireland&amp;rsquo;s largely ceremonial presidency might be suitable; he replied that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to move to a smaller house. Like many of his insights into the absurdity and opportunity of an unlikely life as a mega-celebrity, it&amp;rsquo;s funny because it&amp;rsquo;s true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here for access to the full magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Martin Wolf on the crisis of democratic capitalism</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6130/martin-wolf-on-the-crisis-of-democratic-capitalism#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Martin-Wolf-author-image-sq.jpeg" height="1368" alt="Martin Wolf" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin Wolf is chief economics commentator at the "Financial Times". He was awarded the CBE in 2000 &amp;ldquo;for services to financial journalism&amp;rdquo; and in 2019 won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Gerald Loeb Awards. His latest book is &amp;ldquo;The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism&amp;rdquo; (Allen Lane). Here, he speaks to J. P. O&amp;rsquo; Malley about democratic capitalism and the greatest threats to peace and prosperity in the west.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You define democratic capitalism &amp;ldquo;as the combination of liberal democracy with market capitalism.&amp;rdquo; You believe they have to work together. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you have to look at this historically. In complex organised societies, the dominant form of wealth was land. Those who controlled the land usually also controlled the armies, which meant they controlled power, and the people, the majority of whom worked for them. Over the last two centuries, a market economy became the dominant form for creating wealth. In this economic system, which replaced feudalism, a new capitalist elite was born in which everybody had a right to try to become a capitalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that sense, it was egalitarian. Obviously, though, most people didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;make it&amp;rdquo;. But we eventually ended up with universal suffrage and democracy &amp;hellip; Crucially, capitalism created the social and economic conditions that [helped produce] a society in which people have equal value and equal merit. I believe democracy prevents capitalism from becoming a predatory plutocracy. Just as a market economy prevents a state from becoming an autocracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t international trade and capital flows (the movement of money for investment and trade) pose a serious challenge to this system?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the core tensions in democratic capitalism is that democracy is bound up with a territorial jurisdiction. Namely: you are a citizen of one country to which you are most attached, and to which you pay your taxes. But from its beginning, capitalism has had a transnational aspect. Because market opportunities exist across the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The level of prosperity that most of us now expect demands a very high level of international trade. Moreover, an essential part of international commerce is foreign investment, which allows capital to spread out across the world. A combination of trade and foreign investment has accelerated big social and economic changes in western societies, particularly with regards to deindustrialisation. This has seen the labour force in industry shrinking everywhere, though this is mainly because we can produce more and more goods with fewer and fewer people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the biggest source of instability to the global economy in recent years has been capital flows. Particularly in the uncontrolled financial sector, which was really what was behind the global financial crisis, which had a devastating long-term impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I believe we can still sustain a liberal democratic capitalist system, while having open economies. In fact, there&amp;rsquo;s no real alternative for us. An open international economy is going to be beneficial for most of humanity. It gives tremendous opportunities for development. And we&amp;rsquo;ve got to try and do better to manage the consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your latest book, &amp;ldquo;The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism&amp;rdquo;, proposes ways to beat tax dodging by multinational corporations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tax reform is one of the big issues. We need to have land [value] taxes [taxing the rental value of land]. They&amp;rsquo;re very easy to impose actually. A lot of the value created by the corporate sector, and by investment more broadly, ends up in land values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With regards to corporation tax, my view is that there is a legitimate case for allowing investment spending to be deducted from the tax base, because you want corporations to invest. But the rate of tax on profits which are uninvested should align with the top income tax. When you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with internationally mobile factors of production, which are very difficult to tax easily in an open mobile economy, where capital moves quickly, then the obvious thing to do is to reach international agreements. This will lead to further efforts to eliminate tax havens. But, more importantly, to agree on a common basis for tax, which could help raise substantially more revenue from corporations and their owners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also address the challenges faced by the World Trade Organization since it was founded in 1995. Why has cooperation not worked out as planned?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, the WTO was built around the idea that it would be possible to create a set of rules that governed all of world trade. That became more difficult, however, as the world started to divide into blocks, with the west on the one side, and China on the other. That makes it very difficult to run global trade rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of this became very politically sensitive because globalisation had not benefited everyone. That has led to a political backlash, particularly in the United States, where the welfare state is weak. The policy solution for the US has been to become more protectionist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What should have happened over the last fifteen years was a way for the west to bring the Chinese regime closer to our system. It was not impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it never happened. So we now have this rather unique problem, where we have this huge economic player &amp;ndash; China &amp;ndash; which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to fit into the underlying principles of liberal democratic capitalism, as we understand it. The Americans see this in geopolitical terms. And if you add those two things together, the WTO ceases to function, to cover all of global trade. The global order underpinning global capitalism from 1990 to 2007 has now gone. That is obvious. The question remains: how do we manage this process of reversal?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest threats to peace and prosperity in the west today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no doubt we are going through an enormously challenging period in global affairs. The war in Ukraine has created economic chaos. We also have the relationship between China and Russia and the adversarial relationship between China and the United States. It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to predict how it is all going to end up. The outcomes are potentially very dangerous. Namely: extreme global nuclear war. I&amp;rsquo;m not forecasting that. But it&amp;rsquo;s clearly a threat that is very real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the west needs to protect its political system and its economies. That means basic economic and military security. It also requires some reconsiderations of our trade relations with the rest of the world, particularly with China. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we should stop trade altogether with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, we have to be sure that a Chinese influence does not infringe on our own freedoms or interfere with our own institutions. Managing relationships with rival powers is also important. The west has failed with Russia. We cannot fail with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the climate crisis? How does the west&amp;rsquo;s relationship with China factor in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have an obligation to look after our shared planet. For the first time in history, human beings are reshaping the planet in very dramatic ways. Notably, the extreme damage that is being done to the climate system, the oceans and the biosphere. China is also part of that. We cannot solve these problems without China. It is, after all, the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. China is probably more responsible for overfishing than any other country too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But we have to compete and cooperate, while avoiding actually conflicting with China. Historically, relationships like this have often, but not always, ended up in war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relations between the United States and China are now really bad. Particularly from the American side, which has become quite paranoid. That is stupendously dangerous. And if we don&amp;rsquo;t manage that, all the rest of the arguments I present in my book will become irrelevant, because we won&amp;rsquo;t have a world that is worth living in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The paralysing pessimism of Critical Race Theory</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'Open Casket' on display in New York. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Malik.jpg" height="1026" alt="'Open Casket', a 2016 painting by Dana Schutz" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Black people are the magical faces at the bottom of society&amp;rsquo;s well. Even the poorest whites, those who must live their lives only a few levels above, gain their self-esteem by gazing down on us. Surely, they must know that their deliverance depends on letting down their ropes. Only by working together is escape possible. Over time, many reach out, but most simply watch, mesmerized into maintaining their unspoken commitment to keeping us where we are, at whatever cost to them, as to us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is the arresting image that opens Derrick Bell&amp;rsquo;s 1992 book &lt;em&gt;Faces at the Bottom of the Well&lt;/em&gt;. It is a work of existential despair, but, for Bell, the only realistic way of thinking about the place in which African Americans find themselves. Racism, he wrote, &amp;ldquo;is an integral, permanent and indestructible component of this society&amp;rdquo;. Black people &amp;ldquo;will never gain full equality&amp;rdquo;. Even &amp;ldquo;those herculean efforts we hail as successful will produce no more than temporary &amp;lsquo;peaks of progress&amp;rsquo;, short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance as racial patterns adapt in ways that maintain white dominance. This is a hard-to-accept fact that all history verifies.&amp;rdquo; Not to accept that fact was to do great mental and emotional harm. Since &amp;ldquo;racial equality is&amp;hellip; not a realistic goal&amp;rdquo;, to be &amp;ldquo;constantly aiming for a status that is unobtainable in a perilously racist America&amp;rdquo; would lead only to &amp;ldquo;frustration and despair&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Derrick Bell is not a household name. Yet few people have been more important in shaping contemporary thinking about race, particularly in the United States. From Barack Obama to Ta-Nehisi Coates, leading black thinkers have paid tribute to Bell&amp;rsquo;s inspiration. There are not many legal scholars in recent memory, wrote Michelle Alexander, the influential author of &lt;em&gt;The New Jim Crow&lt;/em&gt;, who &amp;ldquo;have [had] a greater impact on racial justice thought and advocacy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell is the godfather of what is now called Critical Race Theory (CRT). Beginning as a movement within American legal studies that brought a postmodern sensibility to thinking about the law, CRT developed into a critique of the liberal &amp;ldquo;civil rights&amp;rdquo; approach to tackling racism, a critique nurtured by a hostility to universalism, humanism and the Enlightenment. &amp;ldquo;Enlightenment-style Western democracy is&amp;hellip; the source of black people&amp;rsquo;s subordination,&amp;rdquo; wrote Richard Delgado, one of the movement&amp;rsquo;s founders, because &amp;ldquo;racism and enlightenment [sic] are the same thing&amp;rdquo;. Many of the themes that CRT champions &amp;ndash; the centrality of race, rather than of class, to discussions about social issues; the view of racism as a problem of whiteness; the significance of &amp;ldquo;white privilege&amp;rdquo;; the disparagement of the Enlightenment legacy; the politicisation of identity &amp;ndash; became much more widely suffused in 21st-century debates about race and racism, moulding thinkers from Ibram X. Kendi to Robin DiAngelo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell&amp;rsquo;s pessimism, and the arguments underpinning Critical Race Theory, were shaped by the specific conditions of America: the history of slavery, the depth of Jim Crow culture in the South, as well as disenchantment with the limited change in the material conditions of black people&amp;rsquo;s lives brought about by the civil rights movement. But these arguments have since become influential well beyond the US. Across the globe, debates about race are often unreflectingly shaped by ideas and movements originating in the US, whether Black Power in the 1960s or the contemporary culture wars. That influence, underpinned by America&amp;rsquo;s economic, political and cultural weight, makes it important that we look even more carefully at those ideas and developments, unpack the myths and unpick the arguments. In understanding the American debates we understand more also about the debates beyond the US, including in our own country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The godfather of Critical Race Theory&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Born in Pittsburgh in 1930, Bell attended the University of Pittsburgh&amp;rsquo;s law school, the only black graduate in his class, before becoming an attorney in the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. As part of the civil rights assault on Jim Crow, Bell supervised the desegregation of more than 300 schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Desegregation often led to white flight, as white families moved elsewhere rather than send their children to integrated institutions. The result was that many desegregated schools remained segregated, not by formal procedure but through informal practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This conundrum led Bell to question whether it was truly possible to rid society of racism. He had taken his first step on the road to racial pessimism. In 1969, Bell joined Harvard Law School. At the end of the decade, he published perhaps his most celebrated paper, challenging the conventional view of Brown v Board of Education, the famous 1954 Supreme Court case that invalidated state-sanctioned segregated schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Desegregation was not the consequence of a moral desire for racial equality, Bell insisted, but a pragmatic response to political needs, a recognition that segregation hindered &amp;ldquo;America&amp;rsquo;s struggle with communist countries to win the hearts and minds of emerging third world people&amp;rdquo; and was &amp;ldquo;a barrier to further industrialization in the South&amp;rdquo;. Racial progress only occurred when it aligned with white interests, and when those interests changed, any attachment to equality was ditched. Whites, he wrote, &amp;ldquo;simply cannot envision the personal responsibility and the potential sacrifice&amp;hellip; that true equality for blacks will require.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In reality, desegregation was the product of many developments. The American authorities were certainly worried about the image created by Jim Crow and wanted to minimise its propaganda value to the Soviet Union. Desegregation was also a response to the long struggle, not just by black Americans, against racism. The recognition of the immorality of American apartheid played its role, too. And the overthrow of Jim Crow, while it did not bring about the kind of equality African Americans hoped for, nevertheless helped reset the moral dial. The attitude of most Americans to issues from equality to interracial marriage was very different by the end of the century than it had been in the era of Jim Crow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Bell&amp;rsquo;s view, however, because racism was ineradicable, not only would antiracist action &amp;ldquo;not lead to transcendent change&amp;rdquo; but it &amp;ldquo;may indeed, despite our best efforts, be of more help to the system we despise than to the victims of that system whom we are trying to help.&amp;rdquo; And yet, he insisted, antiracists must continue struggling against racism even as they acknowledged that there could be no prospect of success. They had to combine &amp;ldquo;recognition of the futility of action&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;the unalterable conviction that something must be done, that action must be taken&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The well of despair&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Few who were inspired by Bell&amp;rsquo;s work tumbled as far as he did into the well of despair, but pessimism has nevertheless shaped much contemporary thinking about race. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time we ask ourselves: What if Bell was right?&amp;rdquo;, Michelle Alexander reflected in a foreword to a new edition of &lt;em&gt;Faces at the Bottom of the Well&lt;/em&gt; in 2018. &amp;ldquo;What if justice for the dark faces at &amp;lsquo;the bottom of the well&amp;rsquo; can&amp;rsquo;t actually be won in the United States? &amp;hellip; What if racism is permanent? What if?&amp;rdquo; It is a pessimism rooted in many trends: the left&amp;rsquo;s disenchantment with the Enlightenment and with the working class, the degradation of the universalist tradition, the institutionalisation of neoliberalism, the enervation of the labour movement. Like Bell himself, Alexander insists that &amp;ldquo;accepting the permanence of racism in this country does not mean accepting racism&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet challenging racism while at the same time believing it to be ineradicable has inevitably shaped the character of antiracism today. It has prompted a shift from campaigns for material change to demands for symbolic gestures and representational fairness. After all, if racism is permanent, and attempts to eliminate it futile, then antiracism becomes reduced to little more than a kind of public performance or finger-wagging at white people to make them feel guilty or, at best, an attempt to make the unfairness a little less unfair. &amp;ldquo;These days&amp;rdquo;, as influential sociologist and cultural theorist Paul Gilroy has observed, identity too often &amp;ldquo;ceases to be an ongoing process of self-making and social interaction&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;becomes instead a thing to be possessed and displayed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also becomes a thing to be guarded and policed. For, if racism is permanent and ineradicable, then combatting it cannot be about winning equality but can only be about carving out a space within which one can assert a degree of power and autonomy. Hence the demand to &amp;ldquo;Stay in your lane&amp;rdquo;. Perhaps no issue expresses this better than the controversy over &amp;ldquo;cultural appropriation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the evening of 24 August 1955, 14-year-old African American Emmett Till went with some friends to Bryant&amp;rsquo;s Grocery in Money, Mississippi. Living in Chicago, he had come to Mississippi to visit relatives. He walked into the shop and bought two cents&amp;rsquo; worth of bubble gum. Witnesses claimed that Till flirted with the white shop owner, Carolyn Bryant. Four days after the alleged incident, in the dead of night, her husband Roy Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam, who had been out of town on a trucking job, drove to the house where Till was staying and kidnapped the boy. They beat him up and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and dumping the body in the Tallahatchie River. The following month, an all-white jury found Bryant and Milam not guilty of murder. Protected against double jeopardy, the two men admitted in a 1956 interview with &lt;em&gt;Look&lt;/em&gt; magazine that they had tortured and murdered the boy. They received $4,000 for their story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Till&amp;rsquo;s mother Mamie Elizabeth Till-Mobley insisted on an open casket at her son&amp;rsquo;s funeral to expose to the world the savagery of lynchings. She invited photographers to capture the mutilated body. &amp;ldquo;I wanted the world to see what they did to my baby,&amp;rdquo; she said. Fifty thousand people saw Emmett Till&amp;rsquo;s disfigured body as it lay in its open casket in church. Millions more saw the photographs in &lt;em&gt;Jet&lt;/em&gt; magazine, causing shock and outrage. Emmett Till, and the haunting photographs of his broken body, became an indelible, almost ineffable, symbol for the burgeoning civil rights movement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than half a century later, the murder of Emmett Till generated another kind of controversy &amp;ndash; a debate over who should be allowed to depict black pain and for what reason. The 2022 biopic &lt;em&gt;Till&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Chinonye Chukwu, faced questions about whether art should be &amp;ldquo;made from the trauma of American anti-Blackness&amp;rdquo;, as one British reviewer put it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who owns black pain?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five years earlier this question had been posed even more sharply when the artist Dana Schutz painted &amp;ldquo;Open Casket&amp;rdquo;, an image of Till in his coffin, drawn from the photographs. The painting was included in the 2017 Whitney Biennial Exhibition in New York. Many objected to a white painter depicting such a traumatic moment in black history. The British artist Hannah Black organized a petition to have the work destroyed. &amp;ldquo;Although Schutz&amp;rsquo;s intention may be to present white shame,&amp;rdquo; her open letter read, &amp;ldquo;this shame is not correctly represented as a painting of a dead Black boy by a white artist.&amp;rdquo; According to Black, &amp;ldquo;the subject matter is not Schutz&amp;rsquo;s; white free speech and white creative freedom have been founded on the constraint of others, and are not natural rights.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few months later, the novelist Zadie Smith stood in front of the painting with her children. Schutz&amp;rsquo;s work did not impress her &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel very much&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but she pondered whether she, a biracial British woman, was deemed black enough for the subject matter to be hers? And what of her children? Their father is white: &amp;ldquo;by the old racial classifications of America, they are &amp;lsquo;quadroons&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Are my children too white to engage with black suffering?&amp;rdquo;, Smith wondered. &amp;ldquo;How black is black enough?&amp;rdquo; And what about Hannah Black herself? She, like Smith, is a British biracial woman. Is she &amp;ldquo;black enough to write this letter&amp;rdquo;, demanding the painting be destroyed, Smith mused. &amp;ldquo;Who owns black pain?&amp;rdquo; Smith was attempting both to untangle the absurdities of racial categories and to push back the inclination to evaluate moral rights by virtue of the group to which individuals are deemed to belong &amp;ndash; a practice inextricably bound with racial thinking, and its horrors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cultural appropriation has been defined as the &amp;ldquo;unauthorized use of another culture&amp;rsquo;s dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc&amp;rdquo; and as &amp;ldquo;an expression of privilege&amp;rdquo; which exposes that while &amp;ldquo;people of color are forced to adopt elements of mainstream white culture, white people can sample at the buffet of other cultures at their leisure, picking and choosing what they wish to consume.&amp;rdquo; The first quote is from law professor Susan Scafidi, the second from sociologist Nicki Lisa Cole, both based in the US, but these are common definitions in and outside of America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In such discussions, every culture is viewed as a fixed, self-contained unit, every culture separated from every other by a sharp discontinuity, every culture possessing a specific set of traits and forms. But what does it mean for music or a cuisine &amp;ndash; or &amp;ldquo;pain&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; to &amp;ldquo;belong&amp;rdquo; to a culture? And who gives permission for someone from another culture to use such cultural forms?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are few answers to such questions because the debate about cultural appropriation is less about ownership than about gatekeeping &amp;ndash; about the tacit rules that define social boundaries, and the legitimacy of carrying cultural baggage across those boundaries. Every society has its gatekeepers, whose role it is to protect certain institutions, maintain the privileges of particular groups and cordon off some beliefs from challenge. Gatekeepers shield not the marginalised but the powerful. Racism itself is a form of gatekeeping, a means of denying racialised groups equal rights, access and opportunities. The policing of cultural appropriation is no different, though the polarities have been reversed, and it is executed in the name of antiracism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many critics of cultural appropriation insist that they are opposed not to cultural engagement, but to racism. They want to protect marginalised cultures and to ensure that such cultures speak for themselves and are not simply seen through the eyes of more privileged groups. They want also to ensure that it is not white people but minorities that profit from the promotion of their culture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is true that cultural engagement does not take place on a level playing field but is shaped by racism and inequality. Racism ensured, for instance, that the great black pioneers of rock &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll rarely received their due, whereas many white artists, from Elvis Presley onwards, were feted as cultural icons. Yet, as poet, writer and activist Amiri Baraka has observed, the issue here is not that of cultural appropriation at all. &amp;ldquo;If the Beatles tell me that they learned everything they know from Blind Willie [Johnson]&amp;rdquo;, he told the cultural critic Leonard Schwartz in a radio discussion, &amp;ldquo;I want to know why Blind Willie is still running an elevator in Jackson, Mississippi. It&amp;rsquo;s that kind of inequality that is abusive, not the actual appropriation of culture because that&amp;rsquo;s normal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baraka is highlighting the distinction between campaigns that seek to transform the material conditions of African Americans and campaigns for &amp;ldquo;recognition&amp;rdquo; or for the policing of racial boundaries. The campaigns against cultural appropriation expose how the first has been abandoned for the second. Preventing the Beatles from drawing on the work of Blind Willie Johnson would have done little to improve black people&amp;rsquo;s lives. It would not have overthrown Jim Crow laws in the 1950s. It would not rid America of discrimination in the labour market today. Nor will preventing Dana Schutz &amp;ldquo;profiting&amp;rdquo; from painting Emmett Till protect the Emmett Tills of today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equally troubling is that a campaign such as that against Schutz&amp;rsquo;s work contains, as the American critic Adam Shatz has observed, an &amp;ldquo;implicit disavowal that acts of radical sympathy, and imaginative identification, are possible across racial lines&amp;rdquo;. African-American history, Shatz insists, following in the path of Frederick Douglass and WEB Du Bois and James Baldwin, &amp;ldquo;is American history&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;confronting it [is] a common burden&amp;rdquo;. That is precisely the perspective that has been lost through the retreat from the universalist standpoint.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As novelist Kamila Shamsie pointed out, in response to a different controversy over cultural appropriation, losing this universal standpoint is a dangerous thing. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;You &amp;ndash; other &amp;ndash; are unimaginable&amp;rsquo; is a far more problematic attitude than &amp;lsquo;You are imaginable&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an edited excerpt from Kenan Malik&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &amp;ldquo;Not So Black and White&amp;rdquo; (C Hurst &amp;amp; Co), printed in the summer 2023 edition of New Humanist. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe now to access the full magazine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Farewell to coal country</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Liberty Gas Station, Mount Storm. Credit: Dominic Hinde" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Liberty-Gas-Station-Mount-Storm-copy.jpg" height="1440" alt="A photo shows a gas station with wind turbines behind it in Mount Storm" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Most of the people here really don&amp;rsquo;t believe in what is happening with our climate,&amp;rdquo; Jerry Whisner says to me matter-of-factly over his desk in the offices of the Mineral County Commission in Keyser, West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whisner is a Republican and a native son of the county he leads, sandwiched in the mountains where West Virginia meets Maryland on the Upper Potomac River. This is &amp;ndash; or at least used to be &amp;ndash; coal country, and loyalty to mining runs deep. Every day coal trains nearly two miles long rumble up the Potomac valley on their way to the coast from the handful of still-active extraction sites. Old habits die hard, and places like Keyser are ground zero in the fight to pull America kicking and screaming towards carbon neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whisner has more important things to think about than carbon emissions. Keyser is in a region decimated by America&amp;rsquo;s opioid crisis. He believes that economic decline has made West Virginia a prime market for predatory drug gangs, and is lobbying for an interstate highway to create more jobs. Former US President Donald Trump is still popular here, despite the scandals that have dogged him. A big part of the appeal is his deep disdain for the environmental regulation that many West Virginians blame for the rapid decline of the mining sector. &amp;ldquo;Anyone that stands up and says they&amp;rsquo;re gonna bring back coal in West Virginia is great,&amp;rdquo; says Whisner, who used to be a card-carrying Democrat but jumped ship over what he saw as metropolitan dominance by coastal elites in the party.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everywhere I stop on my trip through America this is a familiar refrain, as voting patterns solidify along the urban-rural divide and educational attainment rather than economic status. Driving from Washington DC to Chicago across America&amp;rsquo;s rust belt, it is clear that the fight to wean America off carbon is about much more than just green investments and reducing emissions. The target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, outlined in the Paris Agreement, has become another front in the culture wars that the Republicans have orchestrated around wedge issues, from abortion rights to gun control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his first day in office in 2021, President Joe Biden reversed Trump&amp;rsquo;s populist withdrawal from the Paris treaty four years earlier. In 2022, after much horse-trading, the president finally pushed through the landmark Inflation Reduction Act. With $369 billion earmarked for climate change mitigation and energy security, it is the single biggest piece of climate funding in American history. The name of the package was all part of the hard sell by the White House to sceptical Democrats and a public more concerned about food prices and energy costs than climate science, but the legislation aims to cut US emissions by 40 per cent by 2040.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where are the jobs?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Mineral County because the area has been lavished with attention by the east coast press as an example of what life after coal looks like for the America of tomorrow. West Virginia alone is set to benefit from $240 million of investment in clean energy under the IRA, and Mineral County is already the site of a huge wind farm. There&amp;rsquo;s just one problem though &amp;ndash; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t create any jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The wind farm employs about three people,&amp;rdquo; Whisner says when I ask him about what green transition looks like in the valley. The only benefit the town sees is a small community fund that dishes out a few thousand dollars at a time to compensate for the county&amp;rsquo;s chronic lack of tax funds. The company that owns the wind farm is based in California and is ultimately an asset of French oil giant Total. Their press officer declined my request to speak to any of the local employees, citing tensions on the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunting for any sign that Keyser might yet be the hotbed of green renewal it has been portrayed as, in the window of a run-down theatre in Keyser&amp;rsquo;s main street I spot a placard reading CLIMATE VOTER. It belongs to Steven Satimi, a Californian who moved to West Virginia to set up a distillery on a farm in the steep-sided Appalachian valleys and who runs the community art space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are a few people that would support us and maybe do come in here because they see that sign,&amp;rdquo; sighs Satimi, &amp;ldquo;but it&amp;rsquo;s like a new food, they just prefer to stay away from it. There&amp;rsquo;s some prejudgement when you have a sign on the door like that, and that&amp;rsquo;s just how it is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about decarbonisation in Mineral County is a challenge when the populace has swung heavily behind Trump&amp;rsquo;s robust fossil fuel Republicanism. Even local Democratic senator Joe Manchin &amp;ndash; the last relic of a time when blue-collar Democrats dominated in the state &amp;ndash; owns millions of dollars of coal shares and takes campaign funding from the state&amp;rsquo;s powerful coal lobby. Manchin&amp;rsquo;s intransigence was the main reason it took two years for the White House to make the IRA a reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Driving south out of Keyser I hit a classic example of what climate finance experts call a &amp;ldquo;stranded asset&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in this case literally &amp;ndash; and one of the reasons the campaign dollars have flowed to Manchin and other friends of coal in Washington. Three thousand feet above sea level on a plateau in the Appalachians sits Mount Storm power station, a gargantuan private coal plant that is having to reach further and further afield to feed its furnaces as the mines around it close. How long the plant can survive is uncertain. Up the hill sits its nominal replacement, the colossal Mount Storm wind farm owned by the same multinational as the installation above Keyser. Just like in Keyser, though, the local community sees little benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You get some engineers coming by occasionally,&amp;rdquo; says the woman behind the till of the local Liberty petrol station with its star-spangled frontage, &amp;ldquo;but there&amp;rsquo;s nobody here getting rich off of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Is Keyser the 'hotbed of green renewal' it's been made out to be?

With its maze of roads and industrial lots, it looks identical to a hundred other small cities across America. Strung out along the banks of the Kanawha River, it sits in the middle of one of the country&amp;rsquo;s biggest coalfields. But even here, closures, increasing efficiencies and a dwindling workforce mean that the writing is on the wall for the black stuff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pride of place on the campus of West Virginia&amp;rsquo;s state legislature is given to a statue of a coal worker, but the image of the West Virginian miner as the bedrock of the economy and the state&amp;rsquo;s identity is at odds with the reality of the industry today. Work is often temporary and dangerous, with owners cutting corners to maximise profit and with better careers available outside the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The complexities of the state&amp;rsquo;s relationship with coal are laid bare by Brandon Steele, a member of the West Virginia lower house who represents Raleigh County in the southern heartlands of West Virginia coal country. Born into a mining family, Steele is anti-abortion, pro-gun and deeply suspicious of the federal government, but he is also under no illusions about which way the wind is blowing. He moved out of state to train as a lawyer rather than going down a mine, and it opened his eyes to how far behind West Virginia was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with going into the 21st century is a world economy that, by and large, wants to develop cleaner energy and wants to be carbon neutral,&amp;rdquo; says Steele, as he guides me down the grand corridors of the West Virginia Capitol. The golden-domed building is the tallest in the state, built during the region&amp;rsquo;s industrial heyday, but it now feels more like an underfunded public museum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right now we&amp;rsquo;re the fifth largest energy producer in the nation and we&amp;rsquo;re 91 per cent coal,&amp;rdquo; he points out. &amp;ldquo;A company moving in will look at that and say they can&amp;rsquo;t meet their environmental, social and governance guidance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a recent debate, Steele shocked some of his colleagues when he said that West Virginians considered coal a &amp;ldquo;deity&amp;rdquo; and that this hindered their ability to think clearly about the future. &amp;ldquo;I am not married to the mineral; I am married to the miner,&amp;rdquo; Steele tells me. &amp;ldquo;The miner is the one that needs the job. The miner is the one going home at the end of the day trying to keep the lights on. That&amp;rsquo;s who I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta look out for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The IRA means that at least some of the miners Steele talks about will have alternative careers to turn to. Green Power, a startup making electric school buses thanks to a staggering $4 billion in IRA rebates for schools across America, aims to create 900 jobs and put West Virginian engineering at the heart of every American community. When I meet him in Charleston&amp;rsquo;s freeway-bordered downtown it is not obvious that Green Power&amp;rsquo;s VP Mark Nestlen is a vital cog in America&amp;rsquo;s roadmap to carbon neutrality. The Oklahoma native talks mostly in the manner of a strategic investor, but his enthusiasm for industrial transition is real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People are thanking us for investing here,&amp;rdquo; says Nestlen, &amp;ldquo;and what we have found is that communities will rally around green tech companies that can come in and provide jobs for folks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the core aims of the IRA is to reduce American dependence on Chinese and European renewable technology, handing billions in direct and indirect funding to electric vehicle makers for production and energy technology research. Even in carbon-loving West Virginia that is welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leaving West Virginia behind, I take the freeway over state lines into Kentucky and towards Ohio. Appalachian coal used to fuel the mills and factories stretching out along the border of the three states, and as America&amp;rsquo;s fossil economy grew exponentially the entire basin of the Ohio River that links them was transformed into an industrial powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, though, many of the mills are gone, leaving behind a toxic legacy. The river is now one of America&amp;rsquo;s most polluted, dealing with a poisonous combination of industrial waste, agricultural contamination and mining runoff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;img title="The West Virginia Coal Miner outside the capitol. Credit: US Library of Congress" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/West-Virginia-miner.jpg" height="499" alt="'The West Virginia Coal Miner', a statue outside the state capitol in Charleston" width="500"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Glimpses of the future&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Cincinnati, on the river&amp;rsquo;s north bank, I navigate the labyrinth of slip roads and viaducts to the city&amp;rsquo;s old core, now regenerated and increasingly sought after by people who want to walk rather than drive to buy their morning coffee. Cincinnati votes Democrat and is publicly committed to decarbonisation and sustainability as part of its progressive politics, but its urban fabric beyond its gentrified central neighbourhoods is a mess. The sheer scale of the climate challenge facing America becomes apparent rolling along the seemingly endless miles of concrete in its car-dependent suburbs, yet even here there are glimpses of alternative, climate-friendly ways of living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here I meet Tanner Yess, perhaps Cincinnati&amp;rsquo;s only long-distance cycle commuter and the energy behind a number of radical community climate projects. His family migrated to the US from Fiji and Yess is very much at home in Lower Price Hill, a multi-ethnic working-class neighbourhood squeezed between Cincinnati&amp;rsquo;s huge railyards and the river. Lower Price Hill is a laboratory for what climate intervention across urban America might look like and Yess seeks to serve those who have been left behind in America&amp;rsquo;s rush towards middle-class dormitory towns and double driveways. When we meet he has just finished installing a new roof on a local building, part of a range of interventions to help the poorer and predominantly non-white residents cope with the weather extremes headed their way in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Climate change is a multipronged issue, so we try to bring everything together,&amp;rdquo; he says as he sips a beer in the sun. &amp;ldquo;Climate change is the ultimate FU [Fuck You], from colonisation, from segregation, whether we&amp;rsquo;re talking about Fiji or Cincinnati.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be it the Pacific or urban America, climate change hits the poorest hardest. One of the most notable features of the IRA is that alongside green technology and business subsidies, it channels finance directly to minority and vulnerable communities. America&amp;rsquo;s poorest currently struggle to afford energy and fuel, and housing is often substandard, so measures like insulation, community transport and solar panels are top of the list for the most underserved groups. Fundamentally the IRA funds projects that tackle everyday needs rather than trying to persuade people of the dangers of climate change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This isn&amp;rsquo;t about dying polar bears &amp;ndash; we need to meet people where they&amp;rsquo;re at,&amp;rdquo; says Yess pointedly. &amp;ldquo;Nobody here knows anything about the Paris Agreement or Biden&amp;rsquo;s stimulus, but they know their basement floods and that their air quality is bad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vested interests&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Cincinnati I cross into Indiana and head up towards Chicago, counting down the miles as the hills of the eastern US give way to the endless farms and open plains of the Midwest. Halfway across Indiana the freeway suddenly emerges into one of the biggest windfields east of the Mississippi, with new turbines stretching off into the distance on either side. The cheap energy that Americans have become used to is more likely to come from these huge turbine installations than from Appalachian coal in the future, and the plains are rapidly swapping grain silos for wind parks as farmers take advantage of generous tax breaks and land rents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually I roll into the small city of Evanston, just north of Chicago, on the shore of Lake Michigan. I am here for the last stop on my trip: a visit to the Institute for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern University, one of America&amp;rsquo;s leading interdisciplinary climate hubs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As a climate scientist we often like to say that our work is policy relevant but not policy prescriptive. We like to put our information out there and let policymakers run with it and make their own decisions,&amp;ldquo; says Daniel Horton, a climatologist at the institute, diplomatically. &amp;ldquo;The passage of the IRA was a big deal,&amp;rdquo; he admits though. &amp;ldquo;In the parlance of Biden and Obama it was a BFD [Big Fucking Deal], and that legislation has really put us on the right trajectory to start to decarbonise our economy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the approval of the IRA into law, climate and environmental justice experts who had fought an uphill struggle under the Trump presidency suddenly found themselves being listened to, and provided with the money to put their ideas into action quickly. The reluctance to intervene directly in climate policy is partly due to the fact that people like Horton are the epitome of the supposed &amp;ldquo;liberal elite&amp;rdquo;, the bogeyman of the Republican party and an increasingly unhinged conservative base. In reality, opposition to the IRA and climate action is underpinned by a fear that America might begin to shift away from a system that serves the rich and powerful at the expense of both people and planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Solving climate change requires systematic change, and the IRA represents a really positive big step in that direction,&amp;rdquo; Horton says optimistically, before pausing to qualify what he has just said. &amp;ldquo;Whether we can get to 1.5C change [as a limit], though, is an open-ended question.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I head for the airport along the dual carriageways lined with drive-thrus and strip malls sparkling in the spring twilight, I think again about Horton&amp;rsquo;s realist approach. America may now be broadly headed in the right direction, but there are still countless fights to come. Its green revolution will likely be less about building utopias than about coercion, adaptation and giving people a reason to leave old loyalties behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How taxpayers subsidise evangelism</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'The current state of the law means that religious organisations are given government-backed support to promote their views'" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanist_.jpg" height="1414" alt="An illustration shows the Archbishop of Canterbury, King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as painted figures on stained glass windows" width="1920" is=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity sector in England and Wales is enormous. Over 180,000 organisations today benefit from tax relief, better access to grant funding and the reputational cachet of being a registered charity. The justification for this special treatment is that charities are supposed to act for the public benefit. It might surprise you, though, to discover just how many of these charities are religious in nature. In a search I recently made of the charity register, the term &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo; was included in the &amp;ldquo;objects and activities&amp;rdquo; section of nearly 20,000 organisations. Of these, a significant proportion specifically included the &amp;ldquo;advancement&amp;rdquo; of Christianity or other religions as one of their purposes &amp;ndash; by which they claim their right to charitable status.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, everyone who pays taxes or votes in England and Wales today is helping to subsidise the advancement of religion by thousands of organisations, and to support its approval by the state. This is despite the fact that the country itself is less and less religious. The results of the 2021 census have revealed that less than half of the population (46.2 per cent) are &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo;, while 10.6 per cent follow minority religions, and 37.2 per cent have &amp;ldquo;no religion&amp;rdquo;. Christianity has decreased significantly from the last census in 2011, while non-religion has increased.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite this, charity law continues to consider the &amp;ldquo;advancement of religion&amp;rdquo; as in itself a purpose which qualifies an organisation to be a charity &amp;ndash; quite separately from any other charitable aims such as advancing education or relieving poverty. In theory, such an organisation must demonstrate that its advancement of religion is publicly, and wholly, beneficial. But in practice, the Charity Commission, especially in the last decade, seems to have put little effort into requiring organisations to produce evidence to prove this. The current state of the law means that religious organisations &amp;ndash; particularly those associated, however loosely, with a mainstream faith &amp;ndash; are given government-backed support to promote their views. Why is merely &amp;ldquo;advancing religion&amp;rdquo; enough to qualify an organisation for the privileges of a charity?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea of charity, in Europe at least, has its roots deep in Christianity. &amp;ldquo;Now abideth faith, hope, and charity,&amp;rdquo; wrote St Paul, as translated in the King James Bible, &amp;ldquo;but the greatest of these is charity.&amp;rdquo; But while the Church encourages the practice of giving alms to the poor and other worthy causes, it has also long taught that one of the worthiest causes is giving to itself. This was already a target for satire in Chaucer&amp;rsquo;s Canterbury Tales. &amp;ldquo;Therfore in stede of wepynge and preyeres / Men moote yeve silver to the povre freres,&amp;rdquo; he wrote ironically of the rapacious Friar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first modern law about charity in England, the &amp;ldquo;Statute of Charitable Uses&amp;rdquo; of 1601, contained in its preamble a list of purposes, donations for which were to be protected from misappropriation. Some &amp;ldquo;charitable uses&amp;rdquo;, such as &amp;lsquo;&amp;ldquo;Releife of aged impotent and poore people&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Schooles of Learninge&amp;rdquo;, are still familiar. &amp;ldquo;Religion&amp;rdquo; itself was not on the list, although the &amp;ldquo;Repaire&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;Churches&amp;rdquo; was, among other public works. In 1891, however, the &amp;ldquo;advancement of religion&amp;rdquo; was definitively established by the House of Lords as a distinct &amp;ldquo;head&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;rdquo;) of charity, along with the advancement of education, the relief of poverty and &amp;ldquo;other purposes beneficial to the community&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Any religion is better than none'&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 20th century, there was a legal presumption that the first three heads &amp;ndash; on religion, education and relief of poverty &amp;ndash; were inherently of &amp;ldquo;public benefit&amp;rdquo;. Thus there was usually no need for religious organisations to provide any evidence that advancing their faith would benefit wider society. As the High Court put it in the case of Neville vs Madden (1962), which concerned a synagogue trust, &amp;ldquo;As between different religions the law stands neutral, but it assumes that any religion is at least likely to be better than none.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, the Charity Commission &amp;ndash; the government organisation responsible for regulating charities &amp;ndash; seemed willing to judge for itself whether advancing a particular religion was in fact solely &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo;, or beneficial. In 1999, it held that the Church of Scientology could not rely on the presumption of public benefit, because it was relatively new. It had also failed to demonstrate that its activities were of public benefit. Finally, the Commission held that Scientology was not a religion in the first place: although its faith did involve a &amp;ldquo;supreme being&amp;rdquo;, its practices did not count as &amp;ldquo;reverence or veneration&amp;rdquo; of that being. (Which leads, of course, to the knotty question of how a secular body like the Commission is supposed to determine what is or is not a religion.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2004, the Commission rejected the application of Good News for Israel to register as a charity, because one of its objects was to promote Aliyah, &amp;ldquo;the return of Jewish people to the land promised to them by God&amp;rdquo;. This, the Commission concluded, had &amp;ldquo;implications&amp;hellip; beyond the religious and spiritual&amp;rdquo;, raising &amp;ldquo;political, economical, social and civil order issues&amp;rdquo;. This disqualified GNI from registering, because, as is still the case now, the purposes or &amp;ldquo;charitable objects&amp;rdquo; of a charity, as set out in its governing document, must all be charitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was only in the Charities Act of 2006 that the &amp;ldquo;presumption of benefit&amp;rdquo; for religious (and other) charities was finally removed. The new state of affairs, as the Commission put it, was that &amp;ldquo;advancing religion can be seen as a public good if such advancement can be demonstrated to be in relation to a system having a benign and positive content which is being advanced for the benefit of the public&amp;rdquo;. Parliament had belatedly recognised that the benefits of advancing a particular religion could not be taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Charitable advantages&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least, that was the theory. There were, however, warning signs that the presumption of benefit for religions might not be displaced so easily. One of these was the Labour government&amp;rsquo;s refusal to insert &amp;ldquo;or belief&amp;rdquo; into the relevant clause that confirmed the &amp;ldquo;advancement of religion&amp;rdquo; as a charitable purpose. Adding &amp;ldquo;or belief&amp;rdquo; would have brought the clause into line with other legislation, like the Equality Act 2010, which recognised &amp;ldquo;religion or belief&amp;rdquo;, including lack of belief, as a protected characteristic under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, taken together with the prohibition on discrimination under Article 14.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There seems to have been a feeling that there were enough charitable purposes already, and any deserving non-religious-belief organisations would be covered by a clause allowing stated purposes to be extended by analogy, or else they could be considered educational charities. This had been the case for the South Place Ethical Society (SPES), now Conway Hall, which won a court battle in 1980 to give it recognition as a charity under the &amp;ldquo;advancement of education&amp;rdquo; head &amp;ndash; specifically, &amp;ldquo;education in humanist ethical principles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, the &amp;ldquo;advancement of religion&amp;rdquo; remains in the Charities Act 2011, which replaced the 2006 Act. Now is the time for this clause to be repealed. Above all, because it perpetuates a systemic favouritism towards religious organisations which is not justified in modern Britain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Register a charity and your organisation will receive a host of benefits. Gift Aid and other tax advantages, like on income tax and stamp duty, business rates relief and better access to grant funding are only some of these perks. Add to that improved public trust and confidence in your organisation, including from having a registered charity number and information being shown on the public register.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, registering as a charity enables an organisation to be subsidised by the taxpayer, to obtain additional funding more easily and to benefit from the reputational cachet of being a charity on the official Register of Charities, with an appearance of oversight by a government body. These are significant advantages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who benefits?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The very concept of &amp;ldquo;advancing religion for the public benefit&amp;rdquo; is riddled with problems. Some of these emerge from the Commission&amp;rsquo;s own guidance on the issue, first published in 2008 (it has been marked as &amp;ldquo;under review&amp;rdquo; since at least 2018).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the guidance, to &amp;ldquo;advance religion&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;to promote or maintain or practise it and increase belief in the supreme being or entity that is the object or focus of the religion&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; for example by &amp;ldquo;seeking new followers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;promoting particular tenets&amp;rdquo;. As an example of &amp;ldquo;promoting tenets&amp;rdquo;, it posits an Islamic charity that could help Muslims in hospital to &amp;ldquo;observe the requirements of the Islamic Halal practice&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no explanation of how this practice &amp;ndash; involving the consumption of ritually slaughtered animals &amp;ndash; might benefit anyone beyond those individuals concerned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or take a real example: the Christian Science Society, Oxted, which first registered in 1965. The sole purpose of this registered charity is &amp;ldquo;to maintain and spread the truth as set forth in the Bible and interpreted in &amp;lsquo;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&amp;rsquo; by Mary Baker Eddy&amp;rdquo;. In Chapter XII of this curious text, first published in 1875, Eddy proclaims that &amp;ldquo;If you believe in inflamed and weak nerves, you are liable to an attack from that source. You will call it neuralgia, but we call it a belief&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Whatever this means, it is hard to see how promoting such a tenet would be for the public benefit &amp;ndash; or, indeed, what basis the organisation has for characterising their unprovable beliefs as &amp;ldquo;the truth&amp;rdquo; in a public secular document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seeking new followers&amp;rdquo; certainly benefits the religions themselves. As the Evangelical Alliance, a Christian charity, put it in 2008, &amp;ldquo;religious organisations need to be able to sustain themselves into the future, something that has always been done through the medium of evangelism&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and through the extraction of funds that inevitably follows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the ability of religious organisations to fund themselves cannot be of public benefit, unless the practice of the religion itself is. Most of the examples the guidance offers of the benefits of a religion, such as &amp;ldquo;the spiritual and moral education of children&amp;rdquo;, primarily concern its adherents rather than the public, or else would qualify under other heads of charity, such as the relief of poverty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Advancing religion could, the guidance says, &amp;ldquo;contribut[e] towards a better society, for example by promoting social cohesion and social capital&amp;rdquo;. On the other hand &amp;ndash; a point which the guidance does not consider &amp;ndash; advancing one religion at the expense of others, or other non-religious beliefs, could also sow mutual distrust. Altogether, the guidance is nebulous and weak on what should be the crucial section, namely why advancing religion &amp;ndash; whatever the content of its teachings &amp;ndash; should qualify an organisation to receive public money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A fourth, practical difficulty concerns how the Charity Commission is supposed to determine whether the views and practices of thousands of religious charities are of public benefit &amp;ndash; or whether they might be positively harmful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Examples of types of harm associated with religious charities include conversion therapy, circumcision, political extremism and discriminatory religious &amp;ldquo;courts&amp;rdquo;. These were discussed in &amp;ldquo;For the Public Benefit?&amp;rdquo;, a 2019 report by the National Secular Society. More examples keep coming to light. Take the Moray Coast Baptist Church, which registered as a charity in August 2022. Its pastor, Donald Clough, posted a sermon on its website in which he said that &amp;ldquo;society would be a lot better if women would submit to their husbands and tend to their children and take care of their home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The conclusion drawn by the NSS report still holds: the Commission is &amp;ldquo;not regulating the sector as rigorously as it should&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5 reasons to change the system&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another question concerns equal treatment between religious and non-religious organisations. Not more than a handful of organisations advocating non-religious views have applied to register as charities via the &amp;ldquo;analogy&amp;rdquo; clause. The biggest one that has is Humanists UK (HUK), whose first charitable object (out of four) is &amp;ldquo;the advancement of Humanism, namely a non-religious ethical lifestance the essential elements of which are a commitment to human wellbeing and a reliance on reason, experience and a naturalistic view of the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, after an extensive campaign by HUK, the Commission accepted &amp;ldquo;the advancement of Humanism&amp;rdquo; as a charitable object in its own right. This seemed tacitly to admit that the &amp;ldquo;advancement of religion&amp;rdquo; could be extended to non-religious beliefs by analogy, thereby avoiding claims for discrimination under the ECHR.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Religion, however, remains the paradigm. Indeed, the Commission&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of humanism, according to Richy Thompson of HUK, was &amp;ldquo;without prejudice as to whether the advancement of other beliefs might be considered charitable&amp;rdquo;. In other words, it seems to have been a decision on the particular merits of humanism (as defined by HUK), not on the general desirability of non-religious views.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, one of the prejudices that non-believers have always faced in Britain, and continue to face today in some quarters, is that without the guidance of a religion, they have no moral code by which to orient themselves. HUK&amp;rsquo;s characterisation of humanism as an &amp;ldquo;ethical lifestance&amp;rdquo; seems to have been partly shaped in response to this perception; the motto on its website, &amp;ldquo;think for yourself, act for everyone&amp;rdquo;, illustrates the explicitly moral outlook adopted by this organisation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet no one seems to have considered whether a non-religious approach might be beneficial, not because it is still moral despite not being religious, but rather because it does something that is not analogous to religion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, the purpose of Atheism UK (which is not a charity) is to &amp;ldquo;challenge religious claims and the propagation of religious faith&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; not to present a moral code. My own magazine, the &lt;em&gt;Freethinker&lt;/em&gt;, is funded by Secular Society Ltd, which is also not a charity, even though it is a non-profit whose objects include promoting the &amp;ldquo;utmost freedom of enquiry&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apparently criticising belief systems is less beneficial to society than simply propagating them. The only charity that came up on the Register under &amp;ldquo;atheism&amp;rdquo; was Genexis, an organisation run by an evangelical church in Leamington Spa. Its sole object is, &amp;ldquo;for the public benefit, the advancement of the Christian faith worldwide with a particular emphasis on cultures and geographical areas which are facing a rise in secularism, humanism and atheism, in particular by advancing the case for theism (as opposed to atheism) based on scientific, philosophical and historical evidence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, an organisation whose explicit aim is to oppose atheism can be charitable, but not one designed to promote it. This is not to argue that every association of unbelievers ought to be a charity. Equally, organisations from Humanists UK to the Church of England can, and do, still qualify as charities under other perfectly legitimate heads, such as the &amp;ldquo;promotion of religious harmony&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;advancement of education&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; one of the purposes of the Rationalist Association, which publishes &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt;. My objection is simply to the specific provision of &amp;ldquo;advancing religion&amp;rdquo;, or even humanism, as a separate head of charity, for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Because this provision is unfairly biased in favour of established religions, as opposed to either new religions or many non-religious approaches to life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. It assumes that propagating a belief system or ideology is better than criticising it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. The Charity Commission is either reluctant or does not have the resources to question the public benefit of many charities whose only purpose is to &amp;ldquo;advance religion&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. The provision adds a superfluous head of charity to an already inflated list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. Charities that qualify as such purely for &amp;ldquo;advancing religion&amp;rdquo; are often undeserving of public support. (Even Humanists UK, as Richy Thompson said, &amp;ldquo;would be happy to see the advancement of religion removed as a head of charity&amp;rdquo; and would be prepared to dispense with the &amp;ldquo;advancement of humanism&amp;rdquo; by the same token.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When religion meets politics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also a final reason why &amp;ldquo;advancing religion&amp;rdquo; should be removed as a head of charity: because religious ideologies are so often closely entwined with politics. According to the Commission&amp;rsquo;s current guidance on &amp;ldquo;Campaigning and political activity&amp;rdquo;, charities &amp;ldquo;can campaign to achieve their purposes. But a charity can&amp;rsquo;t have a political purpose, or undertake political activity that is not relevant to the charity&amp;rsquo;s charitable purposes.&amp;rdquo; The reason for this is that, &amp;ldquo;constitutionally, it is not possible for the Commission or the Courts to make decisions about whether a change in the law or government policy would be for the public benefit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, despite the prohibition on political purposes, the Charity Commission&amp;rsquo;s own guidance recognises that &amp;ldquo;campaigning and political activity can be legitimate and valuable activities for charities to undertake&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; provided that such activity be undertaken by a charity &amp;ldquo;only in the context of supporting the delivery of its charitable purposes&amp;rdquo; and does not become &amp;ldquo;the reason for the charity&amp;rsquo;s existence&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might wonder if there were a certain equivocation here. Moreover, in its most recent update to its guidance on political campaigning, published in November 2022, the Commission emphasised that &amp;ldquo;campaigning, advocacy and political activity are all legitimate and valuable activities for charities to undertake.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such guidance is hardly likely to strengthen the already thin line between religious and political beliefs. Moreover, religious charities frequently run campaigns for or against legislation &amp;ndash; such as on assisted dying, abortion, same-sex marriage or hate speech laws. In contrast, organisations which, like the National Secular Society, do not invoke any sort of belief system cannot benefit from government subsidies when campaigning, usually against religious groups, on the same issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The subsidies also continue. In July 2022, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities announced grants for 16 religious charities to work in partnership with secular authorities on community projects, under a pilot &amp;ldquo;Faith New Deal Fund&amp;rdquo;. Among these was the (Anglican) Church Revitalisation Trust (CRT), whose charitable object is &amp;ldquo;the advancement of the Christian religion&amp;rdquo;, and one of whose aims on its website is &amp;ldquo;the evangelisation of the nation&amp;rdquo;. CRT received a grant of &amp;pound;200,000 to help &amp;ldquo;plant&amp;hellip; churches in key cities across England and Wales&amp;rdquo;, as well as to &amp;ldquo;recruit and train clergy&amp;rdquo;. In other words, more government money is being used to prop up the Church of England.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the last resort, the decision whether to lend support to an organisation promoting Paganism, Pastafarianism, Christianity, atheism or none of the above, should be a matter for the individual conscience. Retaining a clause like the &amp;ldquo;advancement of religion&amp;rdquo; effectively gives some religious beliefs and practices a free pass to subsidies and status on a preferential basis, regardless of whether they offer any real benefit to the public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only just way forward would be to repeal the clause. This prospect seems distant, however, given the current religious influences on both the Conservative and Labour parties. This is unfortunate, because the longer religious organisations are allowed to cling on to their privileges, the harder it will be to take them away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p></div>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
