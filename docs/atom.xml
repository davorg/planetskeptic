    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Robert Pirsig's 1974 bestseller continues to serve as a gospel for long-distance bikers" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/iswanto-arif-m1nHYuMvBAI-unsplash-small.jpg" height="1448" alt="A man on a motorbike in the mountains" width="1448"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, published in 1974, was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon. A work of fictionalised autobiography, the book follows its author Robert Pirsig on a long motorcycle ride through the US, from Minnesota across the prairie to Oregon, then down to southern California. The muscles of that skeletal journey are Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s philosophical musings on the notion of Quality. Pirsig created the concept in order explain the relationship between human values and societal values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At once both obvious and ephemeral, Quality escapes easy definition. (And brings to mind American supreme court justice Potter Stewart&amp;rsquo;s comments about pornography: &amp;ldquo;I know it when I see it.&amp;rdquo;) In his original formulation, Pirsig describes it, not a little paradoxically, as &amp;ldquo;a characteristic of thought and statement that is recognised by a non-thinking or intuitive process.&amp;rdquo; At another juncture, Quality is defined as the event which occurs between the observer and the observed. Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s search for clarity stretched his mind to the breaking point, ultimately landing him in a psychiatric facility where he was subjected to electroshock therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet, the concept has been influential. The book, a bestseller, continues to be read by motorcyclists, philosophers and everyone in between. This year, a long-awaited collection of writings has been published for the first time, giving us a deeper look at how Pirsig shaped his concept. Edited by Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s widow Wendy, an archivist and Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s frequent collaborator, On Quality uses outtakes from unpublished letters and lectures, and from Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s two books (Zen and 1991&amp;rsquo;s Lila). It is an intimate and highly selective look at his journey through the work of the early Greek philosophers, Asiatic mysticism and beyond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again and again, he approaches the concept from different angles, employing simile, analogy and deductive reasoning. Often, he only tightens the knot he has created. But there are moments of brilliance. In a letter written in 1995, Pirsig outlined where he saw Quality fitting among the pantheon of religious philosophy, placing it beside Hinduism&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Oneness&amp;rdquo; Buddhism&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Nothingness&amp;rdquo; and the monotheist&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; as a fourth path leading up &amp;ldquo;the mountain of understanding&amp;rdquo;. Optimistically, he singles out Quality as the one that cannot be dismissed by the &amp;ldquo;scientifically minded&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;meaningless, metaphysical claptrap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quality then, is a kind of religion, though one preaching improvement for its own sake, rather than in the service of some deity. It is less concerned with eternal life than with the pursuit of truth and beauty. Much of its appeal lies in Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s prose, which combines his repetitive, mantra-like style with a pragmatic, matter-of-fact charm. The book is illustrated with photos of his collection of tools &amp;ndash; spanners, drills, pliers and the like &amp;ndash; a reminder that this was a philosopher with dirt under his fingernails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The goal of truth&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I first read Pirsig in 2012, while preparing for my own long motorcycle journey, from the Canadian prairie to the Argentinian Pampa. It strikes me now as a voyage from one cattle country to another, though at that time it was too sinuous and ill-planned to be so clearly defined. I had none of Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s discipline, but like him, I struggled to find meaning in what I was pursuing. Was I travelling as catharsis? For freedom? For evasion? Adventure seemed the most likely reason, but I was too often alone and inconsolable to convince myself of that pursuit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Quality is the quasi-religion of what Pirsig called the &amp;ldquo;Church of Reason&amp;rdquo;, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is its holy book. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one to treat it as such. Motorcyclists I met on that trip, and have met since, talk about Zen as a kind of compendium for life. Like most adherents, there was among them more enthusiasm (which means, as Pirsig points out, &amp;ldquo;filled with theos&amp;rdquo;, or God) for Pirsig than drive for understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Zen was first published, motorcycle travel literature was not yet the identifiable genre it is today. That variety of travelogue began in earnest in 1979 with the appearance of Ted Simon&amp;rsquo;s Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s Travels, the story of a five-year round-the-world odyssey between 1973 and 1977. If Pirsig was a kind of modern Homer, Simon was like Virgil: pagan and worldly, inured in scholarship of prose, yet beset with laurels of deism. &amp;ldquo;Of all the gods in the pantheon,&amp;rdquo; he wrote, &amp;ldquo;Jupiter is the one I fancy most. A lovely name, Jupiter, like cream and honey in the mouth. And a sense of great distance and closeness at the same time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compare that to Pirsig, who wrote in Zen that &amp;ldquo;The primary goal of the Church of Reason... is always Socrates&amp;rsquo; old goal of truth, in its ever-changing forms, as it&amp;rsquo;s revealed by the process of rationality.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why motorcyclists might choose the path of Simon&amp;rsquo;s self-aggrandisement over Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;goal of truth&amp;rdquo;. There was always the temptation to play at being god. While my own pan-American odyssey was underway, I came to recognise a particular mindset in fellow riders: an air of being separate in space and time, of being out of reality and untouchable. There were plenty of vengeful Odins and chaotic brothers of Mars riding into town with conquering on their minds. My own choice of god at the time was the callous and boozy Dionysus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unambiguously foreign, strangely dressed, noisy, incorrigible, we rode our machines across the world as though it were the plains of Troy. We were given beds, food and love &amp;ndash; offerings we accepted as tributes for our appearance on the battlefield. When we left, it was not uncommon for crowds of people to appear to see us off. The effect was inebriating, nectar for the ego. Today, those events put me in mind of Patrick Kavanagh&amp;rsquo;s poem &amp;ldquo;Epic&amp;rdquo;, which ends with the lines: &amp;ldquo;Till Homer&amp;rsquo;s ghost came whispering to my mind. / He said: I made the Iliad from such / A local row. Gods make their own importance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wreaking havoc&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But therein lies the trouble with gods &amp;ndash; they do not go out into the world to learn, but to teach, to wreak havoc, have their way with mortals; they live in the world as they want it, rather than as it is. Passing through one country after another, often without our &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo; documents, and with the freedom of our vehicles, we felt that we had passed beyond the rules of society. I rode all over the Americas illegally, my expired paperwork needing only a few flicks of my pen to change the date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why travelers feel out of step with the world around them. Society is largely based on repetition and reliability, neither of which travel provides. But enough time ignoring the rules and a detached superiority begins to settle in. And then, the worst: bored with the thrills offered by the natural world, by spontaneity, by socialising, such riders turn from life to arithmetic: tallying up miles ridden, countries entered, tyres blown, meals eaten. Quantity becomes synonymous with merit, and the most venerable are those who have &amp;ldquo;done more&amp;rdquo;. As the urge to quantify rises, Quality suffers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simon ends Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s Travels with this reflection: &amp;ldquo;Often I dream of riding over the hard red floor of a great forest, beneath a high canopy of translucent green, spreading on and on. An enchanted forest, perhaps, where men may still sometimes play at being gods.&amp;rdquo; Pirsig ends Zen in a very different manner, by saying that &amp;ldquo;to understand Quality, he would have to leave the mythos.&amp;rdquo; It continues: &amp;ldquo;[he] emerges as if from a dream, seeing that his whole consciousness, the mythos, has been a dream and no one&amp;rsquo;s dream but his own, a dream he must now sustain of his own efforts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is much to admire in motorcycle writing, but too much of it today is a poor imitation of the genre&amp;rsquo;s forefathers. We will not produce another writer like Robert Pirsig until we can differentiate quantity from Quality. And we have to stop playing at being gods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This article is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p class="lead">Did you know that <a href="https://answersresearchjournal.org/social-issues/central-role-darwinism-vietnam-war/">Charles Darwin caused the Vietnam War</a>? The Answers Research Journal says so!</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Darwinism was a major influence on those persons who birthed, inspired, and supported the Vietnam War. This includes Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Ho Chi Minh. Charles Darwin’s (1809–1882) ideas helped to guide these leaders to Social Darwinism, which was an underpinning of the Communist and the National Socialist (Nazi) ideologies. Darwinism also played a central role in contributing to the conditions that eventually led to the American involvement in the Vietnam War, including the Communist Movement. The decade-long war, from 1965 to 1975, cost as much as three million lives during the time the U.S. was involved.</p>
<p>Darwinism, especially Social Darwinism, played a central role in contributing to the conditions leading to the communist domination of North Vietnam. Social Darwinism is the belief in the importance of the “survival of the fittest”—the idea that certain people are innately better than other people. Marxism, the political and economic theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, was developed by their followers to form the basis for the theory and practice of communism. Darwinism is a biological theory of the origin of different life-forms through the natural selection of life forms better able to survive their environment. In contrast, Social Darwinism, is a consequence and progression of Darwin’s theory best summarized as “survival of the fittest.” Social Darwinism is an underpinning of communism and National Socialist (Nazi) ideology.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a Jerry Bergman production (remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpEhVvALhUM">Jerry Bergman</a>?), so it rambles on and on with nothing but bald assertions and a lot of ahistorical nonsense. It scarcely touches on the role of colonialism and capitalism, which all preceded Darwin, and instead what drove the Vietnamese revolutionaries was Darwinism. Not French oppression, not a desire for independence, naw…they read the <i>Origin of Species</i> and bam, decided to overturn the natural order.</p>
<p>It really is typical Bergman. Repetition, repetition, repetition, and I couldn’t finish it.</p>

They bumped the character limits from 140 to 280 for most people, and I have no idea what the limits are for the suckers who paid for their blue checks, but now we’re getting these long rambling rants from all the weirdos.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/aigkenham.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/aigkenham-150x51.png" alt="" width="150" height="51" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-69449" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/aigkenham-150x51.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/aigkenham.png 204w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"/></a>Ken Ham bought his precious blue check mark, of course.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/aigkenham/status/1630186661320572929?cxt=HHwWgoC-mbSIy58tAAAA">doesn’t like public schools</a>. Take a deep breath.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Well, I realize this post may “stir the pot” somewhat, and I’ll brace for the responses!  Should Christians send their kids to public schools? Now firstly I want to say it’s the parent’s decision as to where they send their kids to be educated.  And I do recognize in a fallen world there are all sorts of family issues (eg: single parent families) for varied reasons.</p>
<p>However, at the very minimum, each Christian should build their thinking on God’s Word in regard to the training of children, and do the best they possible can, with much prayer &amp; God’s help and hopefully the help of God’s people in the church, to attain to what God instructs as much as we are able.</p>
<p>From God’s Word we do get answers to:  Who owns children? Parents &amp; ultimately God. Who is responsible for the education of children? Parents, &amp; in particular Fathers as the spiritual head.  What is the priority of education? Spiritual/biblical worldview. What should we understand about children?  They are not miniature adults &amp; they have a sin nature. What warnings are there?  Bad company corrupts bad character.</p>
<p>Many people in the church have told me their kids should be in the public school to witness to other kids.  But what’s the biblical basis for this?  When I ask, I’m usually told, “we are to be light and salt in this world.” Yes, true, but one can only shine light if one has it to shine.  Yes, Matthew 5:13 states “you are the salt of the earth,” but Mark 9:50 also states, “Have salt in yourselves.”</p>
<p>Your kids can’t be salt till they have salt. And by salt it means they are to be filled with biblical truth, but also prepared with answers (1 Peter 3:15) to be able to withstand the attacks of the devil in the world they live in.  That’s why @AiG provides all sorts of curricula for churches &amp; homes to help raise generations filled with biblical truth &amp; equipped to defend the Christian faith against the attacks of our day.</p>
<p>Now Scripture also warns in Matthew 5:13, that “But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.”  In other words, contamination destroys.</p>
<p>Before our kids can be a witness to the world, they need to be filled with salt, as uncontaminated as possible, to know what they believe and why and be equipped to defend their faith.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, most of the public school system indoctrinates kids for 6 or so hours a day in the secular worldview of evolutionary naturalism &amp; sexual humanism. Most churched kids have not survived the public education system and have walked away from the church. Very few exceptional kids from church homes survive and are able to be salt and light.  Most become severely contaminated. This is reflected in the fact there’s been a massive generational loss from the church. </p>
<p>Bottom line, are you putting your own kids at risk from contamination because you want them in the system to witness to others? But how much have parents &amp; the church really made sure such kids are truly filled with salt to be able to do this? Most churches have not taught apologetics and most have compromised God’s Word in Genesis, opening the door for that contamination to take hold.  Most father’s have not been the spiritual head of their house as they should.  Look at the evidence, most of the younger generations have walked away from the church.  Generation Z is the first post-Christian generation &amp; very atheistic in worldview.</p>
<p>Remember, when your kids are born, they don’t know about the bible, or Adam and Eve, or sin, or the promise of the Savior, or the Flood, or Babel, or the cross, or resurrection, or the saving gospel, or how to answer the attacks of our day.  Our job as parents is make sure they are taught and equipped so they can impact the world for the Lord Jesus Christ.  Where are your kids spiritually? What legacy are you leaving in the younger generations? Who really has the greatest educational impact on your kids and grandkids?</p></blockquote>
<p>I can answer that last question. If you’re talking about <em>educational</em> impact, it wasn’t my parents. I loved my parents, I thought they were great role models, they taught me to love knowledge, but I had to attend a public school to learn algebra, and grammar, and spelling, and basic chemistry, and home ec, and to read Melville and Dickens and Austen and Baldwin, and the framework of history. They weren’t educated as teachers and had <em>work</em> to do, and when they had free time, they wanted to <em>enjoy</em> being with their family.</p>
<p>Mr Ham’s problem is that he was never educated at all, and thinks learning about <q>the bible, or Adam and Eve, or sin, or the promise of the Savior, or the Flood, or Babel, or the cross, or resurrection, or the saving gospel</q> is an education. It wasn’t. He was fed lies.</p>
<p>Oh, but wait. To prove his point, Ham gives us some helpful illustrations.</p>

<p>Well, now I’m convinced. He’s an idiot, but he has some cheap-ass graphic illustrators working for him who can churn out appallingly bad images.</p>
<p>There’s more from the loquacious Mr Ham! Wait until you see his <a href="https://twitter.com/aigkenham/status/1630546465960370176?cxt=HHwWgICx1eXX7qAtAAAA">rant about science</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Want to learn about true science? Are your kids being indoctrinated by secularists in our secular institutions who don’t teach kids correctly about what science is and isn’t? Tired of the secular science programs that brainwash generations of kids in the anti-God religion of evolution/millions of years?</p>
<p>Real science confirms the Bible! But, sadly, many science programs don’t glorify God as the Creator. Instead, they teach humanism and atheistic evolutionary ideas to children. Because of this, many parents find it challenging to find engaging science programs that glorify God—but not anymore!</p>
<p>[cut short because it’s a lot of boring lies]</p></blockquote>
<p>Real science is honest inquiry in which you can question and test your assumptions, and aren’t required to distort your answers to fit the Bible, which is <em>not</em> a science text. But Ken Ham has lots of money to fund his propaganda.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">It looks like it’s time for me to go on a blocking rampage on Twitter, because the TERFs/GCs are flooding my account with stupidity. There’s only so much of that that I can take. The problem is that Graham Linehan noticed me, and the flock of dim &amp; bigoted fanatics who follow him are piling on. One of them noticed that I breed spiders and thinks that is an excellent gotcha.</p>
<div id="attachment_69434" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/sex-denialist.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/sex-denialist-500x758.png" alt="" width="500" height="758" class="size-large wp-image-69434" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/sex-denialist-500x758.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/sex-denialist-99x150.png 99w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/sex-denialist-198x300.png 198w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/sex-denialist.png 584w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One thing I find gratifying is that sex-denialists like @pzmyers wibble on about sex being socially constructed and bimodal. But when they actually want something done (in this case breed spiders) – they suddenly know there are exactly 2 sexes and it’s the females that make eggs!</p></div>
<p>I make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3DRoxe7Pik">movies of spiders mating</a>, as he notices, but somehow he thinks I’m a “sex-denialist” and that somehow this contradicts my position on trans rights. Surprise! I actually know how sex works. I understand that making an embryo requires a fusion of two gametes. I would think all of the trans folk he despises would be more conscious of these distinction than he is.</p>
<p>I also know the logical difference between the fact that many females make eggs, and the idea that all females must make eggs. I also know that even in spiders there’s more to sex than tab A goes into slot B.</p>
<p>I also have information on that. I’m mainly interested in spider sex as a means to an end — I need lots of embryos — but to get there I’ve been making observations of spider behavior. Every morning I move a male spider into a container with a female spider, slide it under a dissecting scope, and watch what happens. Sometimes courtship and mating are swift and dramatic, and I click a button and record the whole process, and that’s what you see. Sometimes they take their time, and I have to watch them dawdle and fumble around for a half hour before anything happens. Sometimes I give up and put the pair in an incubator overnight and hope something happens. Rarely, the female just murders and cannibalizes the male. Of the clutch of spiders that emerged in January, I’ve got 11 females who successfully mated and produced an egg sac; I’ve got 16 that spurned the male I provided and are effectively childless. Those I don’t record, because two wallflower spiders avoiding each other isn’t particularly interesting.</p>
<p>What’s going on? I don’t know. My focus isn’t on the behavior, but on the development of embryos. But who knows — maybe there are gay and lesbian spiders. Maybe some are asexual. Maybe there are timid spiders and bold spiders. Maybe some spiders are unattractive and no one wants to have sex with them. Maybe the Adult Spider Female is focused on her bug-munching career, and doesn’t want to make babies. Maybe some pairs of spiders have cellular incompatibilities that prevent fertilization. Maybe for some spiders the behavior works, but the plumbing is atypical. These are all interesting possibilities, and if a student were to come along and ask to make a quantitative analysis of mating behavior and reproductive success, I think there are a lot of good questions to ask and some useful studies to make, because sex, even in a small arthropod as driven by instinct as a spider, isn’t binary, isn’t a question of did they or didn’t they, and exhibits a range of complex variation that I haven’t tried to plumb.</p>
<p>Other people are looking into that! A paper by Angelekakis, Turutzek, and Tuni (2022) looked into mating rates in <i>Parasteatoda</i>, and as I’d expect, it’s complex. Spiders can be choosy — the majority of females didn’t mate at all (as I’m seeing in <i>Steatoda</i>), and many would mate only once and then be done with the whole messy business (they store sperm, so one successful mating is sufficient for a lifetime of egg production.) </p>
<p>As usual, the TERFs/GCs try to ignore all that and shoehorn everything into a simple binary. It doesn’t work for spiders, and it especially doesn’t work for humans, who have layered on so many variations and subtleties and tangled them all up with non-reproductive cultural behaviors. This @nathankw nitwit tried to argue that sex can’t be bimodal because I can’t provide a single numerical parameter that shows a range of values for sex. The problem isn’t that I can’t, it’s that I can provide so many. Receptivity, courtship initiation, web twanging frequency, successful insemination frequency, dancing intensity, abdomen size, interval since last courtship, metabolism levels…I can think of so many measures that don’t exhibit the kind of fixed values that he wants for males and females. It’s overlapping ranges all over the place! In spiders! But he wants to pretend that human sex is simple, nothing but sperm and ova.</p>
<p>Graham Linehan really didn’t have anything to contribute, other than to claim my biology is a religion, and to add this silly little bon mot:</p>

<p>But if humans can’t change sex, why is this crowd so opposed to gender affirming care, hormonal treatments, and surgery? If sex is an unstoppable freight train that can’t be diverted, then let them continue with their ineffectual efforts to change sex. Except that they keep seeing the inescapable evidence that sex can and does change.</p>

    <title>Book review: The Age of the Strongman</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6085/book-review-the-age-of-the-strongman#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ageofstrongman.jpg" height="697" alt="The Age of the Strongman by Gideon Rachman" width="462"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Age of the Strongman&lt;/strong&gt; (Bodley Head) by Gideon Rachman&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rivalry between democracy and autocracy promises to define much of this century. The Age of the Strongman by the Financial Times&amp;rsquo; chief foreign affairs commentator Gideon Rachman attempts to explain how we got here. The central thrust is that, since the 1990s, the rise of a certain type of leader has become the key feature of &amp;ldquo;the most sustained global assault on liberal democracy since the 1930s&amp;rdquo;. By profiling 14 current-day leaders with authoritarian tendencies &amp;ndash; from central Europe to South America to the Philippines &amp;ndash; Rachman hopes to provide &amp;ldquo;political liberals&amp;rdquo; with an &amp;ldquo;understanding of what they are dealing with&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachman begins with an outline of the &amp;ldquo;playbook&amp;rdquo; that has propelled strongmen into power. A common tactic is populist nationalism, which paints the strongman as a national saviour, pitting an ethnically and/or religiously defined nation against outside threats such as minority groups, migrants or a shadowy elite. In power, the erosion of civil liberties is a natural consequence. Rachman reminds us how strongmen have subjugated ethnic and religious communities in their countries. Whilst China&amp;rsquo;s Xi detains Uyghurs in &amp;ldquo;re-education&amp;rdquo; camps, Narendra Modi has effectively stripped millions of Muslims of their Indian citizenship. Independent institutions and organisations are neutered. While some strongmen, like Viktor Orb&amp;aacute;n, are known for hollowing out their country&amp;rsquo;s independent media, others, like Vladimir Putin, preside over countries where journalists regularly turn up dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachman refuses to explain the rise of this authoritarianism through the talents of strongmen alone, nor does he assert that certain countries are predisposed to this rule. Chapters on Boris Johnson and Donald Trump dispel the myth that the west is impervious to democratic decline. Instead, Rachman argues that the success of strongmen is a &amp;ldquo;symptom of the crisis of liberalism&amp;rdquo;, which has economic, political and diplomatic dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Driving this crisis, according to Rachman, is an &amp;ldquo;overconfidence in the power of liberal ideas born from &amp;lsquo;victory&amp;rsquo; in the Cold War&amp;rdquo;. This prevented politicians and commentators from judging the true character of strongmen early in their careers. Rachman includes himself in this, going so far as to quote from one of his past articles that celebrated Modi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;thrilling&amp;rdquo; rise. The free market&amp;rsquo;s most ardent defenders have since had to reckon with the compatibility of the system with authoritarianism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But despite beginning what promises to be a meaningful critique of the liberal world order, Rachman never quite gets down to it. Instead, he regresses into clich&amp;eacute;. His acknowledgement of the ills of globalisation is descriptive at best. The term &amp;ldquo;neoliberalism&amp;rdquo; is dismissed as an invention of the populist left, as if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the object of serious academic enquiry. Meanwhile, strongman critiques of the liberal world order go unexplored. Grievances against US foreign policy, Nato and the EU &amp;ndash; some of which may be justified &amp;ndash; are dismissed. It is unclear what Rachman has learnt from reckoning with post-Cold War politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This reversion to type is finalised in the book&amp;rsquo;s conclusion, where the strongman is dismissed as a short-lived fad, and we are told to trust the US to lead a new &amp;ldquo;human-rights based world order&amp;rdquo;. Rachman fails to take seriously the US&amp;rsquo; vulnerability to a Trump-like resurgence, or the grisly legacy of its foreign intervention since the Second World War. In the end, his pages are haunted by the same liberal overconfidence he finds complicit in the rise of the strongman. To strengthen liberalism against rising authoritarianism requires tougher questions of its historical record; perhaps even a consideration about the case for reinvention, something Rachman firmly rules out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Is there any value to this unregulated research?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In 2015, at the age of 44, Parrish flew to Bogot&amp;aacute;, Columbia, to receive dozens of experimental gene therapy injections, with the goal of turning back her biological clock. By that time, she had founded her own company, BioViva. For her first public appearance as CEO, she had chosen to address the immortalist group People Unlimited, where she told a receptive crowd that she wanted to cure ageing, and do it fast enough that they could all benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;What dreams may come&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In our obsession with getting more sleep, we are overlooking the strange mysteries of night terrors and other parasomnias, writes Diletta De Cristofaro&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Vernon&amp;rsquo;s reflections on Dracula, the protagonist of Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s 1897 novel, note that he causes paralysis, somnambulism and night terrors in his victims.

Peter Salmon asks, how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In Christianity we are born with sin and spend our lives trying to repay that debt. In capitalism we must keep earning to stop our financial debt growing. This moral imperative is analogous with the prevalent framing of fitness today as an endless and unresolvable quest: one can always be fitter, and not pursuing this goal is a failing to oneself and to society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A: Anna Lembke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The program director of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Fellowship talks to &lt;strong&gt;J.P. O'Malley&lt;/strong&gt; about how to create a healthy pleasure-pain balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;What I have seen over two decades of clinical work is parents who have assiduously insulated their children not just from painful experiences, but really any kind of challenging experiences. This means that children haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to build up the mental strength they need to live in the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The spring 2023 issue of New Humanist is on sale now! &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt; for as little as &amp;pound;10 a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in this issue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2302-38-41-Jain-_1_.jpg" height="1064" alt="Indian widows are standing up for their rights" width="1596"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanket Jain &lt;/strong&gt;meets the women fighting back against India&amp;rsquo;s regressive widowhood traditions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen Stout&lt;/strong&gt; reports from Ukraine, where she joins the search for a missing writer taken by Russian forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt;Sometimes voters get it wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Eliane Glaser &lt;/strong&gt;asks why we find this so hard to admit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Euan Lawson&lt;/strong&gt; makes the case for drug consumption rooms, to tackle the UK's scandalously high rates of drug-related death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samira Ahmed &lt;/strong&gt;dives into the new trend for witch-lit.

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Mass graves in Izium, Ukraine" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2K1D0CX.jpg" height="667" alt="Mass graves in Izium, Ukraine." width="1000"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It was a beautiful, fresh October day in the pine forest near Izium, eastern Ukraine, when I walked among the empty graves, avoiding the discarded plastic gowns and gloves &amp;ndash; the Russian army trash. The sandy ground, once a place for picnics, was marred by gaping holes, splintered coffins, makeshift markers and spooled police tape. 447 people had been exhumed here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ahead and behind me, Ukrainian writers &amp;ndash; from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and elsewhere &amp;ndash; also lost for words, were moving slowly through the carnage. They had come, a &lt;br&gt;busload of them, to the recently liberated areas east of Kharkiv, looking for news of their colleague Volodymyr Vakulenko. Looking for grave 319, and hoping that the rumours were true, that he was never there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;He was a very special man,&amp;rdquo; his friend Maksym Bespalov told me, then immediately corrected himself. &amp;ldquo;He is a very special man. Idealistic.&amp;rdquo; They&amp;rsquo;d met more than a decade ago &amp;ndash; Volodymyr was hugely active in the literary scene, publishing almanacs and magazines, getting published himself and winning awards for his books and poetry, organising festivals and encouraging younger writers. He turned to children&amp;rsquo;s books after the birth of his son. Maksym tells me Volodymyr &amp;ldquo;tries to be everywhere, involved in everything. A little bit crazy, perhaps. But we like him because he is him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;What are his ideals, I asked Maksym. Without hesitation, he replied: &amp;ldquo;For all of the good versus all of the bad&amp;rdquo;. Volodymyr was an idealist; an outspoken, strident patriot who didn&amp;rsquo;t just write about the Ukrainian struggle but put himself on the line during the revolution of 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Those who loved and admired Volodymyr &amp;ndash; and there are many &amp;ndash; had hopes he was in a Russian prison, awaiting trial. &amp;ldquo;We all understand the most truthful version is that he is dead,&amp;rdquo; Maksym said bluntly. &amp;ldquo;But when we speak about Volodya, we always say that we hope he&amp;rsquo;s still alive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It was a hope shared by Olena Ihnatenko, the writer&amp;rsquo;s mother. Our next stop, once we&amp;rsquo;d made it through half-destroyed Izium and down cratered roads to the village of Kapytolivka, was Olena&amp;rsquo;s flat. She lives with her husband Vasyl and, now, Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s son Vitalik, who has autism and cannot speak. Volodymyr had hoped that the fact he was Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s sole guardian would mean the soldiers would leave him alone. He was wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Abducting a civilian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;We all crammed into the flat and sat on the floor around Olena and Vasyl, like schoolchildren being told a story. They described the bombardment, the month in a cellar, the freezing cold and near-starvation. Then the troops arriving in the bombers&amp;rsquo; wake. Volodymyr, who had been living with Vitalik and his own father elsewhere in the village, apparently ran out when the soldiers came, and shouted, &amp;ldquo;The rashists are here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rashist&amp;rdquo; is a neat portmanteau of Russian, racist and fascist that provokes ire in Russian soldiers: it expresses the widely-held Ukrainian view that Russians are now little different to Hitler&amp;rsquo;s forces, which also invaded at 4am, 81 years earlier. It was in keeping with Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s stubborn, proud and undaunted character that he would shout this as the invaders arrived. It was also incredibly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Vasyl, with pure white hair and bushy eyebrows, seems a kind, gentle old man; as he speaks to us he is calming Vitalik, stroking his shoulder and murmuring to him. Vitalik is rocking, agitated, staring at the strangers. He knows what&amp;rsquo;s going on, his grandmother insists &amp;ndash; just can&amp;rsquo;t express himself. The idea of this highly strung, nervous boy being seized by troops is almost incomprehensible. But on 22 March, that&amp;rsquo;s what happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s your nationalist?&amp;rdquo; a soldier nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Bes&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Demon&amp;rdquo;, had demanded of Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s elderly father. His men turned the house upside down looking for pro-Ukrainian literature. Volodymyr, sensibly, had hidden the flags he&amp;rsquo;d kept from his time on the Maidan &amp;ndash; Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Revolution of Dignity&amp;rdquo;, which overthrew corrupt ruler Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Both Volodymyr and Vitalik were taken to a nearby &amp;ldquo;special department&amp;rdquo; for a few hours, where Volodymyr was beaten, then both were returned home. Olena thinks it was probably a mistake that they took Vitalik. But Volodymyr knew they&amp;rsquo;d be back for him. It was at this point he took a shovel and dug a hole under the cherry tree in his father&amp;rsquo;s garden. He buried the notebook in which he&amp;rsquo;d been describing their life under occupation.&amp;ldquo;Give it to our guys [as everyone calls the Ukrainian Armed Forces] when they come,&amp;rdquo; he told his father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;A little later the soldiers returned, grabbed the writer while he was cooking on an open fire in the garden, and threw him into a bus on which they&amp;rsquo;d daubed their infamous invasion symbol, the latin letter &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The torture of not knowing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;For Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s ex-wife, Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s mother Iryna Novitska, the lack of information was unbearable. She lives in central Ukraine and had begged him, as everyone had, to get out while he still could. Their last communication was on 7 March when he&amp;rsquo;d called to say troops had entered the village. Then a message, later that night: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve wiped my phone contacts&amp;rdquo;, to protect their identities from the soldiers, in case he was picked up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The mobile networks were knocked out, one by one. Silence. Kapytolivka, like all the other villages and towns the Russians occupied, was swallowed up. It just disappeared into an information blackout for six long months. Relatives in free Ukraine had no idea if their loved ones in the occupied territories were hungry or fed, wounded or safe, imprisoned, scared . . . dead. Meanwhile, those inside the &amp;ldquo;dark zone&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t know what had become of the rest of the country. Propaganda from Moscow told them lies: Kharkiv has fallen, Kyiv has fallen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In the occupied towns, troops &amp;ndash; both from Russia and conscripts from the so-called &amp;ldquo;republics&amp;rdquo; of Donetsk and Luhansk &amp;ndash; roamed the streets, drunk and dangerous, searching men for &amp;ldquo;patriotic&amp;rdquo; tattoos, and taking them to torture cells, ten of which were later found in Izium alone. Informers were apparently active in the village. Volodomyr&amp;rsquo;s family suspect this is how he was picked up. Long before the invasion, he had predicted that the neighbours would turn him in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Throughout the spring and summer, 71-year-old Olena, struggling with the lack of food, medicine, gas, water and electricity, traipsed back and forth to checkpoints and distant military commanders&amp;rsquo; offices, searching for information about her son, and pleading with the Russians to let him go. The couple made written statements to the new &amp;ldquo;authorities&amp;rdquo;; detailed descriptions of Volodymyr and his arrest. The men promised they weren&amp;rsquo;t holding him; scoffed at the very suggestion. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not Nazis!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Some rumours reached her; that her Vovka was in Russia, awaiting trial. Or in a prison in occupied Donetsk. After the region was liberated in September, there was a terrible confusion over the mass grave lists: &amp;ldquo;Vakulenko&amp;rdquo; from Kapytolivka was listed. But no date of death was given, and authorities said it was a woman&amp;rsquo;s body in that pit. Could it have been a mistake? &amp;ldquo;I am living on hope,&amp;rdquo; Olena told me, that day in October. &amp;ldquo;I have to. He&amp;rsquo;s my only son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The Executed Renaissance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The idea that a children&amp;rsquo;s writer can be murdered because he believed in his own country is so absurd, so appalling, that you want to find another version of events to believe in. But actually, none of the writers I was with seemed surprised by what had likely happened to Volodymyr. Horrified, deeply angry, but not surprised. The killing of writers and artists, of creative people who shape a national culture, is nothing new in the grim history of Ukrainian&amp;ndash;Russian relations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Back in Kharkiv with the writers, I stayed one cold and eerie night in a building that stands as testament to Russia&amp;rsquo;s repeated attempts to wipe out Ukrainian cultural life: the House of the Word, or Slovo. Built in the late 1920s, it contained high-end apartments that accommodated Ukrainian writers and intellectuals. They were prized by the state in the brief period when Kharkiv was capital of Soviet Ukraine and had a flourishing literary scene. But then came the 1930s. The very idea of Ukrainian culture became anathema. In the countryside, Stalin killed millions with man-made famine, and in Kharkiv&amp;rsquo;s Slovo he killed the poets, playwrights and novelists. I lay awake in the dark listening to intermittent air-raid sirens and thinking of the night-time knocks from NKVD officers which preceded the execution of 33 of this building&amp;rsquo;s residents. But their senseless deaths &amp;ndash; many in a camp in northwest Russia &amp;ndash; did not prevent this group, known as the Executed Renaissance, from having a lasting influence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Victoria Amelina is their cultural descendant: a writer who vividly describes life, who is actively engaged in that old, old struggle to build a sovereign, free Ukraine. It was she who dug up Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s notebook in September, shortly after the Russians had fled Kapytolivka. She was in the area to document war crimes with an NGO. It took a few minutes of digging to find the little parcel. The day made a lasting, deep impression on her. &amp;ldquo;When you&amp;rsquo;re digging up the diary of a kidnapped writer from under a cherry tree, well &amp;ndash; you feel you&amp;rsquo;re somewhere in the 30s, when our writers were shot. Or in the 40s, under Nazi occupation,&amp;rdquo; she told a TV news crew covering the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Victoria [who was interviewed in the Summer 2022 &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt;] kept a little acorn from the garden that day, a physical memory, and was still carrying it in her pocket when we spoke in November. &amp;ldquo;You know they took literature from his room?&amp;rdquo; she asked me. &amp;ldquo;Books with blue and yellow, or the trident [the Ukrainian national symbol]. They took some as proof of his being Ukrainian, they equal this with &amp;lsquo;Nazi&amp;rsquo;. This is how genocidal logic works.&amp;rdquo; With the family&amp;rsquo;s permission she handed the diary to the Kharkiv Literary Museum for safekeeping. &amp;ldquo;The museum has manuscripts of writers from the Executed Renaissance period; it&amp;rsquo;s symbolic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;When I go to the museum, on a cold November day marked by power blackouts and snowfall, the curator, wearing white cotton gloves, gently pulls back the tissue paper and shows me the densely scrawled text, in black and red biro, scored out in places and spilling over into the margins. The very last line Volodymyr wrote in the diary he buried &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I believe in victory!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; is the same line I hear across Ukraine, day after day, week after week, as the war grinds on and people cling to their faith in their armed forces to drive out the occupier. Belief &amp;ndash; hope &amp;ndash; is non-negotiable. You must keep it, in order to keep going in the face of horror and terror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But hope can be terrible too. After the bodies from the mass graves were exhumed and taken to Kharkiv for analysis in September, the family were told to wait for DNA results. Olena still felt her son was alive. Nobody released from Izium&amp;rsquo;s many torture basements had seen Volodya that whole time. Perhaps he&amp;rsquo;d gone to prison?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In mid-November, while in Donbas reporting near the front line, I got a message from Iryna Novitska, Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s ex-wife. &amp;ldquo;Hope has turned to darkness,&amp;rdquo; she said simply. A photograph had emerged: gruesome, awful and irrefutably depicting Volodymyr before he was buried. Olena had seen it. It was all over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ukrainian journalists found the man who took the picture &amp;ndash; a local, tasked with collecting bodies and burying them in the pine forest during the occupation. He&amp;rsquo;d taken photos so relatives could identify the bodies later. Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s body had not been taken from a morgue or basement but from a spot by the side of the road where he may have lain for weeks. The body had bullet holes in the stomach and chest, from a Soviet-era &amp;ldquo;Makarov&amp;rdquo; pistol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Echoes of the past&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The next day I took a detour on the way back to Kharkiv, to see Olena one last time. She was heartbroken and furious, thinking back to those long months walking, exhausted, round the checkpoints for information. She recalled a meeting in April with a Russian commander, how he looked at the wall behind her, not meeting her gaze: &amp;ldquo;He said, &amp;lsquo;We&amp;rsquo;re looking, there&amp;rsquo;s no information&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and I knew then that he knew everything,&amp;rdquo; she said, shaking with anger. &amp;ldquo;Where my son was, what happened to him, everything. There was not the slightest point &amp;ndash; everyone knew, but no one was going to say.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s cartoons were playing in the background, and he was laughing at the TV. She hadn&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to tell him yet. He and Volodymyr were joined at the hip. It pained her that this boy was left without a father. She won&amp;rsquo;t be able to cope with his 24-hour-care for ever. Volodymyr used to joke with his mother that he&amp;rsquo;d live a long life, always taking care of Vitalik, going to a nursing home together in old age so they could be together for ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh and what have you done,&amp;rdquo; she cried suddenly, berating her son. &amp;ldquo;What have you done, oh God, oh my God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As a writer, his ex-wife Iryna said, Volodymyr &amp;ldquo;tried to say something in a way that no one had said before&amp;rdquo;. He loved the unusual, the amazing, the unique; his interests were wide-ranging, and though his heart and soul were in the Ukrainian fight, he made common cause with other people living under the shadow of Moscow&amp;rsquo;s empire: the Crimean Tatars, Armenians, Ichkerians, Belarussians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The investigation into who shot him and why will go on, as will countless others; a long slow reckoning that will never provide all the answers. But the soldiers who took Volodymyr were clear: it was his &amp;ldquo;nationalism&amp;rdquo; that made him guilty. So many stories like this have been uncovered, of Russian soldiers convinced by propaganda back home that Ukraine is a nest of Nazis. Stripping people and ransacking houses for &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; like blue and yellow ribbons, trident tattoos, books in their own language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Too often in this war, the echoes of the past are deafening: not just of the atrocities committed by the Nazis, but of Stalin&amp;rsquo;s terror the decade before that. We, in recent years, comfortably consigned all that to history, at least in Europe. The mass executions and jackbooted soldiers, the columns of tanks and sadistic torturers, informants and brave resisters, existed in a black-and-white era.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;To the Ukrainian woman digging up a diary of a disappeared children&amp;rsquo;s writer, just a few miles away from the heavy stench of mass graves, it is not history. Victoria Amelina thinks she knows why it&amp;rsquo;s happened again: there was never any reckoning for the Soviet Union&amp;rsquo;s crimes in Ukraine. And certainly no reckoning for what she calls the &amp;ldquo;annihilation of an entire generation of Ukrainian culture&amp;rdquo; in the 1930s: the execution of all those writers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As there were blacklists then, there are blacklists now, she concluded. Activists, influencers, people to be removed first. The Russians [according to Ukrainian authorities] came with 45,000 body bags. &amp;ldquo;But they expected to win the war in three days,&amp;rdquo; Victoria said. &amp;ldquo;So those thousands of body bags were for whom? For me, I guess, and everyone else like me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Bob Dylan on his Never Ending Tour" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/EBJ281.jpg" height="1075" alt="Bob Dylan does not intend to age gracefully" width="1596"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a footnote to his essay &amp;ldquo;The Uncanny&amp;rdquo;, Sigmund Freud recounted what might today be called a &amp;ldquo;senior moment&amp;rdquo;. Sitting one night in a private train compartment, he suddenly sensed the presence of an &amp;ldquo;elderly gentleman in a dressing gown and a travelling cap&amp;rdquo;. The intruder wasn&amp;rsquo;t a ghost &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re talking Freud here, not Jung &amp;ndash; but he was a spooky and unwelcome apparition nonetheless, and the psychoanalyst &amp;ldquo;thoroughly disliked&amp;rdquo; his appearance. So he decided to tell this stranger to scram but, when he looked again, he realised that there was no one there. His adversary was nothing more than his &amp;ldquo;own reflection in the looking glass&amp;rdquo;. Doh!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Among the indignities of growing old is a feeling of disconnection between the eternal self of the mind and the physical self in decline . . . I think. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know for sure because I&amp;rsquo;m only 41 &amp;ndash; a similar age to when the Jewish-born Bob Dylan recorded the unfocused yet daring &lt;em&gt;Shot of Love&lt;/em&gt;, his third largely Christian-themed album, back in 1981. If early middle age is still a time of peering around the bend to see what&amp;rsquo;s coming next, the slide towards old age is one of self-examination and settling accounts. Or so I gather from Dylan, who spent his forties in the 1980s promiscuously experimenting with world-views and audio production styles that were at odds with those of his first creative peak in the mid-1960s, only to drift back towards familiar ways and influences in the 1990s, then find mastery once again around the turn of the new millennium as a living museum-cum-R&amp;amp;D lab of traditional American musical forms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Now 81, Dylan is as vital an artist as he ever was &amp;ndash; indeed, more so &amp;ndash; as listening to his most recent collection of songs, &lt;em&gt;Rough and Rowdy Ways&lt;/em&gt; (2020), and reading his new book, &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of Modern Song&lt;/em&gt;, a collection of essays about 66 pop, blues and country tunes, should make abundantly clear. He is rock&amp;rsquo;s world-bending Prospero, in full command of a tempest of his own making, not its rain-soaked Lear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Yet the everyday tragedy of ageing is inescapable in his work. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently something that you can&amp;rsquo;t transcend even if you&amp;rsquo;re a Grammy-hoarding, Academy Award-winning Nobel laureate with a Pulitzer to boot and a body of work that will outlive us all. &amp;ldquo;How can a 17-year-old like me suddenly be 81?&amp;rdquo; the biologist Lewis Wolpert once asked. I wonder if Dylan asks himself this, too. Does he ever catch sight of an elderly gentleman in a dressing gown and a travelling cap in the dark windows of his tour bus and thoroughly dislike what he sees?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Not that it matters very much in the end. &amp;ldquo;Knowing a singer&amp;rsquo;s life story doesn&amp;rsquo;t particularly help your understanding of a song,&amp;rdquo; Dylan writes in his new book, and that&amp;rsquo;s true of a singer&amp;rsquo;s entire body of work, too. A preoccupation with the dying of the light, however, would explain why Dylan has raved with such exhilarating force at close of day, and why he has taken on a hard-bitten, film-noir-gangster-cum-bluesman persona that sticks two fingers up at those who seek autobiographical authenticity in his work, while offending many of his fans with its luridly macho provocations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;This is the misogynistic Dylan who, in a wild exegesis of the Eagles&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Witchy Woman&amp;rdquo;, indulges his fascination for &amp;ldquo;the progressive woman &amp;ndash; youthful, whimsical, and grotesque&amp;rdquo;. He&amp;rsquo;s the American psycho who fantasises about torturing to death a &amp;ldquo;hot-blooded sex starved wench&amp;rdquo;, ventriloquising the protagonist of Elvis Costello&amp;rsquo;s 1978 song &amp;ldquo;Pump It Up&amp;rdquo;. For the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist Jody Rosen, such passages diminish &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; by evoking an image of its author as a reactionary &amp;ldquo;elderly uncle who bulk-emails links to Fox News segments&amp;rdquo;. In the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;, Jude Rogers asks whether Dylan &amp;ldquo;included these rants because he enjoys the idea of staying provocative&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but she understandably finds some of it &amp;ldquo;gut-churning&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Upon first reading, I took all this to be of a piece with the folk- and blues-derived ultraviolence of late-period Dylan songs such as &amp;ldquo;Tin Angel&amp;rdquo;, a story of an adulterous wife that seems modelled equally on the traditional &amp;ldquo;Black Jack Davy&amp;rdquo; and Nick Cave&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Murder Ballads&lt;/em&gt;. For more than a decade now, Dylan has revelled in violence that mostly involves women &amp;ndash; perpetrated by them, inflicted upon them or at least attributed to them in some way. In &amp;ldquo;Nettie Moore&amp;rdquo;, a ballad of regret recorded in 2006, we glimpse Frankie from the folk song &amp;ldquo;Frankie and Albert&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; who murdered her cheating partner in a crime of passion &amp;ndash; merrily &amp;ldquo;raising hell&amp;rdquo;; in the 2000 barnstormer &amp;ldquo;Things Have Changed&amp;rdquo;, a woman with &amp;ldquo;assassin&amp;rsquo;s eyes&amp;rdquo; sits on the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s lap. The femme fatales in his songs are liable to draw first blood and give as good as they get. It&amp;rsquo;s a Robert Johnson-inspired world-view, best summed up by the mournfully sung line &amp;ldquo;There ain&amp;rsquo;t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,&amp;rdquo; from 2001&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Sugar Baby&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As troubling as such sentiments might be, these are genre trappings whose primary function is to elicit a raw emotional response. We&amp;rsquo;re not encouraged to take these lines as gospel, to be agreed with and followed, just as Johnny Cash didn&amp;rsquo;t expect us to go out and shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die. The title of Dylan&amp;rsquo;s new book suggests that his project is to impart a philosophy but it was probably chosen ironically, since anyone familiar with his work knows that its power lies in its irreconcilable contradictions. In his essay on Costello&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Pump It Up&amp;rdquo;, he explains, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s what a song makes you feel about your own life that&amp;rsquo;s important.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s why, I think, his work has always contained multitudes, why very little of it makes the literal, unified sense that compositions by more conventionally wordy songwriters (such as Leonard Cohen) do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;You can, of course, look at it all biographically. In 1978, Dylan recounted in a &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; interview how he had spent his 34th birthday at a gypsy festival in France, where he met the &amp;ldquo;king of the Gypsies&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;d had a heart attack before I&amp;rsquo;d come home to see him. All his wives and children had left . . . They smell death and they leave. That&amp;rsquo;s what happens in life. And I was very affected by seeing that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;So, Dylan has long associated old age with a loss of potency, and his fetishisation of violence might be a cartoonish response to that &amp;ndash; much like in all those action movies about elderly ex-secret agents with a particular set of skills and a barely concealed glee at whooping young butts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Even if that&amp;rsquo;s true, however, there&amp;rsquo;s clearly a lot more going on in both his recent songs and &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. In those lines about the Eagles&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Witchy Woman&amp;rdquo;, he slips on a Maga hat and bemoans &amp;ldquo;the progressive woman&amp;rdquo;, invokes the antisemitic trope of &amp;ldquo;the woman from the global village of nowhere&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; an odd thing to do for a guy who was raised Jewish &amp;ndash; and suggests that the only response is to &amp;ldquo;put on the skin of a lion&amp;rdquo;, echoing Mussolini&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep&amp;rdquo;. A few lines later, however, he describes people who hold such views in the most withering terms: &amp;ldquo;Now you&amp;rsquo;re a self-admiring, unchivalrous fellow with an evil nature.&amp;rdquo; If you nodded along to the woman-hating paranoia, you&amp;rsquo;ll realise pretty soon that the joke&amp;rsquo;s on you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Here is the trickster who threw fictional characters and even Sharon Stone into &lt;em&gt;Rolling Thunder Revue&lt;/em&gt;, his 2019 collaboration with Martin Scorsese that looks like a documentary but is, as its subtitle makes clear, just another &amp;ldquo;Bob Dylan Story&amp;rdquo;. Make of all this what you will, because he offers no unequivocal answers. That, I think, is the point: to make listeners and readers witness the unfolding of their own thought, rather than try to analyse him like an amateur Freud in search of second-hand truths. As he once sang, long ago: trust yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;
