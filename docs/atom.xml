    <title>Call me maybe</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6144/call-me-maybe#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistPhones-lowres.jpg" height="1928" alt="An illustration shows a smart phone next to a dumb phone with conversation spilling out of them" width="1500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My friend Vera likes to send me voice notes. Each one arrives with the innocent ping of an ordinary WhatsApp message. A Trojan Horse, ready to unload its hidden cargo the moment I open it. When I do so, Vera&amp;rsquo;s thoughts tumble out of my phone in a cascade of half-sentences and tangents, an improvised monologue composed entirely for me, wrapped in the background hum of the busy street she is currently walking along. I love these messages and I hate them in roughly equal measure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, WhatsApp announced that users of the messaging app send an average of 7 billion voice notes every single day. The internet is awash with articles proclaiming that the era of the voice note has arrived. &amp;ldquo;How voice memos became the new texts,&amp;rdquo; explained Australia&amp;rsquo;s ABC news in March last year, &amp;ldquo;Third of Gen Z now prefer VOICE NOTES to texts,&amp;rdquo; bellowed MailOnline in October, &amp;ldquo;The hot new thing in tech: speaking into your phone,&amp;rdquo; snarked CNN in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet, for every article proclaiming the brilliance of this new medium, there is another explaining why it should be made immediately extinct. Recent polling by YouGov reflects this unease. Of nearly 2,000 smartphone users, they found that only 16 per cent liked sending voice notes, whilst 36 per cent disliked it. Even among Gen Z, the supposed epicentre of the current voice message boom, half of those polled still said they dislike sending them, compared to 30 per cent who do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How to make sense of our ambivalent feelings towards this nascent phenomenon? For all its much heralded newness, the voice note essentially combines the functionality of two relatively old pieces of telephone technology: the text message (invented in 1992) and the answerphone (invented in 1949). A voice note is a recorded message, like the kind we used to leave on each other&amp;rsquo;s answerphones but now rarely do. Whereas those earlier messages were usually intended as a prelude to a phone conversation, a voice note is the conversation &amp;ndash; like a series of text messages, but burnished with that most tantalising of things, the human voice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Talk with electricity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is no surprise to me that our voices are reinscribing themselves in the ways we choose to communicate with one another. After all, the telephone remains, I believe, one of the great wonders of the modern age &amp;ndash; a device that brings people closer together at the same time as reminding them how far apart they are. Like something from a fairy tale, a telephone call is a granted wish that withholds as much as it gives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As is usually the case in a good fairy tale, the result is happiness forestalled. But then the telephone has always been associated with a kind of longing &amp;ndash; for human contact, if not intimacy. The very first words spoken down a telephone line (by Alexander Graham Bell to his assistant in the neighbouring room) were &amp;ldquo;Mr Watson &amp;ndash; come here &amp;ndash; I want to see you.&amp;rdquo; How many people in the 150 years since then have cried forlornly into their telephone, wishing they could see or touch or be with the person on the other end of the line?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, the intimation of this distance can give a telephone call a closeness that cannot be experienced in any other way. Bell called his invention &amp;ldquo;talk with electricity&amp;rdquo; and anyone who has stayed up too late talking on the phone would surely agree with him. An exchange of love letters might be romantic, but only the telephone really embodies all of love&amp;rsquo;s fervour and its anxiety, all its awkwardness. The headset cradled against your ear. The feeling of being very vulnerable and very excited at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet, by the time the 21st century was in full swing, this wondrous device appeared to be in terminal decline. Who or what killed the telephone call? Was it Drew Barrymore, crying into the phone in terror in the 1996 blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt;, and the deluge of prank calls that followed? Are Apple and Samsung to blame? The first smartphone could be bought in 1994, but only later were these handsets designed primarily as devices for watching, reading, touching and taking photographs, rather than talking. Smartphones today are not actually that convenient for making phone calls, and certainly not as pleasant as a traditional landline phone to hold to your ear for long periods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Quality of connection&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing in the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; in 2015, Ian Bogost claimed that the cause for the decline in telephone calls was the quality of connection. The shift from landlines to mobile phones required the transition from a stable and dependable network of wires to a cellular one that bounced calls erratically through the ether. And whereas a landline compels us to remain indoors, mobile phones enable us to be out in the world where interferences, sonic or otherwise, are manifold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But of course, talking on the phone whilst walking down the street was precisely the thing that made mobile phones so appealing. Suddenly, you could talk on the train, in the park, on a bad date &amp;ndash; even at the movies, as long as you didn&amp;rsquo;t mind the dirty looks. But such pursuit of ease and efficiency is never-ending. More than this, texts and emails enable the author (and the recipient) to retain a greater degree of control over their interaction. What SMS began, internet messaging services like WhatsApp have accelerated. In 2022, roughly 100 billion WhatsApp messages were sent every single day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The voice note might be thought of, then, as a reflection of all we have lost as we drifted away from the phone call. Whilst retaining comfort and convenience, they inject a new kind of intimacy &amp;ndash; something a little more human than a winky face emoji. As with a telephone call, we are speaking with no social cues to guide or reassure us, and none of the shared distractions that cushion our face-to-face conversations &amp;ndash; a coffee to stir, a window to look out of. We cannot compensate for nerves with energy or affection, or try to gauge the mood of the person sitting opposite. There is only our voice. Everything else is stripped away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is lost, however, is spontaneity. In the vacuum of a telephone call, you are required to improvise. You cannot spend hours, or even days, preparing exactly the right wording. A conversation on the telephone can feel like a high-wire act with the safety net removed. And yet we do it together, reaching out our hands and guiding each other through the darkness &amp;ndash; the awkward pauses, the misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Voice notes retain all the potential for misunderstanding and disconnection, but without the shared space to figure our way through. There is too much room to hide, or simply disappear. A telephone call asks something different of us; something we often think we hate, but perhaps we also need. It asks that we keep going &amp;ndash; improvising, listening and being listened to &amp;ndash; until we both know the conversation is over and, with a click, or simply a silence, the line can finally go dead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an edited extract from Andy Field&amp;rsquo;s new book &amp;ldquo;Encounterism&amp;rdquo; (September Publishing), from the summer 2023 issue of New Humanist. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Yes, please: death to the lawn!</title>

&lt;p&gt;Lawns are deserts for living things. Rip &amp;#8217;em up and replace them with diverse species, even the &amp;#8220;weedy&amp;#8221; ones. We&amp;#8217;re trying to evolve our yard away from the boring monoculture, but doing so gradually; Mary has been actively planting a lot of things that are not turf grass, like milkweed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I work at a so-called &amp;#8216;green&amp;#8217; university, which is green in some ways and terribly destructively traditional in other ways. We&amp;#8217;ve got vast empty grassy lawns, which I suppose are great for scenic views of students playing frisbee, but not much else. I recently found out that those nice fields of grass are regularly sprayed with &lt;a href="https://www.siteone.com/pdf/sdsPDF?resourceId=2509"&gt;Q4&lt;/a&gt;, and a few years ago I discovered that we were hosing the shrubbery with an insecticide, specifically to kill the grass spiders that would accidentally end up in the buildings. Could we not? Could we maybe let wild nature take over? We&amp;#8217;ve got some areas planted with native prairie grasses and forbs, and they are freakin&amp;#8217; &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8212; the campus would be so much more attractive if the whole place were covered in exuberant foliage, rather than the stubby boring green stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spiders would be much happier, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;It wasn&amp;#8217;t quite as thrilling/perilous as a D&amp;#038;D dungeon crawl, but we did walk through the steam tunnels beneath campus, and survived.

&lt;p&gt;It is impressive how extensive the tunnels are…and we never really notice them. Apparently we can get to every building on campus without stepping outside, except that most of the access doors are locked for safety reasons: there are asbestos covered pipes everywhere, cables snaking around the ceiling, and hot metal supports that it would be unwise to touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I know how to get into them whenever I want!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Perspectives on the apocalypse</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/07/17/perspectives-on-the-apocalypse/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Émile P. Torres has a provocative perspective on the historical views on <a href="https://xriskology.medium.com/human-extinction-a-brief-guided-tour-of-the-book-5cfb6a5a726">Human Extinction</a>. He breaks it down into five periods of general ideas about the possibility of humanity going extinct, and here they are:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/existential-moods.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/existential-moods-500x235.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="235" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70748" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/existential-moods-500x235.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/existential-moods-150x71.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/existential-moods-300x141.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/existential-moods.jpeg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a><br/>
(1) The ubiquitous assumption that humanity is fundamentally indestructible. This mood dominated from ancient times until the mid-19th century. Throughout most of Western history, nearly everyone would have said that human extinction is impossible, in principle. It just isn’t something that could happen. The result was a reassuring sense of “Comfort” and “perfect security” about humanity’s future, to quote two notable figures writing toward the end of this period. Even if a global catastrophe were to befall our planet, humanity’s survival is ultimately guaranteed by the loving God who created us or the impersonal cosmic order that governs the universe.</p>
<p>(2) The startling realization that our extinction is not only possible in principle but inevitable in the long run — a double trauma that left many wallowing in a state of “unyielding despair,” as the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote in 1903. The heart of this mood was a dual sense of existential vulnerability and cosmic doom: not only are we susceptible to going extinct just like every other species, but the fundamental laws of physics imply that we cannot escape this fate in the coming millions of years. This disheartening mood reverberated for roughly a century, from the 1850s up to the mid-20th century.</p>
<p>(3) The shocking recognition that humanity had created the means to destroy itself quite literally tomorrow. The essence of this mood, which percolated throughout Western societies in the postwar era, was a sense of impending self-annihilation. Throughout the previous mood, almost no one fretted about humanity going extinct anytime soon. Once this new mood descended, fears that we could disappear in the near future became widespread — in newspaper articles, films, scientific declarations, and bestselling books. Some people even chose not to have children because they believed that the end could be near. This mood emerged in 1945 but didn’t solidify until the mid-1950s, when one event in particular led a large number of leading intellectuals to believe that total self-annihilation had become a real possibility in the near term.</p>
<p>(4) The surprising realization that natural phenomena could obliterate humanity in the near term, without much or any prior warning. From at least the 1850s up to the beginning of this mood, scientists almost universally agreed that we live on a very safe planet in a very safe universe — not on an individual level, once again, but on the level of our species. Though humanity might destroy itself, the natural world poses no serious threats to our collective existence, at least not for many millions of years, due to the Second Law of thermodynamics. Nature is on our side. This belief was demolished when scientists realized that, in fact, the natural world is an obstacle course of death traps that will sooner or later try to hurtle us into the eternal grave. Hence, the essence of this mood was a disquieting sense that we are not, in fact, safe.</p>
<p>(5) The most recent existential mood — our current mood — is marked by a disturbing suspicion that however perilous the 20th century was, the 21st century will be even more so. Thanks to climate change, biodiversity loss, the sixth major mass extinction event, and emerging technologies, the worst is yet to come. Evidence of this mood is everywhere: in news headlines declaring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could annihilate humanity, and the apocalyptic rhetoric of environmentalists. As we will discuss more below, surveys of the public show that a majority or near-majority of people in countries like the US believe that extinction this century is quite probable, while many leading intellectuals have expressed the same dire outlook. The threat environment is overflowing with risks, and it appears to be growing more perilous by the year. Can we survive the mess that we’ve created?</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know — it seems to me the big shift was between (1) and (2), and (2) through (5) and more subtle distinctions about how and when the species is going to die. He also argues that these transitions are fairly sharp and clear, but really, Alvarez ended the uniformitarian hypothesis? I don’t think so. But then, I haven’t read his book yet.</p>
<p>Also, just to complicate things, there are a lot of people today who are stuck in the (1) mindset. He gives one horrifying example, of a man who got elected to the American presidency.</p>
<blockquote><p>As I write in the book, end-times prophesies are both rigid and highly elastic, often able to accommodate unforeseen developments as if the Bible predicted them all along. Ronald Reagan provides an example. In 1971, while he was governor of California, he declared that,</p>
<blockquote class="creationist">
<p>for the first time ever, everything is in place for the battle of Armageddon and the Second Coming of Christ. … It can’t be long now. Ezekiel [38:22] says that fire and brimstone will be rained upon the enemies of God’s people. That must mean that they’ll be destroyed by nuclear weapons. They exist now, and they never did in the past.</p>

<p>For Reagan and other evangelicals, the possibility of a nuclear holocaust was filtered through the lens of a religious hermeneutics. Consequently, their mapping of the threat environment was completely different than the mapping of atheists like Carl Sagan and Bertrand Russell. The latter two did not see nuclear weapons as part of God’s grand plan to defeat evil. Rather, a thermonuclear Armageddon would simply be the last, pitiful paragraph of our species’ autobiography. Whereas for Christians, the other side of the apocalypse is paradise, for atheistic individuals it is nothing but oblivion. In this way, secularization played an integral part in enabling the discovery and creation of new kill mechanisms to alter the threat environment and, with these alterations, to induce shifts from one existential mood to another.</p></blockquote>
<p>Man, Reagan was a batshit lunatic fuck, wasn’t he? And he thought a nuclear holocaust would be a <em>good</em> thing. When Torres says <em>our</em> current mood, that has to be interpreted as a rather narrow “our” because I think a scary huge percentage of the public don’t share that mood with us.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Wooden shamanic totems in Siberia. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/shamanism-sq.jpg" height="1368" alt="Wooden shamanic totem poles in Siberia" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rhonda McCrimmon, from Dundee, has 180,000 TikTok followers. Some of them are doctors, others are teachers, lecturers or social workers. They are all looking for spiritual guidance. McCrimmon is a self-styled Shaman, and posts videos on connecting with spirit guides, power animals and cauldron healing. &amp;ldquo;One of the beautiful things about Shamanism is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from anywhere,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;It just is, and has existed for as long as anybody knows. It is not exclusive to one culture or ethnicity.&amp;rdquo; She is popular, with more than 1.5 million TikTok likes, and expensive too &amp;ndash; charging clients &amp;pound;3,500 for Shamanic practitioner courses lasting 20 months. Yet a growing body of opinion would question whether she knows what she is talking about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Shamanism has drawn attention, attracting celebrity followers including Jennifer Lawrence and Daniel Craig. In November, Princess Martha of Norway quit royal duties to focus on a Shamanic healing business with her Shaman fianc&amp;eacute;. And this interest is set to increase, if the 2021 UK census is a benchmark. It showed that over the past decade, there has been a 12-fold increase in British people stating their religion as Shamanism, from 650 in 2011 to 8,000 in 2021. Notably, this did not involve ticking a box, but writing their religion into a free-text space. Other nature-based religions also grew, but did not get the same traction. Paganism, which has European roots, increased its adherents by a quarter. The number of Wiccans grew by nearly 8 per cent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behind the headlines, however, Shamanism&amp;rsquo;s complex origins are surprising and rarely understood. Dr Susannah Crockford is a senior lecturer in anthropology at the University of Exeter. She says that the word &amp;ldquo;Shaman&amp;rdquo; originated with the Tungusic people of Siberia and referred to that community&amp;rsquo;s Indigenous spiritual practitioners. When the Russian conquest of Siberia occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries, Europeans returned to their homelands with stories of Shamans. &amp;ldquo;But in a very racist fashion, they laughed at them,&amp;rdquo; says Crockford. &amp;ldquo;The image of the Shaman became known in European literary circles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the 20th century, and European anthropologists were observing and writing about other cultures. On seeing Indigenous spiritual practitioners in other parts of the world, they labelled them all &amp;ldquo;Shamans&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;They used this word to describe spiritual practitioners across North America, South America and south-east Asia,&amp;rdquo; Crockford says. &amp;ldquo;None of these people used the word Shaman themselves, it was a colonial imposition on global practices that had Indigenous names. That is why you will find a broad diversity of practices under this label &amp;lsquo;Shamanism&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The bibles of western Shamanism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For western Shamans, Indigenous spiritual practices from around the world have been conveniently &amp;ndash; and questionably &amp;ndash; condensed into two books that serve as the bibles for their beliefs. In 1964, the Romanian historian Mircea Eliade published Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy. Differing Indigenous spiritual practices were merged in this book, yet it developed a following in 1960s America. It was another book, however, which became the blueprint for Shamanic practice in western societies. In 1980, the American anthropologist Michael Harner published The Way of the Shaman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Harner translated the Indigenous religions as he understood them, and then mashed them together,&amp;rdquo; says James L. Cox, emeritus professor of religions at the University of Edinburgh, who has a specialist research interest in Indigenous religions. &amp;ldquo;Harner turned Indigenous practices &amp;ndash; which tended to be about solving community problems, for example, a lack of rain or another person&amp;rsquo;s illness &amp;ndash; into an individualistic practice. In this western 1980s version of Shamanism, you could go to a weekend workshop and discuss your personal problems . . . It is a form of modern therapy where you discuss yourself in a group.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harner describes &amp;ldquo;trance&amp;rdquo; as key to unlocking the insights of western Shamanism. In this altered state, the individual is alert but experiences ecstasy through drumming, rattling, dancing and singing &amp;ldquo;power songs&amp;rdquo;. Later on in the book, readers are guided to communicate with rocks to solve their life problems: by picking up a big stone, asking it a question, and then watching it for visions. According to Harner Shamans in the west can also find their personal &amp;ldquo;power animal&amp;rdquo; by shaking a rattle and dancing like an animal of their choice. He writes that Shamans should &amp;ldquo;experience the emotions of the animal, and don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to make the cries or noises of it, if you experience the desire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book relies heavily on detailing the practices of North American and Amazonian tribes. In the opening, Harner recognises this, but adds that those who follow the techniques will not be simply &amp;ldquo;playing Indian&amp;rdquo;, but having the same &amp;ldquo;revelatory&amp;rdquo; experience, based on &amp;ldquo;methods learnt from South and North American Indians&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shannon O&amp;rsquo;Loughlin is a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, in the United States, and CEO of the Association on American Indian Affairs. &amp;ldquo;Shamanism itself is a colonial word. It is a misrepresentation and appropriation of Indigenous world views,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;The taking of Native ceremonies and using them for commercial or ego-driven practices is harmful to Native Nations, and to those non-Native persons using them without consent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Power animals and lunar energies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Karen Ward disagrees that her Shamanic practice culturally appropriates. She is a doctor of philosophy at Dublin City University, a psychotherapist, and identifies as an Irish Celtic Shaman. &amp;ldquo;If you can trace your lineage to something then you&amp;rsquo;re not appropriating,&amp;rdquo; she says, adding that &amp;ldquo;people should namecheck the traditions they use&amp;rdquo; in order to acknowledge their origins. &amp;ldquo;For me, Celtic Shamanism can be practised by going to Stonehenge on winter solstice, working with lunar energies, or by sitting in a circle &amp;ndash; where there is no priest or hierarchy &amp;ndash; and connecting with each other, and really listening to one another, giving another person in my circle that time. My ancestors would have done these things, I can trace my lineage back to all these traditions and not appropriate other cultures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there is little evidence of such ancient European practices, according to both Professor Cox and Dr Crockford. &amp;ldquo;People will call themselves Celtic Shamans,&amp;rdquo; says Crockford. &amp;ldquo;But it is very sketchy archaeologically and historically. We do not know that Druids existed, let alone their spiritual beliefs. So to reconstruct this as an ancient religion is an imaginative process. A lot of the practices that you will find in Celtic Shaman circles are strikingly like those detailed in Eliade and Harner&amp;rsquo;s books.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crockford notes that spirituality has taken off on social media. WitchTok is a spiritual community on TikTok that has received billions of views. &amp;ldquo;Just look at WitchTok,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Combined with the celebrity influence, it has become trendy. Those charging for Shamanism courses are like influencers. They are on the same channels &amp;ndash; YouTube, Instagram, TikTok. They will get money from ad revenue, and sell spiritual readings over Zoom and Facebook groups. Look at who takes these [courses] and who is making money, though. You cannot help but notice, it is usually white, English-speaking, middle- or upper-class people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Loughlin adds that name-checking is not enough. &amp;ldquo;Simply naming, &amp;lsquo;I have stolen this from Native Peoples&amp;rsquo; does not resolve or mitigate the harm,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Alleged traditional teachings from books, websites or from non-Native Peoples are simply not authentic. The value of these ceremonies is questionable and meaningless. Instead of practising &amp;lsquo;Shamanism&amp;rsquo;, start living minimally. Respect, and stop appropriating &amp;ndash; especially for profit &amp;ndash; from other cultures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Life is Hard by Kieran Setiya</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6139/book-review-life-is-hard-by-kieran-setiya#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/life-is-hard.jpg" height="499" alt="The cover of 'Life is Hard' has an illustration of a hummingbird and a thistle" width="312"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life is Hard: How Philosophy Can Help Us Find Our Way&lt;/strong&gt; (Hutchinson Heinemann) by Kieran Setiya&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kieran Setiya is an accomplished analytic philosopher and, increasingly, one of the finest public philosophers working today. His latest book, &lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt;, was written during the pandemic and its title certainly captures the present mood. But Setiya doesn&amp;rsquo;t just mean that life is hard now. After all, haven&amp;rsquo;t infirmity, grief and injustice always been with us, and won&amp;rsquo;t they remain so? Setiya&amp;rsquo;s focus is on the core features of life that make it seemingly inevitably hard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is a rich and rewarding read, reckoning with everything from personal failure to the meaning of life. The philosophy is fed by examples from Setiya&amp;rsquo;s life: his teenage heartbreak, the onset in his twenties of chronic and excruciating pelvic pain, his mother&amp;rsquo;s Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease, his involvement in climate activism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setiya is surely right that there are hardships that almost all lives will face, sooner or later; such is the human condition. His aim is to help us in &amp;ldquo;making the best of a bad lot&amp;rdquo;. He examines the ingredients that make life hard one by one, but what emerges is a view of life as a whole: humanistic, rooted in our social nature, and notably influenced by the novelist and philosopher Iris Murdoch. And if you have a stereotype of the philosophy professor as coldly rationalistic, then the centrality that Setiya gives to love might surprise you. &amp;ldquo;We are made for love,&amp;rdquo; he writes, &amp;ldquo;and we are lost without it.&amp;rdquo; Personally, I most often found his remarks to be moving and true. Some, perhaps, might find the book overly sentimental.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt; reveals the benefits of bringing careful analysis to the problems of life, but it also shows that this kind of philosophy calls for emotional intelligence. What it offers, ultimately, is consolation by acknowledgement. Setiya doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to magic away the problem of grief, for example, as the Stoic philosopher Epictetus did. Rather, he gives us words to understand our grief better, and so perhaps helps us live with the reality of love and loss. He supports this perspective throughout with a wonderful diversity of sources from literature, social science, psychology and history &amp;ndash; from the Bhagavad Gita to Gerrard Winstanley to Annie Ernaux.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discussion of failure is particularly illuminating. Setiya seeks to demonstrate how philosophy can liberate us, by showing that it&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to think of our lives in terms of one big narrative, at the end of which we&amp;rsquo;re either &amp;ldquo;winners&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;losers&amp;rdquo;. He also highlights the social forces that encourage us to think this way. Indeed, he shows how we must move beyond the logic of the self-help genre, by insisting on the social source of our problems and, where possible, their social remedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is why Setiya looks outward as well as inward, in part because when you look inward what you discover is how the world out there has made you. Perhaps the book&amp;rsquo;s vision is most inspiring and ambitious when he argues that the meaning of life itself is ultimately a political issue. &lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt; makes a compelling case that whether human life is meaningful depends on whether we give it meaning by collectively striving towards justice for humanity as a whole. Here, unlike in the case of our individual life stories, Setiya encourages us to think of the human story in terms of a grand narrative. He acknowledges the similarities with those great German philosophers Hegel and Marx, but unlike them he doesn&amp;rsquo;t see any historical destination as inevitable. It all depends on whether we get our act together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt; is a weighty and satisfying book. Some people might find it a little too earnest, even with Setiya&amp;rsquo;s likeable sense of humour. The seriousness feels so mandatory that it is tempting to rebel against it. Life is hard, the title tells us, and Setiya offers no superficial escapes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How neo-Nazis are radicalising gamers</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6137/how-neo-nazis-are-radicalising-gamers#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Graphics from 'Assassin's Creed: Valhalla'" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/valhalla.jpg" height="540" alt="A graphic from Assassin's Creed: Valhalla shows a Viking-esque warrior walking through a battlefield carrying an axe" width="960"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might seem contradictory that the most hateful viewpoints are often coupled with a yearning for a return to a romantic, idyllic past. In order for any political movement to survive, its leaders have to tell stories about how they think the world should be. On the far right, it usually goes as follows: our lands were once places of unspoiled, awe-inspiring natural beauty. People lived materially tough but spiritually enriching lives, graced with pristine, entirely white, nuclear families, green spaces and physical and psychological strength. The only thing they had to do to protect their way of life was to defend themselves &amp;ndash; unfailingly, violently &amp;ndash; against outsiders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if there isn&amp;rsquo;t a period of history that backs up that narrative, you can just invent one. A prime example of this is the far right&amp;rsquo;s celebration of the Vikings &amp;ndash; inaccurately re-envisioned as a singular white race built on glory and bloodshed, with a visually striking and fearsome aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Nazi party repeatedly adopted Viking and Nordic symbols to craft a fantasy of the Aryan race; the swastika is based on an ancient, Nordic artefact. As alt-right politics rose to the surface of party politics following the election of Donald Trump to the presidency, Norse-age symbols and &amp;ldquo;alt-history&amp;rdquo; also began to reappear. A year later, at the Unite the Right Rally, organised by Richard Spencer, protestors could be seen carrying Thor&amp;rsquo;s hammer as they marched through the streets of Charlottesville &amp;ndash; an event that led to the murder of Heather Heyer, after a participant deliberately drove their car into a crowd of counter-protestors. The Viking helmets seen in the Capitol riots in 2021 were also part of the far right&amp;rsquo;s perversion of Norse folklore and paganism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around this time, extremism researchers were also becoming concerned with the gaming community, which seemed to be increasingly overrun by violent, extremist imagery and propaganda. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t incidental. When the former Trump strategist Steve Bannon took over US far-right outlet Breitbart, he used his position to encourage Gamergate: an organised, misogynistic online harassment campaign directed against feminist gamers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recent research from the Global Network of Extremism and Technology (GNET) looks at the weaponisation by the far right of two video games in particular: &lt;em&gt;Assassins Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;. Both are based on an alt-history in which gamers can play out their white supremacist fantasies. &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is rooted in Greek and Norse mythology and has been frequently criticised for graphic scenes of violence and portrayals of toxic masculinity. Artwork from &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; has also been adopted by recognised white supremacist groups and shared online. The study shows how these hyper-real, reconstructed versions of history were adopted by fascists and scattered across the digital space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even before the release of &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed [Valhalla]&lt;/em&gt;, the game&amp;rsquo;s developers knew it would be used by white supremacists. There was a tonne of pre-warning press saying that they were trying to avoid the game being manipulated by Nazis. The argument you could make, though, is that they have still created this extremely sensationalised version of Vikings which isn&amp;rsquo;t accurate,&amp;rdquo; Dr Ashton Kingdon, a teaching fellow in criminology at the University of Southampton, who authored the report, tells me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Historical fantasies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; was launched in 2020 as the 12th instalment of the Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed series. It had the biggest launch to date, selling most of its copy within its first week. It is games developer Ubisoft&amp;rsquo;s second most profitable venture, gaining over $1 billion in revenue in 2022. Santa Monica Studio&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is a franchise that was originally based on Greek mythology. However, with its 2018 series, the developers decided to incorporate Norse mythology. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to overestimate the popularity of both games. Despite &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s mixed reviews, the game built up a fan base of 20 million players in just two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story of &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; centres on Eivor, whom the player can cast as male or female, and their brother Sigurd. It&amp;rsquo;s 873 CE. The siblings&amp;rsquo; backstory is told at the start of the game, over speeding visuals of a luminous, misty forest, as they recount witnessing their parents&amp;rsquo; murder before their eyes. From there, they take to England &amp;ndash; a land already populated with Danes and Norse after years of battle. The task is to gather allies and recruit new soldiers to defend the &amp;ldquo;homeland&amp;rdquo; against England&amp;rsquo;s begrudged four kingdoms: Mercia, East Anglia, Northumbria and Wessex. Players siege castles, set thatched huts alight and generally raid and massacre their way to glory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an immersive, cinematic game, full of expansive scenes of rolling green hills in Dark Age England. You can also wander through the mountainous terrains of Vinland, an area first discovered by Leif Erikson in 1000 CE, five centuries before Columbus. It&amp;rsquo;s not all killing and pillaging, either. The game throws you into some emotionally testing scenarios. You find yourself ushered into making swift, life-ending decisions over suspected traitors, or unearthing the motivations behind a man who is haunted by the spirit of his dead wife. For some relief, you can sing songs or partake in a drinking game or two.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The attention to detail and artistry are impressive, and the romanticisation might not seem immediately harmful. But when it falls into the wrong hands, an intricate, highly realistic rendition of Viking mythology sends a worrying message. One of the main gripes for historians is the overarching use of the term &amp;ldquo;Viking&amp;rdquo; itself. The idea of the blue-eyed, blonde-haired warrior conquering Europe just isn&amp;rsquo;t true. Viking, Kingdon explains, is actually a verb, alluding to the group&amp;rsquo;s activities. The seafarers settled across the Mediterranean, Caspian, Black, Arctic and North Atlantic seas. They could be distinguishable from Celts or Saxons not because of their ethnicity, but because of their skill in sailing. It was only in the 19th century, when Europe was becoming increasingly nationalistic, that the myth that the Vikings were a superior race &amp;ndash; descended from a genetically pure bloodline &amp;ndash; began to take hold of the popular psyche.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The imaginary locations shown in &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; tap into the insidious idea of &amp;ldquo;the hyperborea.&amp;rdquo; As Abbie Richards, an extremism researcher, succinctly puts it in a video explainer: &amp;ldquo;Hyperborea was this ancient, high civilisation where the Aryan race &amp;ndash; white people &amp;ndash; lived in paradise before they were forced to mix with other races. It&amp;rsquo;s a racist fairytale used to perpetuate white supremacy and to justify racist violence. This stuff is racist and antisemitic but also coded enough that people just engage with it like it&amp;rsquo;s just a story.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The term is rooted in esoteric Nazism, what Richards describes as &amp;ldquo;white supremacy disguised as a web of metaphysical and mystical nonsense. This flavour of Nazism is obsessed with the mythical Aryan race and restoring it [even though] it was never a thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Violence and video games&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, should we worry about these games and others like them? Not necessarily, but it&amp;rsquo;s a difficult line to toe. Researchers have emphasised that it&amp;rsquo;s not about the games themselves as much as how they are used. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing that&amp;rsquo;s inherent in video games that leads people towards extremist views or actions, nor is it the case that the violence within gaming &amp;ndash; or any other medium, like horror films or music &amp;ndash; will act as a form of radicalisation. In 2020, reanalysis of often-cited 2008 research from the American Psychological Association rebuffed claims that video games lead to an increase in aggressive behaviour. On the contrary, after reviewing 28 papers, the Royal Society for Open Science proposed that video games could have a positive impact on cognition and self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moral panics surrounding video games do not help to answer the complex question of why some people commit unthinkable acts. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of pseudo-psychology that sweeps aside structural issues, like regulation in technology and mental health care. By robbing people of their agency, it fails to hold the powerful to account. The National Rifle Association regularly blames video games for mass shootings to deflect from conversations on gun control. Following the shooting in Parkland, Florida in 2018, Trump said that &amp;ldquo;we have to do something ... I&amp;rsquo;m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people&amp;rsquo;s thoughts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would it be possible for an ordinary person without any particularly strong political leanings to spend hours playing &lt;em&gt;Assassins Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and emerge as a neo-Nazi? Kingdon doesn&amp;rsquo;t think so. &amp;ldquo;No, I think it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous to blame the games themselves for radicalisation. Video games themselves don&amp;rsquo;t create terrorists because the narratives in these games are not extreme. It&amp;rsquo;s more about the way they&amp;rsquo;ve been manipulated and weaponised as propaganda,&amp;rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Meme wars&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To really understand radicalisation in technology, we need to understand online subcultures and communities. Gaming has historically been seen as a space for men; games are marketed towards men, and have a history of casual misogyny. Female gamers, journalists and developers are often seen as intruders in this space and are targeted accordingly. At the start of Gamergate in 2014, feminists in gaming seeking better representation in storylines and the industry itself faced an onslaught of online abuse and threats. It is now widely acknowledged that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just organic. White supremacist groups used Gamergate as a political recruiting tool. Steve Bannon described how he was able to identify gamers as &amp;ldquo;These guys, these rootless white males [who] had monster power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As alt-right figures used Gamergate to drum up support for Trump in online, misogynistic spaces, the neo-pagan, hypermasculine figures in alternative history video games have captured the same fan base. While there are plenty of women playing video games they are often still seen as unserious consumers of more violent games marketed to men. In 2022, the Bryter annual gamers study found that an increasing number of women were playing video games, but that 72 per cent of them had experienced some form of harassment, with 36 per cent of them experiencing it regularly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might seem impossible to understand why anyone in society today would be drawn to the same Aryan race myths deployed in propaganda nearly a century ago. But many right-wing groups are adept at understanding and manipulating the language and imagery that young people, or at least some young people, can relate to. &amp;ldquo;The alt right knows that it won&amp;rsquo;t ever be able to get power in the ballot box. The only way they can attempt to gain influence is by shifting things culturally. They use images and symbols not just in games, but in meme culture too,&amp;rdquo; says Kingdon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In her book &lt;em&gt;Meme Wars: The Untold Story of the Online Battles&lt;/em&gt;, Joan Donovan describes how the right were able to capture audiences by offering simple, emotive images and slogans designed to be repeated and reshared across the internet: &amp;ldquo;Meme wars are culture wars, accelerated and intensified because of the infrastructure and incentives of the internet, which trades outrage and extremity as currency, rewards speed and scale, and flattens the experience of the world into a never-ending scroll of images and words, a morass capable of swallowing patience, kindness and understanding.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, too, went through what researchers would describe as a form of memification. By taking screenshots and images from games like these and reposting them online as memes, extremists are able to instruct recruits on how they should be consumed and interpreted. GNET&amp;rsquo;s research points out that in 2018, an Italian far-right activist, Luca Triani, carried out a drive-by shooting in Marceta, where he injured five men and one woman of African origin. Triani was draped in an Italian flag and shouting &amp;ldquo;Viva l&amp;rsquo;Italia.&amp;rdquo; The shooting is thought to have acted as a motivation for the Christchurch attacks in 2019. Triani may have been acting alone, but he was not a &amp;ldquo;lone wolf&amp;rdquo;. The attack came a month before Italy&amp;rsquo;s general election, with parties of almost all political stripes blaming immigrants for frictions in society and a weakened economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His actions also had repercussions in a section of the gaming community, where he became a symbol around which the far right could rally. On Gab, a tech platform popular with social media users on the far right, a widely circulated meme shows Triani portrayed as the leading character in &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, known as Kratos. It was first posted shortly after the attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Not Viking enough'&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s only a small number of people operating in gaming that are locked into these highly distorted views of society. But when these views do appear, they are as deliberately grotesque as possible. A cursory look on Reddit, which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend for anyone&amp;rsquo;s sanity, reveals users complaining that &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s developers Ubisoft have caved in to external pressure and become &amp;ldquo;too woke&amp;rdquo;. The most pressing concern on the thread is that there is no opportunity to rape anyone in the game, which didn&amp;rsquo;t make it &amp;ldquo;Viking&amp;rdquo; enough &amp;ndash; a complaint that&amp;rsquo;s been repeated on several forums. (It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that no popular video game, including &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, offers this function.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to police some of the behaviour in online gaming communities as so much of it is steeped in irony and humour. There&amp;rsquo;s no way of being able to tell if someone sharing a meme or even stating something vulgar or offensive is planning a terrorist act, or even if they believe in what they&amp;rsquo;re saying in any sense. Sometimes, a meme with deeply hidden connotations with the far right has been repeated so many times that it is stripped of its meaning and appears as a simple joke. Even the most advanced of analysts are usually unable to pinpoint someone&amp;rsquo;s motivations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean nothing can be done. TikTok banned the term &amp;ldquo;hyperborea&amp;rdquo; from its search function after fake videos claiming to show forgotten, hidden snow civilisations received millions of views. That won&amp;rsquo;t stop TikTok users who are so inclined to find alternative ways of posting esoteric Nazi content through using similar hashtags, but it at least shows that those holding the reins in big tech are aware of these far-right dog whistles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been attempts within the gaming community to tackle toxic attitudes through broader representation in storylines. &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, for example, includes a female protagonist, while &lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnar&amp;ouml;k&lt;/em&gt;, launched in 2021, has also included Black, female characters. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell, however, how cynical these inclusions may turn out to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While developers may protest that no one can know how any fictional work will be used and adapted, this can also be argued as a reason to be more cautious. The GNET research showed that the developers of &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; were aware that the games risked indulging the far right. And yet they still gave their players storylines that recycled dangerous prejudices. Meanwhile, Ubisoft made over $2 billion in revenue in 2022 alone. In an increasingly right-wing political landscape, games developers and technology companies making extortionate profits can afford to tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here for access to the full magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Church in crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6142/the-church-in-crisis#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="St Lawrence's church in Castle Rising, Norfolk. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/rodell1.jpg" height="913" alt="St Lawrence's church in Castle Rising, Norfolk" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By all accounts, Philip North is a very nice man. In fact, the Church of England, which appointed him as Bishop of Blackburn in January 2022, contains a lot of decent, well-meaning people. Unfortunately many of them are rather upset, because Philip North is opposed to the ordination of women priests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apparently he does not object to women having authority over men, and has no problem working with women priests. But he does not think the Church of England should unilaterally take decisions which should be made together with the Roman Catholic, Orthodox and other Anglican churches. This is 30 years after the Church first accepted women priests, and seven years after it appointed its first female bishop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just after North&amp;rsquo;s appointment came the recommendations from a five-year study by Church of England bishops, supported by its General Synod after an emotional debate, that the Church should continue to deny church marriages to same-sex couples, but instead &amp;ldquo;lament and repent of the failure&amp;hellip; to be welcoming to LGBTQI+ people&amp;rdquo; and provide &amp;ldquo;prayers of thanksgiving, dedication and for God&amp;rsquo;s blessing&amp;rdquo; for same-sex couples married in civil ceremonies. At the same time, they voted to reaffirm the doctrine that marriage is only between a man and a woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also leads the global Anglican Communion, where &amp;ldquo;The average Anglican is a woman in sub-Saharan Africa in her thirties&amp;rdquo;. Anglican churches in the global south are vehemently opposed to same-sex marriage. He avoided a schism at the Communion&amp;rsquo;s 2022 Lambeth Conference by persuading delegates to agree to disagree, while reaffirming a 1998 statement &amp;ldquo;rejecting homosexual practice as incompatible with Scripture&amp;rdquo;. After the Synod&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;blessings&amp;rdquo; decision, he said he would not be giving any personally, and made emollient remarks to African bishops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was not enough. The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches, which represents 10 of the 42 provinces in the Anglican Communion, responded by withdrawing its recognition of Justin Welby as the Communion&amp;rsquo;s leader, stating that the Church of England was &amp;ldquo;disqualified&amp;rdquo; as their historic &amp;ldquo;Mother Church&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the problem will not go away within the Church of England itself. &amp;ldquo;We love and bless you, but your relationships are second class&amp;rdquo; is not a sustainable message.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are not the only ethical challenges facing the Church. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse reported in 2020 that it had failed to protect children. More abuse revelations surfaced in 2022. It also has an ethnic issue. According to Mike Royal, the Pentecostal head of Churches Together in England: &amp;ldquo;Urban Anglican Churches depend on black membership for their backbone.&amp;rdquo; Yet a report on the General Synod early in 2022 was headed: &amp;ldquo;Lord Boateng holds Synod&amp;rsquo;s feet to the fire over Church&amp;rsquo;s racism record.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A cliff edge&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may think, &amp;ldquo;So what if the Church ties itself in knots?&amp;rdquo; But these are symptoms of a bigger underlying issue which affects us all. To understand it, we need to look behind the &amp;ldquo;Less than half of England and Wales population identifies as Christian&amp;rdquo; headlines which accompanied the 2021 Census results. The Census is unrivalled when it comes to local detail, but provides no analysis of &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo;. Fortunately we have the British Social Attitudes Survey (BSAS), which asks a more refined question about religious belonging, and provides a denominational breakdown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What it tells us is that Anglican identity is falling off a cliff. In the mid-1980s, around two in five British adults considered themselves Anglican. Now, half of British adults have no religious identity. Of the 40 per cent identifying as Christian, only a third are Anglicans. Around a fifth are Catholics, with the rest a mix of declining Nonconformist churches, and growing Orthodox, Pentecostal and smaller denominations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the face of it, the Church has massive potential influence over the country&amp;rsquo;s young people. It controls a quarter of England&amp;rsquo;s state-funded primary schools, and some secondaries. Often they have faith-based admission criteria, and in many places the Church primary school is the only practical option for parents. A few years ago, the then chair of the Church&amp;rsquo;s board of education, John Pritchard, called for clergy to be trained to use its schools to extend the Church&amp;rsquo;s mission: &amp;ldquo;The clergy ought to have a camp bed in there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it is not working. The main driver of decline is not Anglicans leaving, but children of Anglicans not carrying on with the faith. While a third of people aged 75 and over identify with the Church, only one in a hundred under-25s do. One per cent. English Anglicanism is literally dying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at practice rather than identity, the mathematician John Hayward applied the &amp;ldquo;R number&amp;rdquo; methodology familiar from Covid-19 to church attendance data, and concluded that the Church of England would become extinct around 2060. The response from Stephen Cottrell, the Archbishop of York, was that &amp;ldquo;the church of Jesus Christ is not an organisation that lives or dies by graphs going up and down&amp;rdquo;. This is the man who, in 2021, proposed a new growth strategy involving the establishment of 10,000 new lay-led churches over 10 years &amp;ndash; around three a day &amp;ndash; a plan which led Canon Angela Tilby to wonder whether &amp;ldquo;in a desperate attempt to avoid facing&amp;hellip; reality, we have entered a state of corporate psychosis: a leap into false consciousness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Speaking in tongues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As well as shrinking, the Church is changing. For some time, it has been moving in an evangelical, and especially &amp;ldquo;charismatic&amp;rdquo; direction: the form of Christianity featuring personal experiences of the Holy Spirt, healing miracles, and speaking in tongues, a practice which Justin Welby says he began aged 19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A key vehicle has been the Alpha Course, which began at the &amp;ndash; very posh &amp;ndash; Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) Anglican Church in Kensington. It spread rapidly in the 1990s across the Church of England, and to other denominations and other countries, promising &amp;ldquo;an opportunity to explore the meaning of life&amp;rdquo;. HTB is now a major force in the Church, with nearly 100 churches in its network. But it has not stemmed the Church&amp;rsquo;s overall decline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand this decline, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to make a distinction between &amp;ldquo;societal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;congregational&amp;rdquo; religion. In the past, the Church of England was &amp;ldquo;societal&amp;rdquo;: some people went to services, others just on special occasions. But most people felt they somehow belonged. That no longer applies. Evangelical Anglicanism is &amp;ldquo;congregational&amp;rdquo;. Its members are aware that many others think some of their practices bizarre, or their views strange. But they&amp;rsquo;ve come to Jesus, and face a sinful world together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet, as we shall see, there are reasons why this smaller, increasingly evangelical, less &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; and more female entity will not simply take its place among others as it sinks into our diverse religion and belief landscape. The Church&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;established&amp;rdquo; status is under increasing pressure, both because of its decline and because of its position on same-sex marriage. Yet Justin Welby still wants to keep the privileges that establishment brings, including 26 bishops in the House of Lords.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is not alone in wanting the Church to remain a part of the state. According to Bristol University&amp;rsquo;s Tariq Modood, minority faiths also like this arrangement, in the belief that it provides a &amp;ldquo;canopy&amp;rdquo; of respect for all people of religious faith. It may go further than respect. There was some discussion, after Queen Elizabeth II&amp;rsquo;s death, as to whether our new monarch should retain the role of Supreme Governor of the Church of England (see Andrew Copson in the Winter 2022 issue of New Humanist). Among the minority voices who spoke in favour of King Charles III&amp;rsquo;s taking on the &amp;ldquo;Defender of the Faith&amp;rdquo; title was (Lord) Daniel Finkelstein, who expressed his belief that the role did more than protect the Anglican community. &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;as a Jew I feel I cannot be fully secure in respect for my own religion unless assurance is given by someone secure in what they themselves believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a recent survey for the think-tank Theos, a third of all non-religious people in the UK agreed that &amp;ldquo;Religion is comparable to the smallpox virus, but harder to eradicate&amp;rdquo; (it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t account for a third of all humanists.) That sounds like &amp;ldquo;contempt for all religion&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; although, importantly, it does not mean &amp;ldquo;contempt for all religious people&amp;rdquo;. Meanwhile, there is no evidence that the established Church does anything to protect against antisemitism, or anti-Muslim prejudice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clearly we must be careful not to allow an uncomprehending religious/non-religious divide to damage the country. The end of establishment for the Church of England, when it comes, might usefully be accompanied by a reassurance that human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, remain protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Financial atonement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also the finances to consider. We still have 16,000 Anglican church buildings, nearly 80 per cent of them &amp;ldquo;listed&amp;rdquo; by Historic England, many with small congregations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Operating and maintaining old buildings takes a lot of money. Fortunately, the Church has plenty of it. Unlike a company, with a Chief Executive and an annual report, the Church&amp;rsquo;s finances are complex. In 2016, Ed Moore, then Treasurer of the National Secular Society, attempted to estimate its total wealth. He came up with over &amp;pound;22 billion. Today, Church Commissioners manage &amp;pound;10 billion in assets, in addition to the &amp;pound;5 billion or so held by the 42 dioceses. Over the past 30 years, the Commissioners claim their average return has been an impressive 10 per cent. All of this is tax free (see Emma Park on page 42).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a purely financial viewpoint, then, the Church Commissioners could carry on indefinitely. Meanwhile, its diminishing band of parishioners manage to raise &amp;pound;1 billion each year, but say they are desperately starved of funds. Although the Commissioners have recently increased their funding for the Church&amp;rsquo;s operations, Justin Welby says the purpose is to provide &amp;ldquo;support for mission so every person might hear the Good News of Jesus Christ&amp;hellip; [and] support our aims to double the number of children and young disciples by 2030&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reaction from parish level was therefore predictable when the Church announced it would spend &amp;pound;100 million to atone for the fact that some of its wealth &amp;ndash; equivalent to &amp;pound;1.4 billion in today&amp;rsquo;s money according to one calculation &amp;ndash; can be traced back to investments in slavery in the 18th century. The money would go on a &amp;ldquo;programme of investment, research and engagement&amp;rdquo; including funding to support &amp;ldquo;communities affected by historic slavery&amp;rdquo;. Nothing wrong with that, of course. But Rev Marcus Walker, chairman of Save The Parish, was understandably upset: &amp;ldquo;After decades of telling us that there is no money to fund the churches and priests who keep the church alive on the front line, suddenly they&amp;rsquo;ve found &amp;pound;100 million behind the back of the sofa.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no easy solutions to the problem of large numbers of listed buildings little used for their original purpose as places of worship. But a diminished Church cannot expect to protect a legacy of enormous wealth and tax-exempt investments, while at the same time starving its parishes and relying on charities, with a bit of government support, to conserve its estate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One beneficial use is as a base for local social action, of which the Church is rightly proud. Yes, plenty of non-religious people make important contributions here, as do non-Christian faith groups. But the Church has a physical presence in a lot more places, providing the infrastructure for foodbanks, playgroups and places to go in emergencies. As the traditional model of churches and vicars becomes increasingly unsustainable, new solutions will be needed to keep the social action baby while the Anglican bathwater flows away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hollowed out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the time being at least, the Church retains a carapace of a great national institution: massive wealth; still-significant power; a substantial bureaucracy, both centrally and duplicated across 42 dioceses (with more senior clergy now than 20 years ago); buildings in virtually every city, town and village, many of cultural importance; the Head of State as its Supreme Governor, reflecting its established status; and control over a quarter of the country&amp;rsquo;s state-funded primary schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But inside the carapace, it is hollowed out. While many appreciate its social work, musical tradition, buildings and people, a rapidly diminishing number identify with it, share its metaphysical beliefs, subscribe to its positions on LGBTQI+ equality &amp;ndash; and still, in some places, gender equality &amp;ndash; or attend its services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You would not know that by reading its strategy. Its vision is still to be &amp;ldquo;A Church for the whole nation which is Jesus Christ centred, and shaped by, the five marks of mission&amp;rdquo;, the first two of which are all about evangelism and proselytisation. As well as becoming &amp;ldquo;younger and more diverse&amp;rdquo;, its strategic priorities are to become a church of &amp;ldquo;missionary disciples&amp;rdquo;, where &amp;ldquo;every person in England has access to an enriching and compelling community of faith by adding new churches and new forms of Church.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;corporate psychosis&amp;rdquo; speaking. Sooner or later, reality must strike, and the carapace adapt to its contents. The question is how this major transition will take place, over what period, and what sort of creature will emerge at the end. We all have an interest in the answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, there is no case for a diminished Church to have a privileged status in the constitution of a plural, and increasingly non-&lt;br&gt;religious, country. Establishment, and with it bishops in the House of Lords, needs to go. And an institution with an evangelical agenda overtly targeting young people should not be in control of state-funded schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from that, maybe a values-based approach offers a way forward. Many people would agree with the other &amp;ldquo;Marks of Mission&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, which are about social justice, violence reduction, peace and reconciliation, and the environment. Instead of faith-based structures accommodating people with a range of values, could there be values-based structures accommodating people with a range of beliefs?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe a new values-based body, or local community trusts, should take ownership of many of the buildings, and most of the wealth, with the Church becoming one of many users of its spaces. Perhaps such a body could find a way, without erasing the history, to provide a community focus without the religious baggage, where everyone locally could feel at home, irrespective of their beliefs, ethnicity, education or income &amp;ndash; an increasingly important need in a fractured society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But conversations about a realistic future are hard to envisage while Church leaders continue in their &amp;ldquo;state of false consciousness&amp;rdquo;. Accepting and managing decline is hard, especially when you think your mission is God-given. But at some stage, something has to give.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
