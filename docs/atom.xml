    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Some bad guys are getting betrayal for Christmas. There are hints that &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mark-meadows-may-cooperating-witness-against-trump-glenn-kirschner-1767500"&gt;Mark Meadows may have been turned&lt;/a&gt;. Meadows was Trump&amp;#8217;s chief of staff, and there are already piles of &lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/12/12/2141506/-Meadows-insurrectionist-texts-have-been-reviewed-by-TalkingPointsMemo-and-they-re-damning?detail=emaildkre&amp;#038;pm_source=DKRE&amp;#038;pm_medium=email"&gt;incriminating memos and text messages&lt;/a&gt; during the insurrection that have turned up, so maybe he&amp;#8217;s seeing some advantages of turning into a witness for the prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/mark-meadows.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/mark-meadows-150x142.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="142" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-68855" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/mark-meadows-150x142.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/mark-meadows.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;There is a very tantalizing comment in the executive summary,&amp;#8221; said Weissmann, a former assistant U.S. attorney who worked on Mueller&amp;#8217;s team. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s hard to call it that because it&amp;#8217;s 160 pages, but in that executive summary there&amp;#8217;s a reference to why the Department of Justice may not have sought to charge Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino with contempt.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you recall, they were both referred by the committee to the Department of Justice for contempt failing to comply with a subpoena, and one of the things the report says, is it sort of speculates, but odd that it says it may be that they&amp;#8217;re already cooperating,&amp;#8221; Weissmann added, &amp;#8220;and with Mark Meadows, that would be huge. I mean, he is in the place to know everything so, obviously, if not cooperating already, there is a ton of pressure that is going to be put on him.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meadows is a real sleaze, but I&amp;#8217;d be happy to trade him for a more robust criminal prosecution against the big orange guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in the news &amp;#8212; Sam Bankman-Fried has been arrested, but the question has been…where is his partner-in-crime, Caroline Ellison? While SBF has been babbling to everyone, including minor league youtubers as well as the big money press, Ellison has been lying low, silent. The answer has been revealed: &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/12/21/caroline-ellison-fraud-charges/"&gt;she&amp;#8217;s been singing like a canary to the feds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/caroline-ellison.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/caroline-ellison-150x140.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="140" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-68856" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/caroline-ellison-150x140.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/caroline-ellison.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Two former colleagues of disgraced cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges that they helped him orchestrate a years-long scheme to defraud investors in FTX, the crypto trading platform that collapsed last month, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives — Caroline Ellison, who served as chief executive of Alameda Research, a hedge fund owned by Bankman-Fried, and Gary Wang, FTX’s former chief technology officer — are cooperating with prosecutors, said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You dirty, yellow-bellied rat!&lt;/p&gt;

<p>It started out as a bland bean soup, but after I added carrots and potatoes and sausage (Impossible Sausage, so still vegan) and onions and garlic and a lot of mysterious spices, it became hearty enough to keep a man (and a woman) warm and strong through even the most savage blizzard Minnesota might throw at us.</p>

    <title>Awaiting a blizzard</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/12/21/awaiting-a-blizzard/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Doesn&amp;#8217;t it give you a little thrill when the National Weather Service informs you of &amp;#8220;life-threatening conditions&amp;#8221; about to descend upon your home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST THURSDAY&amp;#8230; &amp;#8230;WIND CHILL WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM THURSDAY TO NOON CST SATURDAY&amp;#8230; &amp;#8230;BLIZZARD WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM NOON THURSDAY TO 6 AM CST SATURDAY&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT&amp;#8230;For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as 40 below zero. For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 5 to 8 inches. For the Blizzard Warning, blizzard conditions expected. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph. For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills. Wind chills as low as 30 below zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHERE&amp;#8230;Stevens, Pope and Swift Counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEN&amp;#8230;For the Wind Chill Warning, from 6 AM Thursday to noon CST Saturday. For the Winter Storm Warning, from 6 AM Wednesday to noon CST Thursday. For the Blizzard Warning, from noon Thursday to 6 AM CST Saturday. For the Wind Chill Advisory, until midnight CST tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPACTS&amp;#8230;Travel could be very difficult or impossible. Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches. The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADDITIONAL DETAILS&amp;#8230;This could be a life-threatening situation if you get stranded traveling late this week. Consider adjusting any travel plans now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1. Road conditions can also be found at 511mn.org for Minnesota or 511wi.gov for Wisconsin.&lt;br /&gt;
More Information&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8230;ACCUMULATING SNOW WEDNESDAY FOLLOWED BY GROUND BLIZZARD AND DANGEROUSLY COLD CONDITIONS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY&amp;#8230; &amp;#8230;TRAVEL THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT COULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AND LIFE-THREATENING&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.Snow will overspread the region Wednesday and bring 5 to 9 inches of fluffy accumulation through Wednesday night north of a line from Madison to Mankato To Eau Claire, with 3 to 5 inches to the south. Winds will be relatively light Wednesday and Wednesday evening. There should be a break in severe winter conditions late Wednesday night and early Thursday. Then, strong northwest winds gusting as high as 50 mph and dangerously cold air will surge in Thursday afternoon through Friday night. Whiteout conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very difficult or impossible. This event could be life- threatening if you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero range. Travel plans for late this week should be adjusted now. In addition, heavy snow remaining on trees from the last storm and strong winds arriving could result in tree damage and power outages as temperatures drop below zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Winter Storm Warning is in effect Wednesday and Wednesday evening. Then, a Blizzard Warning goes into effect Thursday across southern and western Minnesota, with the Winter Storm Watch continuing north and east where wind and blowing snow will begin a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today &amp;#8212; lots of snow. Tomorrow and the next day &amp;#8212; 50mph winds pick up all the light fluffy stuff and blow it around and around, reducing visibility, making it painfully dangerous to be outside, and drifting all over the roads and highways. I just looked out my window and the snow is already here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m taking this seriously, of course. Shortly, before the snow gets too high, I&amp;#8217;m going across the street to the lab to feed all the spiders and set up the fly stocks for genetics that arrived yesterday, and then I&amp;#8217;ll dart home and hunker down. I&amp;#8217;m planning a big pot of soup &amp;#8212; maybe more of a stew, I&amp;#8217;m planning to throw in lots of chunky vegetables &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;ll tide us over for a few days. And then tonight, I&amp;#8217;ll huddle around the warm glow of the computer monitor and have a conversation with anyone who wants to join in. Unless the power goes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B6i9ntzVhCU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Menu is a different kind of horror movie</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/12/20/the-menu-is-a-different-kind-of-horror-movie/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/themenu.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/themenu-150x111.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="111" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-68845" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/themenu-150x111.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/themenu-300x222.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/themenu-500x370.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/12/themenu.jpeg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"/></a></p>
<p class="lead"><i>The Menu</i> is getting a very short run at the <a href="https://morristheatre.net/blog/">Morris Theater</a>, only a couple of days and then it’s out tonight. It’s not exactly holiday fare, I guess. I got in to see it last night, in a nearly empty theater (the competition running on the second screen is <i>Avatar</i>, which doesn’t interest me in the slightest).</p>
<p>It’s worth seeing! I didn’t know what to expect, and was continually surprised. I could summarize it as your standard horror/slasher movie: obsessed chef with a cult following invites obnoxious upper-class snobs to a private dinner in order to kill them all, the sort of thing you might expect a Vincent Price to headline. But that’s not it at all. Ralph Fiennes is marvelously intense as a chef who has lost all joy in his craft, and plays it with a sorrowful despair. His guests might be frightened at first, but mostly they sink into resignation. “We’re all going to die tonight,” one says, while passively remaining seated at the table. They all stay and eat — no, taste and savor — the weirdly finicky plates of little tidbits artfully tweezered into miniature tableaus in front of them.</p>
<p>Instead of the traditional grisly-murder-one-after-the-other, most of the diners survive to the very end. They instead face psychological torture, becoming increasingly aware of their doom. Even the one set-piece event, in which the men are released onto the island with a 45 second head start before the waitstaff will hunt them down, doesn’t end with any killing — they’re caught and brought back and sit down for the next course. It was more horrifying than culminating the hunt in gore and splatter.</p>
<p>Even the staff are caught up in a cult of depression and despair. No one will get out alive, and all seem to welcome the release of death. There’s no point in living, you know. You’ll never be great enough, other people will suck all the life out of you eventually. Serve the chef, that is all.</p>
<p>The exception to all the doom-and-gloom is Anya Taylor-Joy (is she going to be in every movie from now on?) who plays a prostitute hired by one of the pretentious twits to be his plus one. She is mainly pissed off when she learns her client knew ahead of time that this dinner was going to end in death, and he hired her because he know he couldn’t attend without a partner. She fights back by reminding the chef of a time when he wasn’t jaded and cynical, and even gets an honest smile out of him.</p>
<p>The real monster in the movie turns out to be wealth and capitalism and greed, and how it consumes people with ennui. But it is at heart a true horror movie, it’s just lacking an Abominable Dr Phibes and replaces him with a sense of sorrowful futility.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/">perfect Christmas movie</a>!</p>

&lt;p&gt;Wow, really? That sounds great! Conversations with smart women, sign me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except…that doesn&amp;#8217;t jibe with my personal experience of Twitter, and, well, it&amp;#8217;s out of the lying mouth of Jesse Waters, and the numbers don&amp;#8217;t match up with reality at all, as we might expect of Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Laying claim to Christmas</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6066/laying-claim-to-christmas#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A Roman Feast, by Roberto Bompiani (1821-1908)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/saturnalia-_2_.jpg" height="1035" alt="A Roman Feast (Saturnalia), Second Half of the 19th cen.. Creator: Bompiani, Roberto (1821-1908)" width="1596"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time again, when everyone is spinning in the maelstrom of cheesy TV commercials, crackers, Secret Santas, festive jumpers, hangovers &amp;ndash; and a slew of seasonal anxieties. Will the cards arrive on time? Will the promised turkey materialise? Will the new robot come with batteries? And what on earth can you get for that difficult sister-in-law?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But where, as a self-respecting sceptic, do you draw the line? You won&amp;rsquo;t, presumably, display models of the manger and the shepherds in your front garden, nor an advent calendar on the mantlepiece to build anticipation for the miracle birth. Perhaps you might be tempted to attend Midnight Mass, just for the spectacle, or to go carol-singing because it&amp;rsquo;s for charity. But will you be having a Christmas tree? And if so, how are you planning to decorate it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During these recession-plunged times, you probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend anything at all on fripperies. Instead you could just tart up your existing baubles. The Guardian shows you how to make paper snowflakes, and how to marble your balls. The website &lt;em&gt;YourHomeStyle &lt;/em&gt;recommends using chalk paint to spray over the ornaments, or over the tree for a frosty look. And if you really want to cut down, they suggest, you could always make your own chalk paint which, they guarantee, will ensure your tree will look like nobody else&amp;rsquo;s. Not always in a good way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a natural look you don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend any money at all. Just gather a few twigs, pine cones and springs of holly and smugly parade your green values. As long as you buy locally you could actually be helping the planet as many UK growers will plant new ones for every one cut down &amp;ndash; up to 10 each tree according to the Woodland Trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And real ones are far better than fake. The Carbon Trust calculates that a two-metre artificial tree has a carbon footprint of around 40kg, more than ten times that of a real tree that&amp;rsquo;s burned after Christmas. Most artificial trees are made in China, with the dual environmental impact of being made from plastic, PVC and metal, and then shipped overseas. And they&amp;rsquo;re not recyclable, so when they&amp;rsquo;re inevitably thrown away, they end up in landfill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But why have a tree at all? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re a bit chary about joining in the collective worship of the baby Jesus, alongside all the paraphernalia of nativities, carol services and church-going. But if you do crave a tree you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry that you&amp;rsquo;re subscribing to the Christian myth. Evergreen trees have been a potent symbol in numerous cultures across the world long before the birth in the stable. Christianity simply co-opted existing rituals and made them its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoCommentText"&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until after 300 BC that the emperor Constantine made Christianity a State 'religion'. Before then, the Roman's winter celebration of Saturnalia bore striking similarities to our Christmas traditions today. People lit candles, gave gifts and decorated trees in honour of Saturn, the god of sewing and seeds. Saturnalia was for some time celebrated around the winter solstice in late December, and some have argued that it is the forebear of our Christmas tradition today. Equally, it could just be that humans down the centuries have liked to feast, drink, make fire and contemplate the regenerative power of nature at the darkest and bleakest point of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Middle East many civilisations worshipped a version of the goddess Asherah, the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Heaven&amp;rdquo;. Her main symbol was a pole or a tree, which the ancient Canaanites viewed as a signifier of fertility. Druids are thought to have believed that the white berries of mistletoe represented the semen of the gods. Wreaths, in the pagan tradition, were made in a circle to stand for female fertility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoCommentText"&gt;Some pagans regard the red berries of the holly as a symbol of menstrual blood while Wiccans use holly wood to make wands. Both holly and mistletoe were hung in doorways of temples and homes to invoke powers of fertility in those who stood beneath and kissed, causing the spirits of the god and goddess to enter them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The association of the evergreen fir with carnality hasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely disappeared. A few years ago outraged residents of a northern town in Russia reacted furiously to the appearance of a phallic-looking Christmas tree outside the local concert hall. Some demanded that authorities remove the bizarre-shaped tree, which they nicknamed the &amp;ldquo;penis fir&amp;rdquo; because of its extremely bulbous bottom and shaft-like top.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No wonder they were upset. Once Christianity had taken over, with its obsessive obliteration of sex, no such base allusions were allowed, so the phallic symbols were replaced by Biblical ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red berries came to represent the blood of Christ, and the pointy leaves the crown of thorns placed upon his head as he was crucified. Wreaths, you won&amp;rsquo;t be surprised to learn, are no longer wombs. Instead they are a sign of God&amp;rsquo;s eternal love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re finding all of this stifling symbolism too much to take, you can always create your own atheist semiotic code instead. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the evergreen tree itself which in all cultures means immortality and the promise of rebirth. So it&amp;rsquo;s just as meaningful for humanists, as a celebration of the cycle of life. You&amp;rsquo;re definitely okay with tinsel, too. Simply redefine it as a manifestation of religious superstition: a shiny rope winding over the leaves of logic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what will you put on the top? Presumably not an angel which, in Christian iconography, refers to the one who appeared high in the sky on the first Christmas, heralding the birth of Jesus. A star? Sorry &amp;ndash; the star represents the Star of Bethlehem, which guided the Three Wise Men to the stable where Jesus was born.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of these you could select a favourite secular saint. How about a figure of Einstein, to demonstrate the value of science? Or Emmeline Pankhurst for feminism? One year I draped a &amp;ldquo;Votes for Women&amp;rdquo; sash round the tree, but the masculine holly snagged it to shreds. For a different version of tribal worship why not a likeness of England football manager Gareth Southgate? These are easily available and probably, these days, cut price. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to invest in a real statue, just cut out a picture and paste it on to card. I once did that with a portrait of the American actress, writer and singer Mae West, proclaiming, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;lsquo;m no Angel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="trt0xe"&gt;That was just one of her proud boasts during her seven-decade entertainment career. She was famous for her outspoken sexual appetite and bawdy one-liners. &amp;ldquo;When I&amp;rsquo;m good I&amp;rsquo;m very good,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;but when I&amp;rsquo;m bad I&amp;rsquo;m better.&amp;rdquo; And, she explained, &amp;ldquo;I used to be Snow White, but I drifted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now to the lights. Christmas trees used to be decorated with candles, symbolising Jesus as a divine light, and the star that led the three wise men. Today&amp;rsquo;s tree lights can also be seen as the stars and planets in the firmament. But for pagans, the use of light around the winter solstice represented the promise of light in the darkest time of year. Which couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more humanist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So let your Christmas tree celebrate that most sacred of secular movements: the Enlightenment. Rejoice in the sign of the rebirth of science, the glory of human endeavour, the triumph of reason over superstition, and a promise of better, more rational times to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Provided you don&amp;rsquo;t get the ones that flicker.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Harvard’s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6054/book-review-harvards-quixotic-pursuit-of-a-new-science#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Harvard University campus, 2009" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Harvard_University_campus-314.jpeg" height="668" alt="Harvard University campus" width="1019"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harvard&amp;rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science (Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;by Patrick L. Schmidt &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Harvard, a place of tradition and legacy, does not take kindly to proposals for major organisational restructuring. Yet, in 1946, a group of scholars did just that when they received permission to combine the disciplines of anthropology, sociology and social psychology into a single department. The birth, life and death of this department, called the Department of Social Relations, are described in detail in Patrick L. Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s new book &lt;em&gt;Harvard&amp;rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;It is no coincidence that Social Relations opened its doors after the Second World War, a conflict whose origins and implications Harvard&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Three&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the disciplines of history, economics and government &amp;ndash; struggled to explain. Social Relations not only copied an interdisciplinary model already in use at other Ivy Leagues, but also gave faculty the freedom to pursue emerging theories and areas of study that were not receiving adequate attention inside their respective departments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;The department of psychology was especially narrowminded in this regard. Prior to the establishment of Social Relations, psychology at Harvard was dominated by experimental psychologists. They were called &amp;ldquo;experimental&amp;rdquo; not because they were interested in exploring uncharted territory, but because they wanted to study the human mind through observable behaviour only, pushing professors Henry Murray and Gordon Allport &amp;ndash; interested in invisible mental processes &amp;ndash; to join Social Relations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Schmidt captures the intellectual drama that accompanied the development of the department. Conflicts of interest or ideas are thoroughly explained and livened up with quotes from faculty. Especially memorable is the recollection of Allport&amp;rsquo;s awkward meeting with Sigmund Freud, whose fixation with the unconscious bothered him almost as much as Harvard&amp;rsquo;s focus on behaviour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;In theory, Social Relations was meant to be an interdisciplinary program. In practice, it was more multidisciplinary, with students and teachers sticking to their primary disciplines. One of the department&amp;rsquo;s founders, sociologist Talcott Parsons, wrote &lt;em&gt;Towards a General Theory of Social Action&lt;/em&gt; in an attempt to unify the discipline, and create &lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;social relations&amp;rdquo; as a new science, but the social psychologists in the department remained unconvinced, as did many sociologists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Why write a book about a failed intellectual project? Firstly, because of what was achieved along the way. Internal division did not stop the Department of Social Relations from delivering outstanding scholarship. As the Iron Curtain dropped, the department&amp;rsquo;s Russian Research Center provided Washington with intel on the Soviet Union. Led by anthropologist and Social Relations founder Clyde Kluckhohn, the centre studied all aspects of Soviet life to determine how it would respond to attacks from the American military. Scholars say it showed research can be politically motivated while still being academically sound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Social Relations disintegrated in the early 1970s when anthropology, sociology and social psychology were once again separated into their own departments. This was due in part to a PR crisis which ensued after professors Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) gave psilocybin and mescaline to undergraduates as part of their Harvard Psychedelic Project, promoting drug use on university grounds and establishing themselves as counterculture icons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;At the time, the Leary-Alpert scandal damaged Social Relations&amp;rsquo; credibility in the academic world. Today, with attitudes towards psychedelics changing and research into their medical and mental benefits resuming, the project&amp;rsquo;s legacy is being reassessed. Equally controversial upon its inception &amp;ndash; and retrospectively ahead of its time &amp;ndash; was a 1968 course called Social Change in America, which examined imperialism, race and labour amid mounting student protests against the Vietnam War.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s book is not only an instructive story of intellectual hubris and academic scandal. It also offers insight into ongoing debates over education, knowledge, power and progress. The author&amp;rsquo;s biography might seem unusual, as he is neither a historian nor a social scientist, but an attorney in Washington D.C. However, he was present on the scene, having written his honours thesis at Harvard on the history of Social Relations, just after the department&amp;rsquo;s demise. The Social Relations department might have approved, given their open-minded approach to hiring people. For example, in 1959, the faculty welcomed David Riesman, a former lawyer who&amp;rsquo;d entered academia through the virtue of his independent research. He went on to a fellowship at Yale where he wrote &lt;em&gt;The Lonely Crowd&lt;/em&gt;, considered to be a landmark study of American character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;In the case of &lt;em&gt;Harvard&amp;rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science&lt;/em&gt;, the unorthodox approach has borne fruit. Through meticulous research and compelling writing, Schmidt has taken a set of dry, inaccessible institutional records and turned them into a gripping intellectual drama. Best of all, he&amp;rsquo;s managed to do so without sensationalising his subject or shying away from semantics. A must-read for anyone interested in how educational systems are developed and their effect on the way we view the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Why we need a radical approach to the countryside</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6053/why-we-need-a-radical-approach-to-the-countryside#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Flatford Mill (&amp;lsquo;Scene on a Navigable River&amp;rsquo;) by John Constable, 1816" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Constab_e.jpeg" height="817" alt="Flatford Mill by John Constable, 1816" width="1024"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It is the strangest doublethink. As I write, one third of Pakistan is underwater. Recently in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by David Armstrong McKay published findings that indicate global warming has already passed the threshold for triggering five disastrous tipping points, from ice-sheet collapse to permafrost thaw. Even in temperate Britain, summer 2022 brought widespread drought and the highest temperatures the country has ever recorded. We &amp;ndash; at least, &amp;ldquo;we progressives&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; know this. Yet our default, when it comes to the natural environment, seems to be a long comfortable yawn. That stuff &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo;, the barely differentiated bird and plant life blurring beyond the car windows, isn&amp;rsquo;t really worth getting to know, is it? We seem to assume it is a cultural and political dead zone, where nothing interesting could possibly happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Yet we make an exception for big-scale nature. Shades of imperial heroics haunt TV expeditions to film rare, faraway species, or beautifully judged literary works in which middle-class white men go off alone to explore mountains, woods or rivers &amp;ndash; othering even the natural environment. Of course, something is better than nothing. No one would deny that David Attenborough, or writers like Richard Deakin or Robert MacFarlane, have made a difference not only to the popularity of the natural world as entertainment, but to what we know about it. But still, this strikes a somewhat post-colonial note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to make some insulting equivalence between the human suffering Britain and other countries have already inflicted, and the suffering being inflicted on our neighbour species today. But, while unchecked climate change will eventually destroy us all, the people who will suffer first and worst will be in the global south. And in both the recent imperial past and the near future, this damage results from a culture of othering. It is a dangerous nonsense to turn the world around us &amp;ndash; like the people of that world &amp;ndash; into something we don&amp;rsquo;t need to bother with because it is both, in the immortal words of Father Ted, &amp;ldquo;small: far away&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not from London,&amp;rdquo; cry the hopelessly metropolitan protagonists of&lt;em&gt; Withnail and I&lt;/em&gt; (1987), out of their depth in the rain-soaked Lake District. But of course they are: and the satire, rounded like all the best writing, shows their agreeable heedlessness, as they leave field gates open wide, solicit a poacher in public and prove unable even to feed themselves. The natural environment is neither tiny nor distant. Today&amp;rsquo;s intellectual and, increasingly, popular cultures take the collapse of the global biosphere seriously. But not so the fact that the quotidian, vaguely apprehended British countryside is &amp;ndash; for all of us here on these islands, right now, in every moment &amp;ndash; our local natural environment. The countryside is what our urban areas sit within; and it&amp;rsquo;s what sustains them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The countryside is anything but a-political&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also an increasingly radicalised space, at the forefront of our collective attempts to manage the climate emergency. The Johnson administration was close to advocates of rewilding. Farming communities &amp;ndash; particularly in the less wealthy parts of the country often selected for such projects, because land there costs less &amp;ndash; see rewilding as a rich man&amp;rsquo;s hobby which is pricing them out of existence. Some explicitly cite parallels with the paralegal process of enclosure, which culminated in the 18th century. This saw productive agriculture, and the livelihoods of ordinary people in rural communities, cleared away to make room for the hobby parks and model farms of the wealthy. As today&amp;rsquo;s farmers point out, food comes ultimately from land, not factories; food security is an important part of biosecurity; and farming where we live slashes carbon-heavy food miles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The connection between land and food, though, often seems to be missing from rewilders&amp;rsquo; thinking: perhaps because the reality, which is that we need to find ways to farm sustainably, is so complex. Connected thought is also missing from the commercial strategy of buying up productive farmland for carbon offset sinks. Changing ownership of a green space does not create more of it. Meanwhile, amid political chaos at Westminster, the environment appears to be low on the agenda. The short-lived Truss government was not interested even in greenwashing; her September mini-budget was seen by environmentalists as a clear &amp;ldquo;attack on nature&amp;rdquo;. Sunak&amp;rsquo;s government reversed many of these measures &amp;ndash; reinstating the ban on fracking and pledging more offshore wind &amp;ndash; but ministers have repeatedly framed environmental issues as a sideshow. The early days of Sunak&amp;rsquo;s premiership were dogged by controversy over his reluctance to attend the COP27 climate summit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s gone wrong? Why can we not fix our attention on the British countryside for long enough to think and act rationally in relation to it? More than we surely realise &amp;ndash; and leaving aside the particular shamelessness of this new governmental asset-stripping &amp;ndash; this has to do with our culture. If we think of our natural environment as remote, it&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s so often presented that way. When William Morris designed his wallpapers and fabrics, in which vines and roses become a repeating frieze, he was developing what he understood as good socialist practice. In his workshops, craftsmen and women could earn their living in ways that allowed them to further their skills, and to take ownership of the (improved) results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Yet it was adoption in the nation&amp;rsquo;s gift shops that finally made these designs ubiquitous &amp;ndash; as symbols, ironically, of middle-class Britain. We no longer hear, in their handmade origins, the echo of earlier movements seeking to afford workers self-sufficiency, such as Chartism. Instead, we fall back on thinking of workers and their rights as necessarily urban. That we do so is another consequence of enclosure because the ordinary people it displaced into cities became cheap labour for the industrial revolution&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;dark Satanic mills.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;That famous phrase comes from the Romantic poet William Blake (in &amp;ldquo;Jerusalem&amp;rdquo;). It&amp;rsquo;s something of an irony that, at the very time these upheavals were taking place, Romanticism was advancing ideas of human rights centering on the inalienable status of the self as a human. We take for granted the ideas of liberty and equality, if not fraternity, that were first linked by Fran&amp;ccedil;ois F&amp;eacute;nelon at the dawn of the Enlightenment; they took their first steps onto the political stage with the Romantic-era French Revolution. On this side of the Channel, political philosophers including William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, politicised intellectuals Thomas Jefferson Hogg and James Leigh Hunt, and writers and activists including Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, were arguing for a person-centred dismantling of traditional institutions, including monarchy and marriage, and a recourse to personal judgment rather than social and religious obedience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;Let's learn from the Romantics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;So the fine-tuned Romantic &amp;ldquo;sensibility&amp;rdquo; the more conservative Jane Austen mocked in &lt;em&gt;Sense and Sensibility &lt;/em&gt;(1811) and &lt;em&gt;Northanger Abbey &lt;/em&gt;(1817) was more than self-indulgence. It was a form of heightened awareness underpinned by political philosophy. The Tory governments of the early 19th century effectively stamped out revolutionary thought, not least by repeated suspensions of habeas corpus and the right to a fair trial. This posed a threat for those it deemed subversives: many, including the Leigh Hunts and the Shelleys, went into political exile in Europe. And it&amp;rsquo;s this, rather than mere emotion or artistic expression, that&amp;rsquo;s actually going on in those Romantic representations of the natural environment which are so often, paradoxically, co-opted to present the British countryside as picturesque, old-fashioned and unchanging. In fact, these representations were urgently new: and they were created in response to an era of rapid change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Look again and the evidence is everywhere, as I rediscovered recently in writing and thinking about the Romantic encounter with the countryside. William Wordsworth &amp;ldquo;wandered lonely as a cloud&amp;rdquo; because the countryside was newly depopulated, and the sense you get when you&amp;rsquo;re alone in the high fells is vertiginous &amp;ndash; like looking up into a nearly cloudless sky and wondering why you don&amp;rsquo;t fall up into it. John Constable&amp;rsquo;s Dedham Vale, away from the worker community at Flatford Mill, is empty for the same reason, as the solitary observer becomes newly aware of every rustle or squeak. J. M. W. Turner&amp;rsquo;s wide horizons record this too, as up to date in their way as his brilliant portrayal of speed on Maidenhead viaduct in &lt;em&gt;Wind, Steam, Speed&lt;/em&gt;. Percy Bysshe Shelley&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Ode to the West Wind&amp;rdquo; takes a high wind in Florence as an occasion to evoke the human &amp;ndash; and ecological &amp;ndash; potential for change and revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m saying, then, is that in a time of crisis we need to pay attention to everything surrounding us. Not only our natural environment, but our culture. We should keep a particular eye on ideas so familiar we think they&amp;rsquo;re our own. Our assumptions about the countryside have held us back from paying attention to catastrophes unfolding there in plain sight. Such assumptions emerge from historical and cultural circumstance. They are the reason we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ignore historical moments like Romanticism, which have shaped our relationship with rural life, and which therefore cannot be &amp;ldquo;over and done&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Close up, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the Wordsworths in Somerset &amp;ndash; or Lord Byron and the Shelleys in Switzerland &amp;ndash; probably splashed about in country mud just as helplessly as Bruce Robinson&amp;rsquo;s Withnail. But the lesson of Romanticism itself &amp;ndash; rather than our reception of it as decorative clich&amp;eacute; &amp;ndash; must be its fearlessness in taking the rural environment as a site of and for radical rethinking. We too need to become unafraid of the proximity of the countryside: as the series of lived realities with which, even in town, we all relate. And if an increasingly authoritarian government claims that paying attention to such things is both uneconomic and impractical &amp;ndash; arts and humanities, anyone? &amp;ndash; perhaps we need to ask ourselves whose version of the natural environment, as of things in general, we are meant unquestioningly to accept.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fiona Sampson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Starlight Wood: Walking Back to the Romantic Countryside&amp;rdquo; is published by Hachette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Holiday? No thanks</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6052/holiday-no-thanks#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHUmanistLaurieheadstand.jpg" height="589" alt="Laurie Taylor hates holidays" width="410"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I sidle out of bed every morning I am increasingly put in mind of the Lewis Carroll poem: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;You are old, Father William,&amp;rsquo; the young man said, / &amp;lsquo;And your hair has become very white; / And yet you incessantly stand on your head&amp;ndash; / Do you think, at your age, it is right?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In truth, I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly emulate Father William&amp;rsquo;s headstand, but I do embark on a series of rather bizarre physical exercises. Before I risk a trip to the bathroom, I check that my surgically replaced ankle is in good working order by standing on one leg for several seconds. Then I need a few minutes of running on the spot to prove that my newly fitted pacemaker is ticking over nicely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are only the more dramatic signs. They sit alongside more mundane evidence of physical deterioration: an anxiety about biting into apples, a refusal to run for buses, a declining capacity to throw up both arms in any sort of exultation, and a distinct unreadiness to bend down in a public place and tie up my shoelaces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all these corporeal concerns count for little when set against my new existential discovery. It can be simply stated: I never, ever, never, ever want to go on holiday again. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend so much as a single night in a small hotel in Paris, or a fat villa in Antibes. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to travel several thousand miles in order to look at tropical birds and a basking hippopotamus. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sit on a yacht, walk the Pilgrims&amp;rsquo; Way or be sculled through Venice by a singing gondolier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new-found reluctance to leave home has nothing to do with any anxiety about the customary hassles of travelling. It is entirely prompted by a recent aversion to nearly every one of the delights that are so regularly reported by friends who have returned from holiday. The more they tell me about their vacation, the more my resolution is stiffened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, for example, on my writing desk, is a recently received picture of Michael and Janet lounging on white plastic sun-beds beside a blue swimming pool somewhere in the south of France. &amp;ldquo;We are really away from it all at last,&amp;rdquo; runs the self-congratulatory message. The photo is in perfectly focused glossy Technicolor, but all I can see is an encroaching greyness: the perceptual deprivation induced by having nothing to stare at for hour after hour apart from a stretch of flat chlorinated water and the constant fear of losing your lounger when you depart to grab some buffet lunch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But far more relevant to my new resolution is this report from Charlotte and James. They&amp;rsquo;re an acerbic couple, always alert to hypocrisy and double standards. But still they can&amp;rsquo;t wait to tell me in an email that &amp;ldquo;Yesterday we visited the magnificent cathedral. Such a solemn and holy place, with crowds of worshippers before the renowned statue of the Virgin Mary. An unforgettable experience!&amp;rdquo; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Charlotte and James are hardly alone. Over the years, dozens of my agnostic and atheist friends who would normally no more visit a holy building than volunteer to tour the local abattoir have reported in rapturous tone on their &amp;ldquo;delightful&amp;rdquo; visits to foreign churches and abbeys and monasteries. But more than that. They&amp;rsquo;ve told me in detail about the wonders of attending religious processions and parades. &amp;ldquo;Laurie. If you look closely at the head of the procession you can see the casket that is said to contain a splinter from the Holy Cross.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I suspect that none of these factors contribute so much to my abhorrence of holidays as my loss of a critical cognitive faculty. To put it simply, I no longer have the mental capacity to pretend that matters are really better than they actually are, to simulate my delight at a merely average French seaside restaurant, or a garish Italian sunset, or an over-extended Portuguese fado, or the discovery that my hotel room bears only a parodic reference to the one featured in the brochure. I can only recall Robert Robinson&amp;rsquo;s astute observation that wherever you stay on holiday will always be less comfortable than your home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all, I have far more sensible and reasonable matters to attend to than a holiday. Tomorrow, for example, I intend to practise standing on my head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2022 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Rethinking the origins of life</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6051/rethinking-the-origins-of-life#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/rowsonsmall.jpg" height="1663" alt="Martin Rowson cartoon on the origins of life in deep sea vents" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The origin of life is such a fabled event (more than 4 billion years ago) that searching for clues on the Earth today might seem a fool&amp;rsquo;s errand. But, piece by piece, a wonderfully interlocking skein of evidence is emerging. It began with a chance encounter in the deep ocean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1977, the deep-sea submersible research vessel Alvin discovered hot upwelling mineral vents &amp;ndash; black smokers &amp;ndash; in the deep Pacific Ocean, off the coast of California. Such upwellings occur near the boundaries of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s tectonic plates where there is volcanic activity. The streams that pour out are hot water laced with minerals that then accumulate and grow into rocky towers. The interest of biologists and biochemists was piqued by the constant flow of hot, chemically rich effluents, which suggested that this might be life&amp;rsquo;s birthplace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The energetic chemistry discovered in the black smokers bore some resemblance to the energy metabolism of modern cells, especially in the presence of iron-sulphur clusters. These clusters lie at the heart of many of life&amp;rsquo;s nanomachines &amp;ndash; large protein complexes, often with moving parts &amp;ndash; that perform life&amp;rsquo;s key functions (see my article &amp;ldquo;Nature&amp;rsquo;s Nanomachines&amp;rdquo; in the Spring 2021 edition of &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black smokers proved to be a dead end: they were too hot and unstable to have been a source of early life. However, the idea that deep sea vents might point to the secret of the origin of life was taken up by other researchers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1988, the geochemist Mike Russell, at Glasgow University, predicted the existence of another kind of hydrothermal vent: alkaline, and much cooler. This vent, he hypothesised, could have used hydrogen spewing from the effluents to react with dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean waters, creating the precursor chemicals of life. In fact, Russell made the claim: &amp;ldquo;The purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This may sound grandiose &amp;ndash; but as it turned out, Russell was correct. In December 2000, mysterious white chimney structures, now dubbed the Lost City, were found by chance by the same submersible vessel on the mid-Atlantic seafloor. (The very best science is done like this: a prediction &amp;ndash; often seemingly improbable &amp;ndash; followed by the clinching discovery.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most exciting revelation of the calcium carbonate chimneys, which are up to 60m tall, was their porous structure. Each has many tiny holes like a mineralised sponge, through which, as Russell predicted, alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen and minerals really do pour into an acidic ocean which contains dissolved CO2 (the ocean is mildly acidic now, but it was much more so 4 billion years ago). In primeval conditions, these vents could have spawned and harboured the necessary ingredients and the right conditions to promote the growth of biomass. It seems that we might have finally found the birthplace of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;"Life is a river that never stalls"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, much work has been done on deep-sea vents. There is a striking similarity between their chemistry and the biochemistry of primitive bacteria which still exist today and can live on purely chemical substances. As a result, we now have a detailed and highly plausible account of how life probably arose. These are exciting times, but the science is complex and difficult to explain to the general public. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thankfully, one of the researchers working on the origin of life is also an excellent communicator. Nick Lane, professor of evolutionary biochemistry at University College London, has been working on the question of what life is, and how it began, for more than a decade. Most biologists see life in terms of information encoded by DNA, but Lane focuses on the flow of energy through living things. In his latest book, &lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt;, which came out in May 2022, he writes that his aim is to &amp;ldquo;explain how the flow of energy and matter structures the evolution of life and even genetic information. I want to turn the standard view upside down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An analogy for Lane&amp;rsquo;s view of life can be found in rivers. A river is only a river if it is in motion, and that motion requires energy. Rivers are not only water, just as living things are not only the chemicals that comprise them. In every living cell, chemical matter is incessantly in motion to a frantic degree. Humans die very quickly if oxygen is withdrawn, but what kills us is not suffocation but a collapse of the energy flow through every cell. &lt;br&gt;Living things need fuel to power the metabolism of life. They get this by trading gases with the environment: for plants in today&amp;rsquo;s world, that means CO2 in, oxygen out, and the reverse for animals. Life is reproduced through DNA. But the puzzle has always been to discover how primitive chemistry could have led to intricate biochemistry in the first place. Darwin memorably mused on the subject of the origin of life:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But if (and oh what a big if) we could conceive in some warm little pond with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity etcetera present, that a protein compound was chemically formed, ready to undergo still more complex changes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This seemed unlikely, because in open water any interesting chemistry would quickly be dispersed &amp;ndash; a drop in the ocean is more than a metaphor here. However, we can now hypothesise that this is where the deep-sea vents came into play. They could have provided a shelter in their pores in which useful molecules could accumulate in the unceasing flow. Over millions of years, the constancy of the same upwellings satisfies the &amp;ldquo;life is a river that never stalls&amp;rdquo; requirement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what on the primeval Earth could have enabled the vital reaction between CO2 and hydrogen? This is the problem that Lane&amp;rsquo;s lab and others have been working on. In 2020, a research team led by Lane&amp;rsquo;s former student Victor Sojo, with Reuben Hudson, managed to mimic conditions in the primordial vents. They demonstrated that an energy gradient that exists in the vents between the alkaline effluents and the acid ocean was indeed capable of hydrogenating CO2. Other labs are producing similar results, confirming what was long suspected but difficult to prove. Lane says: &amp;ldquo;I take my hat off to them&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The beginning of natural selection&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the first requirement of life is the hydrogenation of CO2, what is needed next? All life today is composed of cells and new life can now only come into being through the division of living cells. Cells are cells because they are bounded by a membrane &amp;ndash; a barrier between the non-living outside world and the living interior (or between one cell and another). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cell membranes are made from fatty acids which behave like detergents in that one end of the molecule is water repellent and one end is water loving. In the reactions that occur in the vents, long-chain fatty acids would have formed easily. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple lab demonstration to show that these fatty acids will self-assemble into bilayer spheres in water, with the fatty ends butting together, separating the watery world inside from the watery world outside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the idea is that the pores in the chimneys were a template for protocells with this bilayer structure. This was the beginning of the metabolism that powers all cells today. The minerals that pour out of the vents have catalytic properties and would have created a positive feedback loop in which the protocells that could fix more carbon would come to dominate the vents. This was the beginning of natural selection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt;, Lane demonstrates the centrality of this metabolism to all life in a suite of reactions that goes by the name of the Krebs Cycle, after the great biochemist Hans Krebs (1900-1981). The textbook Krebs Cycle describes oxygen &amp;ldquo;burning&amp;rdquo; glucose to provide energy and to create the basic biomass of life, whilst emitting CO2 in the process. It is at the heart of the way that animals like us live and move and exist. Ironically, Lane&amp;rsquo;s first encounter with learning about the cycle was unpropitious. &amp;ldquo;I did biology and chemistry at school and loved them both and thought that combination was perfect but I did biochemistry at university and hated it,&amp;rdquo; he told me, &amp;ldquo;hated it because I was told to memorise pathways off by heart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It turned out that this rote learning was not only tedious and unhelpful. It also sold the Krebs Cycle short. The cycle had already been revealed, back in 1966, to be more complicated than the textbook version. It was capable of working backwards, starting with CO2 and creating biomass from the products of that first reaction with hydrogen. As is often the way, however, this concept was resisted by the research community for more than 20 years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reverse Krebs Cycle is now fully recognised and is vital to the hypothesis that life may have emerged from the deep-sea vents, long before the existence of DNA or its cousin RNA. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is highly promising, but as Lane himself admits in &lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;ldquo;many a beautiful idea has been killed by ugly facts&amp;rdquo;. The search for life&amp;rsquo;s greatest prizes has always been tortuous, but many teams of researchers are working to confirm Lane&amp;rsquo;s ideas experimentally. He makes sure, in the book, to fully acknowledge the work of his PhD students and post-doctoral researchers. Great strides are being made, but more hard evidence is needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The overriding idea of the vent hypothesis is that the chemistry that existed in the pores of the vents was eventually interiorised by the protocells that nestled within them. In a thrilling recent experiment in Lane&amp;rsquo;s lab, Sean Jordan and Hanadi Rammu discovered that protocells form particularly readily in simulated vent conditions. The amino acid cysteine, mixed with iron and sulphides found in the vents, produced exactly the kind of iron-sulphur clusters at the heart of modern protein enzymes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Did the origins of life involve DNA?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One area of research is revealing how the deep-sea vents might have produced the molecule ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the universal fuel of life, powering every move we make and every internal process in all living things. Lane&amp;rsquo;s PhD researcher Silvana Pinna is investigating how this vital molecule might have originated in the hydrothermal vents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the very early stages of the vents, the chemicals formed would have been tiny molecules with only a handful of atoms. Life in its developed form uses giant molecules &amp;ndash; long chains wound into a double helix in DNA or folded into intricate structures in proteins. Pinna has shown that the simple molecule acetyl phosphate can catalyse the formation of ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and that this reaction is chemically favoured under hydrothermal conditions. The paper by Pinna and her colleagues, recently published by the journal PLOS Biology, concludes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This implies that ATP could have become the universal energy currency of life not as the endpoint of genetic selection or as a frozen accident, but for fundamental chemical reasons.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other researchers, such as Markus Ralser, the Einstein professor of biochemistry at the Einstein Foundation in Berlin, are producing similar results in finding purely chemical routes to the basic building blocks of life. Lane told me: &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s great about Markus&amp;rsquo;s work is that he&amp;rsquo;s brought attention to something that he calls the &amp;lsquo;end product problem&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; This poses the apparently awkward fact that the intermediate stages of the Krebs cycle only make sense when they are all in place. Both Ralser&amp;rsquo;s and Lane&amp;rsquo;s labs have found that Krebs and other key intermediates occur in sequence by simple chemistry alone, as opposed to the chemistry that can only be performed in living things today by the complex protein enzymes in every living cell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such chemistry, with that river metaphor in mind, is as natural as water flowing downstream. It&amp;rsquo;s the chemistry of reactions that happen by necessity, as when hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water, or sodium with chlorine to form sodium chloride. The success of work like this leads Lane to suggest: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m coming to believe that the whole of biochemistry up to nucleotide synthesis just happens spontaneously . . . It&amp;rsquo;s just built into the chemistry of CO2&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a remarkable conclusion, overturning the generally held assumption that the origin of life must have had something to do with DNA or its cousin RNA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;"Tornado in the junkyard"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life originating by purely chemical means was once considered so far-fetched that the astronomer Fred Hoyle compared it, in 1983, to &amp;ldquo;the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747&amp;rdquo;. But it seems that the currents that flow though the hydrothermal vents really are the &amp;ldquo;tornado in the junkyard&amp;rdquo;, able to create some of life&amp;rsquo;s early metabolism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This theory could also solve the problem of how DNA originated. Today, new life is produced by coding from DNA, but a code can&amp;rsquo;t predate the thing coded for. How did it emerge in the first place? The genetic code by which DNA spells out the composition of proteins is regarded by some as a frozen accident &amp;ndash; there seems no rhyme or reason to it, like the Morse code, which could just as well have a completely different pattern of dots and dashes. But a recent paper published in the journal Biochimica et Biophysica Acta &amp;ndash; Bioenergetics by Lane&amp;rsquo;s PhD students &amp;ndash; Stuart Harrison, Raquel Nunes Palmeira and Aaron Halpern &amp;ndash; shows how the genetic code most likely evolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have discovered that the nucleotide bases that form DNA and its more primordial cousin RNA actually have a direct chemical affinity for particular amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The early little strings of nucleotides &amp;ndash; forerunners of the great chains of RNA and DNA &amp;ndash; had no coding function: in the first instance, they were catalysts, just like the iron-sulphur clusters before them and the protein enzymes that succeeded them. But then, depending on their position in the reverse Krebs cycle, particular amino acids became associated with one or other of the four RNA bases. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors of the paper conclude by noting that coding &amp;ndash; biological information encoded in genes &amp;ndash; thus emerged by chemical necessity. The genetic code wasn&amp;rsquo;t imposed on life, but evolved alongside it. The theory &amp;ldquo;offers a framework that enables the transition from deterministic chemistry to genetic information at the origin of life&amp;rdquo; [my italics]. This is a conclusion as dramatic as that of Watson and Crick&amp;rsquo;s iconic 1953 paper, in which they posited that DNA was the means through which life was reproduced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the discovery of DNA, inquiries into the origin of life have tended to focus on how DNA replication and the genetic code originated. How could complex life have begun to develop without such a code? We may now be opening a new chapter in biology that turns our assumptions upside down. The work of Lane and his colleagues shows that the complex lifeforms that exist on Earth today may have evolved from simple beginnings. The systems that power these lifeforms may seem bafflingly sophisticated, but they could have evolved by purely chemical means. Now, we see how, from the ever-pulsing currents on the primeval ocean floor, life could have booted itself up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
