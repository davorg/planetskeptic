<blockquote class="creationist"><p>As believers, we cannot in good conscience use transgendered pronouns—no matter our intentions—because, in doing so, we are lying. When we use she/her (or Miss or Mrs.) for a man or he/him (or Mr.) for a female, we are participating in the lie that sex/gender is on a spectrum or that a man can be a woman and a woman a man. Or if we use “they/them” (or Mx., etc.) or the myriad of other “pronoun” options today, we are participating in the lie that humans are not innately sexed as either male or female. We’re participating in the lie that humans can choose to be or are naturally androgenous or ambiguous, when that is not true because God has created us either male or female.</p></blockquote>
<p>One problem with his excuse is that Ken Ham has never been reluctant about lying, whether it’s to get tax breaks on his con game or his claims about science. He’s also lying here: it’s not about preserving his honesty at all, or he’d just come out and plainly state that it’s because he thinks gay and trans people should burn in hell.</p>

    <title>Could be grim…but I’ll probably watch it</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/22/could-be-grimbut-ill-probably-watch-it/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;On 2 June, we get a new &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/duggar-documentary-series_n_6467cc92e4b0005c605923ae"&gt;docuseries on the Duggars&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Gothard, and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_in_Basic_Life_Principles"&gt;IBLP cult&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s going to be &lt;em&gt;ugly&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;ll be hours of hateful, stupid people manipulating each other…so kinda like &lt;i&gt;Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&lt;/i&gt;, only with more religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tw1rAMzPf70" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s an interesting new genre: documentaries exposing the seedy, tawdry abuses within religious organizations. I saw one episode of another series, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/the-secrets-of-hillsong-carl-lentz-1850438481"&gt;The Secrets of Hillsong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, this weekend. So far, I&amp;#8217;m not impressed, since it was dedicated to giving Carl Lentz&amp;#8217;s side of the story, and we already know he&amp;#8217;s a creepy sexual predator…so subsequent episodes better give the victims&amp;#8217; side of the story. It promises to get much juicier and unpleasant in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual abuse is a central theme of the first half of the four-part docuseries. Hillsong founder Brian Houston is the one who confronted Lentz on his inappropriate sexual relations and oversaw Lentz’s removal, but Houston, too, would be ousted from the church in 2022 for his own infidelities—and currently faces up to five years in jail for allegedly helping to cover up his father Frank Houston’s sexual abuse of children. In 1977, Frank founded the original iteration of Hillsong, the Sydney Christian Life Centre, but stepped down when pedophilia allegations against him emerged in 1998. Nonetheless, Frank was invited to pray with former President Trump at the White House in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Vanity Fair reported in 2021 that a college student and congregant named Anna Crenshaw alleged that she was sexually abused in 2015 by Hillsong staffer Jason Mays, who had already previously pleaded guilty to indecent assault. Despite these allegations against Mays, Hillsong briefly suspended then reinstated him. Even back in 2018, according to Page Six, whistleblowers in the church sent a letter to leaders citing “verified, widely circulated stories of inappropriate sexual behavior amongst staff/interns,” and characterized Hillsong as “dangerous and a breeding ground for unchecked abuse.” The letter references an unnamed church leader who had “multiple inappropriate sexual relationships with several female leaders and volunteers and was verbally, emotionally, and according to one woman, physically abusive in his relationships with these women.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the allegations levied against Hillsong in FX’s new docuseries expand beyond sexual abuse: Lentz acknowledges deep institutionalized racism that prevented anyone but white men from assuming leadership positions within the international church, while one of Hillsong’s few Black female congregants in Kansas City recalls in the docuseries that she was once physically removed from the church by police when church leaders learned she had spoken out against lacking diversity in the organization. The woman is one of several Black women to allege racial discrimination within the church in the docuseries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cults are rotten all the way through, as demonstrated by IBLP and Hillsong, but somehow their followers are so fervent and sincere, even as they are exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">They are a savage breed of subhumans, roaming the globe in search of victims. They dig up graves, they lurk about hospitals, all for an opportunity to snatch up a skull or two to mount in their collections, where other members of the tribe meet to admire each other’s stolen heads. One of the <a href="https://www.sapiens.org/biology/finding-ceremony-morton-collection-repatriation/">kings of the headhunters was Samuel George Morton</a>, who collected vast numbers of ghoulish remains.</p>
<blockquote><p>The trafficking of remains belonging to other people’s ancestors dominated Morton’s correspondence. On February 3, 1837, Bostonian Dr. John Collins Warren, an early leader in surgical education in the United States and the first dean of Harvard’s Medical School, wrote to his Philadelphia colleague, Morton, asking, “Have you the Guanche? If not, I can let you have a head.” A couple months later, Warren sent Morton the “head,” along with a brief anecdote about how his friend found and stole it for him.</p>
<p>Today that skull of an Indigenous person from the Canary Islands, Dr. Warren’s gift to Dr. Morton, sits on a wooden shelf in an old cabinet in the basement of the Penn Museum. On those same shelves, in those same cabinets, sit crania of people from other parts of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, this wasn’t just about frivolously turning a museum into a Hallowe’en haunted house. They had a higher purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p>Warren and Morton are just two examples of the depraved history of trafficking in the skulls of our ancestors as part of the larger racial science project of the European Enlightenment to “prove” the superiority of the white race. This laid the groundwork for the way that race operates in the present.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. Somehow, introducing “science” into the phenomenon just makes it worse.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just an archaic 19th century hobby, either. More recent remains have been collected.</p>
<blockquote><p>The presence of Black Philadelphians in the Morton Cranial Collection—the same individuals who Penn now seeks to bury—was surfaced by a report written by a Penn graduate student in February 2021. In late April 2021, one of the authors reported that the remains of Black children who were their neighbors, who were murdered in the 1985 MOVE bombing, were sitting in a box in the same museum basement. These remains were used as teaching material for an online course.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder what they learned from those bones? Morton’s own science has been thoroughly discredited — he believed that the different races of humans had all been created independently by god, no dark-skinned progenitors in his ancestry, for sure! — and I don’t know what anyone learned by throwing the bones of children killed in a crime into a box.</p>
<p>I’m fine with and see the utility of research and training on cadavers, but they have to be willingly donated, not looted from a grave site. They also have to be treated with respect. The University of Pennsylvania is currently trying to get rid of the skeletons in their closets by rushing to bury them, without doing the appropriate research to identify the bodies they snatched.</p>
<p>I’m left with one question, though. I know where Morton’s grave is — it’s in Laurel Hill cemetery in Philadelphia.</p>

I walked into the room in the morning to find a lake of blood turning dark brown, full of fibrous clots, and the poor dog dead in the middle of it. I don’t know why I suddenly thought of that.

<p>That’s the current state of anti-trans legislation in the US, a spreading pool of hate oozing up the middle of the country. Florida has already gone necrotic. </p>
<p>They also have maps of the legislative status in 2022 and 2023 where you can see the reds darkening over time as the evil spreads — you can also see that Minnesota has been getting bluer, at least. There’s a sickness in this country that is getting worse.</p>

    <title>The tiny particle that could answer big questions</title>

The DUNE project will investigate the neutrino &amp;ndash; the tiniest of fundamental particles, meaning &amp;ldquo;the little neutral one&amp;rdquo; in Italian. It is being constructed one mile deep below Sanford Lab in South Dakota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neutrinos are so tiny that they barely interact with anything and simply glide straight through you, through the Earth and out the other side. But these particles have a mighty role to play in helping us understand some of the most fundamental questions in physics: What is the origin of matter and why is there an imbalance of matter and anti-matter? Is there a grand unifying theory that connects all forces? How do black holes form?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 scientists and engineers, from 200 labs and universities across 30 countries, are collaborating to build DUNE in the hope it will reveal key information about this mysterious particle. The DUNE experiment starts with an underground particle accelerator, where particles will smash into a target to generate an intense beam of neutrinos that will travel through the ground towards the detectors. That&amp;rsquo;s the easy part. The real challenge is in the design and construction of huge, highly complex detector systems that are capable of seeing a particle that doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each of four detector modules will be a liquid-argon chamber filled with 17,000 tons of argon. Neutrinos colliding with argon atoms will produce charged particles that in turn knock out electrons that will be detected by 150 2.3m x 6m units of tightly-wound copper beryllium wires, thus providing a signal that can be recorded as neutrino data. And now the DUNE collaboration has announced the exciting news that mass production for this first, colossal detector module has started, after a series of successful prototype tests at CERN.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Criminalisation of abortion endangers women and girls - including in the UK</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Image credit: Bret Kavanaugh/Unsplash" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bret-kavanaugh-MIfUp3FA5ek-unsplash.jpg" height="912" alt="An empty hospital bed" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reversal of Roe v Wade in the United States last year sent shockwaves throughout the world. As some states moved to criminalise abortion, there was outcry against the idea of pregnant women being treated as criminals for exerting agency over their own bodies. But, as a new report from researchers at the World Health Organization (WHO) makes clear, criminalisation of abortion is the norm, not the exception, globally. Of the 182 countries for which there was data as of October 2022, abortion was completely decriminalised in just one: Canada. Penalties range from fines to, in a handful of countries, life imprisonment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the UK there is a widespread belief that abortion is not a crime. In England, Scotland and Wales, the procedure is legal if authorised by two doctors before 24 weeks&amp;rsquo; gestation, or in cases where there are serious health risks to continuing the pregnancy. But it remains criminalised outside these parameters under legislation passed in 1861.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, at least two women were charged with abortion-related offences in England, both for allegedly taking abortion pills after the 24-week limit. One of the cases was dropped after prosecutors agreed it was not in the public interest to pursue it; the other woman pled guilty to unlawfully administering a poison or noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage, an offence under the 1861 law, and is awaiting sentencing. This year, already, at least two more people have been charged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dozens of women have also been investigated over the past decade, according to a recent report in the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;. Some were arrested in their hospital beds; at least one was jailed. A girl as young as 15 had her phone and laptop confiscated, for investigation, during her GCSE exams. Police produced text exchanges with her boyfriend, where she expressed doubt over having the baby, as evidence against her, before a coroner concluded that the pregnancy had ended due to natural causes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Northern Ireland maintained a near-total ban on abortions until 2020, when Westminster took advantage of the collapse of Stormont&amp;rsquo;s power-sharing deal to intervene. There are still 11 countries &amp;ndash; including Andorra and Malta &amp;ndash; where abortion is prohibited in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The great irony of these laws is that they don&amp;rsquo;t reduce abortions. A study in 2020 from researchers at the Guttmacher Institute and WHO found that the abortion rate was the same in countries where it was &amp;ldquo;broadly legal&amp;rdquo; as in those where it was completely banned. Meanwhile, even partial criminalisation can be dangerous, because it can discourage or delay women from seeking safe abortions and cause health workers to be overly cautious, even to the point of denying legal forms of care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evidence is clear: criminalisation only serves to limit safe and regulated abortions, while putting women and girls at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a preview from New Humanist's summer 2023 issue. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Malaria vaccine: A scientific victory</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6116/malaria-vaccine-a-scientific-victory#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Diana Polekhina on Unsplash" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/diana-polekhina-ZBstHWt9vLc-unsplash.jpg" height="850" alt="A stock photo of a syringe containing a yellow liquid" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Ghana became the first country in the world to approve a highly effective malaria vaccine, an achievement 80 years in the making. Known as R21, it is the first for malaria &amp;ndash; or indeed any parasitic disease &amp;ndash; to exceed the World Health Organization&amp;rsquo;s 75 per cent efficacy target. Parasites are much more complex than viruses or bacteria, so this is a major breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Preliminary results from final-stage trials have not yet been published, but Ghana has already cleared the vaccine for use in children aged 5-36 months &amp;ndash; the group at highest risk of death from malaria. Nigeria followed suit shortly afterwards. The WHO is still reviewing the data to determine whether it will recommend the vaccine for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge of targeting the malaria parasite is that it changes its structure throughout its lifecycle. R21 targets the parasite at a very early stage, before it has spread extensively throughout the body. This rapid response is helped along by an &amp;ldquo;adjuvant&amp;rdquo; (an ingredient that boosts the body&amp;rsquo;s immune response to vaccines) called Matrix-M, which comes from the Chilean soapbark tree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another major obstacle has been funding. Pharmaceuticals typically invest in vaccines expecting to recoup the costs by selling them to wealthy countries. But malaria mostly affects lower-income countries. R21 was developed by researchers at Oxford University&amp;rsquo;s Jenner Institute, which also developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19. Their work was supported by awards from the European Commission, UK Research and Innovation, the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Serum Institute of India, among others. According to Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, it is the first major vaccine to be approved by an African country before rich nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new vaccine is no silver bullet. Doubts remain about the reported efficacy as trials continue, and about the practicalities of delivery, as it requires three initial doses and possibly boosters, which can be a challenge in rural areas. Funding for a widespread rollout also remains an issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, R21 marks a major scientific advancement and brings significant hope in the fight against one of the world&amp;rsquo;s deadliest diseases. It comes on the back of two decades of impressive progress against malaria, mainly through the use of antimalarial drugs, insecticides and nets. The disease has already been eliminated in 15 countries since 2000. Global eradication once seemed impossible. Increasingly, it looks like a practical aim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>An assault on our rights</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6115/an-assault-on-our-rights#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Medical staff block Lambeth Bridge, London, during a climate protest. Credit: Alisdare Hickson" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Stop_Financing_Fossil_Fuels__51997248014_-credit-Alisdare-Hickson.jpg" height="1080" alt="A group of medical professionals block Lambeth Bridge in London to protest against fossil fuel extraction" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; went to press last week, the Public Order Act had just become law, introducing new police powers to restrict protests in the UK. It comes on the back of high-profile demonstrations in recent years that have seen groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Black Lives Matter take actions such as blocking roads, airports and printing presses in a bid to raise public awareness and push politicians into action. Some of the new restrictions came into effect just days before the coronation of King Charles III, ahead of anticipated anti-monarchy protests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government says it &amp;ldquo;fully supports the right of individuals to engage in peaceful protest&amp;rdquo; but that the &amp;ldquo;guerrilla tactics&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;serious disruption caused by a small minority of protestors has highlighted that more needs to be done to protect the public and businesses from these unacceptable actions.&amp;rdquo; But if Rishi Sunak and his party &amp;ldquo;fully support&amp;rdquo; the right to protest, they&amp;rsquo;re doing an impressive job of hiding it. They already introduced new restrictions last year, under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. That act increased the instances in which police could intervene in protests. Intentionally &amp;ldquo;causing a public nuisance&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; an offence which could cover peaceful actions like blocking the entrance to a building, or occupying a public space &amp;ndash; is now punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and the jailing of peaceful protesters has already begun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new law goes further again. It introduces new criminal offences, including &amp;ldquo;locking on&amp;rdquo;, where protestors chain themselves to buildings or objects, a tactic that was famously used by the suffragettes in the 1900s. That is now punishable by up to six months in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also newly criminalised are &amp;ldquo;obstructing major transport works&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;interfering with key national infrastructure&amp;rdquo; (the government has specifically mentioned airports and printing presses, both of which have been the sites of climate protests), and &amp;ldquo;tunnelling&amp;rdquo;, which is defined as &amp;ldquo;creating&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;being present&amp;rdquo; in a tunnel, &amp;ldquo;where such an act is causing or capable of causing serious disruption&amp;rdquo;. This last offence seems to specifically target anti-HS2 protesters, some of whom have occupied tunnels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law also allows magistrates to ban particular people from attending protests, and extends police powers, allowing officers to stop and search people without suspicion of any wrongdoing in and near protest sites. Under normal circumstances, police generally need to have &amp;ldquo;reasonable grounds&amp;rdquo; to suspect that someone is carrying an illegal item or something that could be used to commit a crime in order to stop and search them. Even then, the racial discrimination involved in that assessment of suspicion is well known and there is little evidence that it is an effective tool to fight crime. These efforts to pre-emptively clamp down on protests are deeply concerning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lords rejected some of the most serious provisions &amp;ndash; including a government bid to restrict the use of the right to protest on &amp;ldquo;an issue of current debate&amp;rdquo; as a defence in court. But this is not enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human rights organisations, and some politicians and lawyers, have condemned the law as an assault on democratic freedoms. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T&amp;uuml;rk, called on the government to reverse the legislation. The new law imposes &amp;ldquo;disproportionate criminal sanctions on people organising or taking part in peaceful protests,&amp;rdquo; he said, and is &amp;ldquo;wholly unnecessary as UK police already have the powers to act against violent and disruptive demonstrations&amp;rdquo;. Four UN special rapporteurs on rights have also expressed &amp;ldquo;grave concerns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is, unfortunately, little chance that the government will pay any attention to the international outcry. This regressive law is likely here to stay, with far-reaching consequences for our democracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
