<p>Either that, or he is a liar.</p>
<p>It is most weird how some people get worked up over a simple, non-judgmental descriptor. There is no opprobrium attached to being cis — in fact, it’s a social advantage. So what has got these people irate?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the implicit acknowledgment that if cis people exist, then trans people do, too.</p>

    <title>Learning from history is a good idea</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/06/28/learning-from-history-is-a-good-idea/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Have you ever felt like you spend all your time explaining the obvious to idiots who are going to reflexively reject the evidence anyway? That’s the discouraging thing about battling creationism, you’re fighting willful ignorance. Even more significant is the need to explain the importance of vaccines when we’ve got <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/contrarian-defenses-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr-arent-brave-theyre-boring?ref=home">mush-brained cranks like RFK Jr.</a> geysering nonsense into the discourse that the media treats gently as if he has something intelligent to say.</p>
<p>This has always been a problem, though. Today I learned that <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1670812548814258181.html">Minnesota had mandatory vaccination laws for school children in 1883 (Yay! Woo-hoo! You go, Minnesota!) but that they repealed it in 1903 (booooo)</a> after…a debate. </p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/ACV-Society-debate.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/ACV-Society-debate.png" alt="" width="462" height="588" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70551" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/ACV-Society-debate.png 462w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/ACV-Society-debate-118x150.png 118w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/ACV-Society-debate-236x300.png 236w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px"/></a></p>
<p>Fucking debates. Anyway, they dragged Justus Ohage, a real physician and the public health commissioner for St Paul into a debate with a carpet-bagger from Indiana, WB Clarke, who proceeded to glibly gish-gallup all over the place.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Clarke spoke next for an hour. He called Edward Jenner’s research “bogus.” He threw out incorrect and cherry-picked examples. He claimed that Germany had compulsory vaccination but also had the worst smallpox outbreak in Europe in 1871…<br/>
He did not mention that the smallpox epidemic was caused by unvaccinated French troops in Germany fighting in the Franco-Prussian War and that the vaccinated Germans suffered far less than the French.<br/>
There was no way for anyone to rebut these claims as he was making them, and Clarke was a smooth talker. He spoke quickly and vividly ultimately comparing the “vaccinator’s lancet” to a “highwayman’s butcher knife” saying that people had a right to defend themselves against each.<br/>
When Dr. Ohage took the stage, he only had 15 minutes. He said he did not have time to offer a rebuttal of each of Clarke’s claims. Instead, he had to defend “the attitude he had taken” against the anti-vaccinationists. The damage was done.</p></blockquote>
<p>The result: the Minnesota legislature repealed the mandatory vaccination law in 1903.</p>
<p>Wait, no, that was only the proximate result. The long-term consequence was that <a href="https://www.mnopedia.org/event/smallpox-epidemic-1924-1925">Minnesota was ravaged by a smallpox epidemic in 1924-25</a> that killed 500 people. Oops.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/anti-vax-cost.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/anti-vax-cost-500x518.png" alt="" width="500" height="518" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70552" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/anti-vax-cost-500x518.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/anti-vax-cost-145x150.png 145w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/anti-vax-cost-289x300.png 289w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/anti-vax-cost.png 651w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a></p>
<blockquote><p>State law blocked a sound public health response. An 1883 state law had required all school-age children to be vaccinated against smallpox. But in 1903, the legislature repealed that law and made compulsory child vaccination illegal. Although smallpox vaccination is almost 100 percent effective, public health officers had no power to make people protect themselves. They could recommend, but not mandate, the vaccine.</p>
<p>Starting in November 1924, both cities launched free vaccination campaigns. Once the deaths mounted, the frightened public jammed the vaccination centers. As reported in the Minneapolis Journal, as many as 17,000 got their skin scratches in a single day. By mid-December 1924—according to public health officials—some 210,000 people in St. Paul and 350,000 in Minneapolis had been vaccinated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clarke was never called to account for all the people he was responsible for killing. The sheep of Minnesota were cheerfully duped by a smooth-talking liar, and stampeded into the vaccination clinics to save themselves from their own stupidity.</p>
<p>It’s 1902 in the United States all over again. I’ll make the bold prediction that in 20 years or less we’re going to have to pay the piper.</p>

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Sorry to ruin your day…don&amp;#8217;t watch this if you&amp;#8217;d rather not. This is the &lt;a href="https://angrywhitemen.org/2023/06/26/white-nationalist-jared-taylor-links-opposition-to-lgbtq-rights-with-white-racial-consciousness/"&gt;horrible Jared Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, professional bigot, jumping on the anti-trans bandwagon. He hates black people and gays, so adding another category to his long list is not a stretch for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='640' height='360' src='https://video.wordpress.com/embed/DGzc20OD?cover=1&amp;amp;autoPlay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;muted=0&amp;amp;persistVolume=1&amp;amp;playsinline=0&amp;amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;amp;useAverageColor=1&amp;amp;hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent="true"  allow='clipboard-write'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1674852142'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When someone’s sexual energy — and we have a lot of it — is wasted on a reproductive dead end, that’s a defect,” Taylor said. “Biologically it’s no different from wanting to copulate with lawn mowers, or animals, or dead people. Just because same-sex attraction is more common, doesn’t mean it’s not a defect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Homosexuals are different,” he continued. “They don’t want to be treated just like everyone else. They want us to think they’re special. And better. They want to be noticed and celebrated. Adored, even. It’s like being Black: We must never forget that people used to give them a hard time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It comes as a shock to a lot of Americans, but whom you copulate with, when, and why are not your business alone,” he asserted. “Every society sets rules, because without rules society collapses. Healthy societies have rules that are meant to build families and promote child-rearing. They grow out of an ancient sense of duty to family, nation, and race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor claimed that the “homo-tranny-drag queen stuff is the very opposite” and that the “strongest opposition to it comes from religious groups and racially conscious people.” And he said that “every gain in white racial consciousness is a victory for families and sound sexual behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to say that, “You cannot have white awareness without understanding that healthy families are the key to our survival. And anyone willing to fight the madness and stand up for healthy families is half-way to an understanding of race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t be like Jared Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">You can entertain yourself by reading the responses to a <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/06/24/moral-panics-and-the-bigoted-subversion-of-biology/comment-page-1/#comment-2184398">transphobic troll on the Coyne &amp; Maroja thread</a>. I won’t bother with most of it — the commenters have been doing a fine cleanup job — but their first objection is a major peeve.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Biological sex is a binary defining reproductive roles/potential. It doesn’t govern behaviour, it doesn’t tell you who you can sleep with, it doesn’t deny the existence of trans people. The day a testicle produces ova or an ovary produces sperm there may be an argument for rethinking it, but dishonestly claiming that it has any more relevance than that does not alter reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first words annoy me. <q>Biological sex</q>…what other kind is there? They then go on to claim that sex is <em>only</em> about reproduction, a surprise to me. I guess they only have procreative sex then, and are unaware of all the other ways humans use sex. It’s just eggs and sperm, nothing else, and reducing it to single cells interacting with each other is the extreme they have to go to if they’re going to fit it all into a small, simple, binary box.</p>
<p>I also have to wonder who the hell is arguing about testicles producing ova? This is so typical, the ‘phobes inventing claims nobody is making so they can “win” ridiculous debates.</p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Lately, I’ve been getting a flood of spam about “tentmaking”. It’s not what it sounds like — it’s an <a href="https://worldwidetentmakers.com/education/what-is-a-tentmaker/">evangelical Christian term</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Today Tentmaking has taken on a much broader definition than just referring to the skill of making tents.  <strong>A Tentmaker is a dedicated, spiritually mature Christian man or woman who views work in light of the Great Commission and as an opportunity to serve the Kingdom of God.</strong>  Therefore, work is a vital aspect of Christian witness because it provides substantial means of developing relationships, credibility, and contexts for ministry.  </p></blockquote>

<p>I’ve got a bunch of these in the trash right now — the curious thing is that none of them talk about god or Jesus, although they do use words like “side-hustle” and making thousands of dollars per week in your spare time. I think Jesus is the side-hustle here.</p>
<p>I’ve snipped out the contact information, but if you’re really excited about the possibilities, contact me and I’ll let you know. By the way, the workshop will only cost you $497, although they drop hints about additional upgrades.</p>
<p>This is what Christianity has become — a grifter’s refuge.</p>

    <title>Book review: Mussolini in Myth and Memory</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Mussolini in 1935. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Mussolini.jpg" height="1007" alt="Benito Mussolini stands on a podium in 1935" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mussolini in Myth and Memory: The First Totalitarian Dictator&lt;/strong&gt; (Oxford University Press) by Paul Corner&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United States is not the only democracy flirting with the idea of destroying itself. Russians, Romanians, Italians &amp;ndash; people from all over the world are falling back in love with dictators and dictatorships they fervently rejected not too long ago. Joseph Stalin, declared a criminal by his successors, is now being depicted alongside Vladimir Putin as a strong, feared leader. Nicolae Ceaușescu, who upon his arrest was executed as quickly as possible so he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be lynched by his own followers, was remembered favourably by 65 per cent of Romanians, according to a 2018 survey. Even Benito Mussolini, whose mutilated body was hung upside down at the Piazzale Loreto in Milan, somehow managed to gain the sympathy of the children and grandchildren of the Italians who celebrated his death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How did we get here? Using Italy as a case study, Paul Corner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Mussolini in Myth and Memory &lt;/em&gt;argues it all comes down to collective memory, the way it forms and is manipulated. Faced with problems like economic recession, political instability and changing social norms, people seek refuge in &amp;ldquo;phantom utopias&amp;rdquo;: augmented versions of the past in which memories of violence and suppression are themselves suppressed. Corner builds on ideas introduced by Russian sociologist Lev Gudkov (&amp;ldquo;Soviet ideological slogans get reborn in the mass consciousness, but are mistaken for a reality &amp;ndash; a phantom utopia &amp;ndash; that never existed&amp;rdquo;) and filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini (&amp;ldquo;We are a country without memory, which is like saying without history. Italy removes its recent past&amp;hellip; keeping only those memories, those fragments that might be useful for its contortions, its conversions&amp;rdquo;) to create an original, insightful study of the 20th century and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each chapter identifies a popular misconception about Mussolini&amp;rsquo;s rule, discerns the purpose it serves in present-day Italy and gathers historical evidence to show why it is incorrect. Examples include: Mussolini made the trains run on time; Mussolini destroyed the mafia; siding with Nazi Germany was Mussolini&amp;rsquo;s one key mistake; and Mussolini alone bears responsibility for Italy&amp;rsquo;s actions before and during the Second World War. The notion that Mussolini reduced crime betrays frustration with the slow-moving administration of justice in bureaucratic democracies, just as the belief that Mussolini introduced pensions is rooted in financial insecurity. In truth, writes Corner, there is no evidence to suggest he made Italy less criminal, and while his regime did extend pensions, the foundations of those systems were put in place long before he rose to power. The misconception that Mussolini is responsible for Italy&amp;rsquo;s actions is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it absolves Italians from the guilt of the war crimes they committed. On the other, it reinforces the image of Mussolini as all-powerful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Corner admittedly focuses more on the past than the present &amp;ndash; a bit disappointing considering the book&amp;rsquo;s title promises readers they will learn how the former is contained in the latter. Instead of merely reframing the work of other historians, it would have been fitting to see him devote a bit more time and energy to those aspects that make&lt;em&gt; Mussolini in Myth and Memory&lt;/em&gt; unique. But popular opinion on Mussolini &amp;ndash; or any other subject &amp;ndash; is difficult to pin down without resorting to surveys and statistical research, which would have slowed the book&amp;rsquo;s arresting pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to get a better understanding of the rise, fall and persistence of fascism, this is a good book to start with. Corner&amp;rsquo;s central theme of collective memory and phantom utopias gives the reader a theoretical framework through which to organise information provided by other, more conventional studies. Corner, who served as the director of the Centre for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes in Siena, is doing more than fact-checking fake news. His is a study of how fake news &amp;ndash; for lack of a better term &amp;ndash; enters the world and warps it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here for access to the full magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>What supporting my father through Alzheimer's taught me</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'Old Man in Sorrow' by Vincent van Gogh. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/CRKX0E.jpg" height="1890" alt="'Old Man in Sorrow' by Vincent van Gogh" width="1519"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In November 1901 a woman named Auguste Deter was admitted to the Municipal Asylum for Epileptics and Lunatics in Frankfurt. She was 51 years old. Paranoid delusions about her husband&amp;rsquo;s fidelity had given way to amnesia and disorientation; she failed to recognise old friends and forgot life&amp;rsquo;s daily occurrences the moment they were past. Soon she was unable to look after herself entirely. &amp;ldquo;I have lost myself,&amp;rdquo; she told her 36-year-old physician. His name was Dr Alois Alzheimer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer was that rare thing at the turn of the 20th century, a doctor with an interest in both psychiatry, the workings of the mind, and histology, the study of cell tissue and structure. When he examined Deter&amp;rsquo;s brain after her eventual death in 1906, he found it alarmingly atrophied, abnormally light. Then, looking at it under the microscope, he saw two things he had never seen before. First, the buildup of a brain protein named beta-amyloid into what are known as &amp;ldquo;senile plaques&amp;rdquo;; second, dense tangles of fibrils within the brain&amp;rsquo;s cells that had gone rogue, as it were, choking and ultimately destroying the cells themselves. The damage was greatest where the tangles and the plaques coincided. As many as a third of the cells in Deter&amp;rsquo;s cerebral cortex were destroyed or damaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it seems paradoxical that one of the definitive diseases of old age should have been first identified in someone much younger, Alzheimer himself regarded his discovery as a disease of middle age and entirely distinct from senile dementia. It was a view that held until the 1970s, when it became clear that they were essentially the same phenomenon; the neurologist Robert Katzman showed that Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s was one of the leading causes of death in the US, its presence in the deceased elided by a wide range of more immediately catastrophic health events recorded on the death certificate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow it seems apt for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s to be hiding in plain sight like that. It is after all a disease of deception, its presence masked in the patient by the general cognitive decline that we all experience once we pass the age of 50 or so. This can be compounded by the patient&amp;rsquo;s own unwillingness or inability to recognise or acknowledge the disease as it encroaches, and by the person&amp;rsquo;s stubborn, desperate retention of routine and behaviour &amp;ndash; even while memory and, arguably, identity crumble around them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My father died of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s three days after his 90th birthday in May 2016. He had been admitted with sepsis four days earlier, but his renal functions had been failing, resulting in repeated spells in hospital, since the previous autumn. There was one long spell of about a month in the spring from which he never really rallied. All semblance of independent life ended. There were four 15-minute visits from health workers spread across the empty plain of the day, and then soon a nurse staying overnight in case he accidentally pulled his catheter out &amp;ndash; and, more generally, to comfort a newfound panic that overwhelmed him when he was alone, particularly at night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t have been much more than a week into this new restricted life that he stopped coming downstairs, or even getting out of bed. He ate less and less. By this time he was incontinent as well as cathetered and had lost any sense of the indignity of the experience, lost his sense of privacy, of decency, of inhibition. He would have been appalled, had he known. He was, I would have said, a proud man; he wanted to live in his home of 50 years on his own terms. The change was disorienting. A few weeks earlier, in hospital, he had to be physically restrained by two security guards to stop him discharging himself against medical advice. Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards were invoked. He was sedated. Most of that fight seemed to have drained away. It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to say that he gave up the ghost: it implies a degree of agency and choice on his part, and the dignity that goes with a sense of volition. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know if that is actually true; but it is comforting, in a small way, to think it might be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The role of loneliness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Memory plays tricks on all of us. Or rather, we conspire with it in a process that psychologists call &amp;ldquo;coherence&amp;rdquo;, shaping memories to fit narratives we find more comfortable, or that accommodate our present sense of self better. My recollection is that Dad&amp;rsquo;s difficulties date to the last couple of years of his life, but going back through the emails between myself and my three siblings to research this piece, I see that we had serious concerns about his memory at least as far back as 2011. Perhaps I want to avoid thinking about ways in which those last years might have been better for him. Perhaps we should have pushed him harder to recognise his predicament. But would the emotional distress, never mind the potential of ruptured familial relationships, have been worth the cost? It is not as if it is a disease with a cure. Perhaps he was already, in some senses, unreachable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our mother had died of esophageal cancer early in 2009, and grief, loneliness and depression weighed heavily on my father. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it was a sorrow he ever had the wherewithal to adapt to, never mind overcome. He was prescribed citalopram, an anti-depressant, but we were never sure how reliably he took it. We were never sure how reliably he took any medication in those years. He bristled at the intrusion whenever we enquired; the irritation, touched with defensiveness, was entirely in character, but I wonder now how much that kind of sensitivity, possibly extending to resentment, was related to the Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s. The hippocampus nestles beside the amygdala in the brain, and the amygdala regulates the great primal emotions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was a function of the disease too, then, that he seemed to be more emotional about Mum&amp;rsquo;s loss the longer it receded into the past. When we all met on the anniversary of Mum&amp;rsquo;s death, or on her birthday, on the hillside where we had scattered her ashes, Dad took to throwing himself to the ground and kissing the earth where the ashes had fallen. Hitherto, he had been among the most reserved of people; the only time I ever saw him express intense physical affection for Mum was at her death, when he showered her cold face with kisses and sobbed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking back now, I can see that Dad&amp;rsquo;s situation was fertile ground for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s to take root in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sandeep Jauhar&amp;rsquo;s new book, &lt;em&gt;My Father&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/em&gt;, is a moving account of his father&amp;rsquo;s illness and eventual death. Like my own father, Jauhar&amp;rsquo;s had lost his wife a few years earlier; like Dad, too, he had a successful career in which intellect played a key role. He cites a 2007 study which suggests there is a strong correlation between loneliness and the development of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s; and another, from 2020, which found that the recently widowed decline mentally three times as quickly as those who have not experienced such wrenching, disabling griefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish I had known about that correlation. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know how easy it would have been to make use of it. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes said that Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s destroys the self. Ultimately, perhaps, it does, if the patient lives long enough to reach the final stage where the disease attacks not just memory but motor function, the ability to undertake such fundamental tasks as swallowing. Dad died before he reached that extremity. I think we must be grateful for that. In one moment of clarity in those last weeks, he described the disease to me as a kind of hollowing out; he said he looked inside himself and found a blackness, as if what remained of memory and the self clung vertiginously to the outer limits of his identity. I think it terrified him. Looking back, though, what feels remarkable is not the loss of self, but its persistence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Memory and the self&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The relationship between memory and the self has long been argued over. Jauhar notes the 18th-century philosopher David Hume&amp;rsquo;s observation in his &lt;em&gt;A Treatise of Human Nature&lt;/em&gt; that &amp;ldquo;Had we no memory, we never should have any notion of causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and effects, which constitute our self or person.&amp;rdquo; Late in life the surrealist film maker Luis Bu&amp;ntilde;uel wrote poignantly in his memoir &lt;em&gt;My Last Breath&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;You have to begin to lose your memory, if only in bits and pieces, to realise that memory is what makes our lives. Life without memory is no life&amp;hellip; Our memory is our coherence, our reason, our feeling, even our action. Without it, we are nothing.&amp;rdquo; But are we only the sum of our own memories? Does the self only have meaning in terms of the interior life? &amp;ldquo;The conventional paradigm about what constitutes a person does not give adequate import to the richness of a human being outside of his cognitive capacities,&amp;rdquo; Jauhar writes. &amp;ldquo;Human beings exist not only in an inner world but also in a public space. It is that space that continues to give meaning to the lives of people living with severe dementia.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an idea also explored in another new book on the subject, Dasha Kiper&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Travellers to Unimaginable Lands&lt;/em&gt;, a psychologically acute and compelling series of case studies exploring the relationship between the carer and the dementia patient. &amp;ldquo;The notion that there is a part of ourselves that is entirely separate from others is most likely a fiction,&amp;rdquo; she writes. There is no &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo; that is distinct from &amp;ldquo;how people see us&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Neurologically speaking, there is no special place in the brain that is hermetically sealed from the influence of other people. Quite the contrary: the self is porous.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A related theme in Kiper&amp;rsquo;s book resonated powerfully with me: the idea that Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s is emotionally and mentally disabling for the carer, as well as the patient. &amp;ldquo;We simply have no cognitive framework that allows for [memory&amp;rsquo;s] absence in others,&amp;rdquo; she writes. &amp;ldquo;Human beings did not evolve to function in isolation, and in fact each person&amp;rsquo;s cognition is dependent on the cognitive faculties of those around them. So when one person&amp;rsquo;s memory is impaired, those close to him or her also become disoriented.&amp;rdquo; That is, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s bends the world to its rhythms and processes. It&amp;rsquo;s quite totalitarian in this regard. Alternate realities &amp;ndash; narratives, perspectives, points of view &amp;ndash; are not viable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Extraordinary intimacies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To accompany a loved one into the horror of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s is to negotiate extraordinary intimacies at the limit of human experience to which you are the only witness. You have to keep privately reminding yourself what is occurring, what has occurred. Your memory of events becomes a kind of private resistance to the disease. But in the public space between you and the patient, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s obliterates you too. Faced, say, with endlessly repeated questions or statements, you can tell the truth and say, &amp;ldquo;We just talked about that&amp;rdquo;. But it won&amp;rsquo;t change the sequence of events. Or you can acquiesce, play the game as it were, and respond to each moment as if it is new to you too. Either way, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s wins. Its reality trumps your reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the end,&amp;rdquo; a neurologist tells Jauhar, &amp;ldquo;all dementias look alike. The whole brain is affected. Patients generally can&amp;rsquo;t speak.&amp;rdquo; But the journey to that end is surely unique &amp;ndash; or as unique as the person for whom you are caring, as unique as your relationship with them. In the same way as my relationship with my dad was not the same as his with each of my siblings, however much common ground we shared, I am sure my experience of his Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s was different, because it was grounded in the deep memory of our prior history. Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s strips away almost everything that is individual. But even when language and memory failed Dad the most, there were still the bare, non-verbal, human things of touch and companionship, comfort and care which we gave him, each as we could: a kind of somatic continuity to counterbalance the strobing discontinuous struggle of surviving as each brief moment of existence flashed past unremarked to make way for the next. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it mattered to him; it felt very much like it did. What does it matter if he didn&amp;rsquo;t remember afterwards?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s, writes David Shenk in his classic study &lt;em&gt;The Forgetting&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;ldquo;is not only a disease, but also a prism through which we can view life in a way not normally available to us&amp;hellip; it forces us to experience death in a way it is rarely otherwise experienced&amp;hellip; It is more painful than many people can even imagine, but it is also perhaps the most poignant of all reminders of why and how human life is so extraordinary. It is our best lens on the meaning of loss.&amp;rdquo; We are social animals. We need community, even if that is a community of two people. We need reciprocity, a sense of the shared moment. But reciprocity requires a mutual understanding. What happens then if there is only one person to understand, to remember?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a historian, as a writer, I think a lot about memory and erasure, memory and loss. Absences in the record. The value of testimony. The sense of my father&amp;rsquo;s life &amp;ndash; all those unshared, unwritten memories flaking away, falling into oblivion in those last months, perhaps years &amp;ndash; was almost palpable. But if the self is not limited to the individual memory, if it is in some senses a shared construct, a shared endeavour, then it is important to rescue what can still be rescued, and not to write off the ends of life, to compound one erasure with another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the 20th century there was a sometimes vituperative debate about the historiography of the Holocaust. Put very crudely, the argument was about whether it is possible even to write history about such a subject: narrative history is inevitably selective, cohering to an argument, and ultimately a kind of falsification, the thinking runs. Critics of this position saw it as an attack on the status of survivor testimony that opened the door to Holocaust revisionism and denial. The Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg&amp;rsquo;s contribution was an essay titled &amp;ldquo;Just One Witness&amp;rdquo;. He begins by citing the extermination of the entire Jewish community in a village in Provence in 1348, in the wake of the Black Death, for which the only evidence now is the written memory of a single survivor. We cannot, as historians, disregard such testimony, he argues, even if there is nothing reciprocal in the record to confirm it. It exists; we must make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That essay, or its core sentiment, has been rattling around my head writing this. For all the grinding bewilderment and exhaustion of those months, there is a kind of privilege to care for someone in these straits. A privilege to travel with someone into such a bleak, strange part of human existence. To travel with them, and bring the last of them back with you. Two people, one supporting the other. One community of two. One witness. One love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Could nuclear fusion save the planet?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6132/could-nuclear-fusion-save-the-planet#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Nuclear fusion is the power source of the sun and the stars. Image credit: Andrey Grinkevich" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/andrey-grinkevich-0x6RTts1jRU-unsplash.jpg" height="1080" alt="A bright yellow sun rises over mountains in Nevada" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of excitement lately about harnessing nuclear fusion, the power source of the sun and stars, and so gaining access to limitless green energy. Is it all hype? Well, put it this way. The joke since the 1950s has been that commercial fusion is always 50 years away. Now it appears to be only 30 years away!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what is this promising process, able to produce abundant energy without greenhouse gases? Readers may be more familiar with nuclear fission, the process behind the atomic bomb and nuclear reactors, which involves splitting the core, or &amp;ldquo;nucleus&amp;rdquo;, of a heavy atom, to make lighter nuclei. In nuclear fusion, light nuclei are melded together to make a heavier one. When light nuclei like hydrogen fuse, or heavy nuclei like uranium split, surplus energy gushes out. Pound for pound, a nuclear fuel contains at least a million times as much energy as a &amp;ldquo;chemical fuel&amp;rdquo; like coal or oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why nuclear fusion is so attractive, but let&amp;rsquo;s look at the practicalities. The sun fuses hydrogen into helium, with the by-product being sunlight, but the reaction is far too slow for use on Earth. Instead, the focus has been on gluing together deuterium (a heavy form of hydrogen that is readily available in seawater) with tritium (an even heavier but fast-decaying form, which has to be created by artificial nuclear reactions).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difficulty with fusion is that light nuclei like hydrogen need to be slammed together extremely violently in order to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion, which is ferocious. Such collisions in practice occur only at an extremely high temperature. But, whereas the fusion of hydrogen in the sun requires a temperature of 15 million degrees, the fusion of deuterium and tritium requires a temperature of more than 100 million degrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And herein lies the problem. How do you generate such extraordinary temperatures on Earth without destroying everything in the vicinity?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are two main approaches. One is to confine a super-hot &amp;ldquo;plasma&amp;rdquo; of deuterium and tritium by means of powerful magnetic fields in a machine with a doughnut or &amp;ldquo;torus&amp;rdquo; shape. The other is to compress and heat peppercorn-sized pellets of deuterium and tritium, one after another, by hitting them from all sides with mega-lasers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both fusion methods have scored significant successes of late, which is the reason for the current excitement. In December 2021, at Culham near Oxford, the Joint European Torus (JET) maintained the necessary fusion temperature for 5 seconds. Crucially, 59 million joules of energy more than was put in came out &amp;ndash; enough to boil about 60 kettles. A year later, the US National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California got out 1.1 million joules more than it put in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are undoubtedly milestones on the way to a commercial fusion reactor, but there is a long journey ahead to scale up the technology. JET&amp;rsquo;s successor, the impressively huge International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, funded by 35 countries, is currently under construction in Southern France. But it will be only a test reactor, not a commercial reactor. And if laser-based, or &amp;ldquo;inertial&amp;rdquo;, fusion is ever to be viable, it will need to be able to induce fusion in not just one pellet but several pellets every second.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, it is immensely hard to make a pellet that is perfectly spherical enough that it implodes sufficiently uniformly to create the necessary fusion temperatures. The cost per pellet will also need to come down from its current level of a few hundred thousand dollars to a few tens of cents. The challenges are substantial, but so is the promised reward: unlimited energy from seawater, one of the most abundant resources on the planet, with no greenhouse gases generated, at least not directly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to be clear when it comes to green credentials. It is not quite true that nuclear fusion has no radioactive waste problems. Neutrons escaping from the fusion reactions cannot be confined by magnetic fields, on account of being electrically neutral, and will inevitably make the material of any containment vessel radioactive. Fusion proponents, however, say the radioactivity will not be as long-lived and problematic as from fission reactors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If all goes to plan, a new era of clean and plentiful energy will dawn in the 2050s, with the construction of the first commercial fusion reactors. Unless, of course, some unexpected hitch occurs, flipping that horizon back to its perennial 50-year state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Surrender by Bono</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6131/book-review-surrender-by-bono#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Our reviewer hopes for a second volume" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bono.jpg" height="748" alt="The cover art for 'Surrender' includes a black and white, close-up photo of Bono as a younger man" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story&lt;/strong&gt; (Hutchinson Heinemann) by Bono&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll memoirs are the telling of a miracle. If a musician has succeeded to the point that anybody believes their memoir worth publishing, they have triumphed over the colossal odds that stand against any bunch of earnest, spotty youths, feeling their way around instruments they can barely play, ever amounting to anything much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story related by U2 frontman Bono in &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, as its author understands, is remarkable even by that measure. The chances of Dublin teenagers gathering to make a racket in a suburban kitchen in 1976 becoming, within a decade or so, the biggest rock band in the world were virtually nil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is a series of recollections and digressions attached to 40 songs from U2&amp;rsquo;s catalogue. Though the book is more or less chronological, each chapter feels self-contained: a sketch, a parable, a confession and/or a funny story. Over the course of a long and extraordinary career, Bono has amassed a wealth of anecdotage. He relates his material with the instinctive skill of a born yarn-spinner, and an air of self-deprecating befuddlement that any of this somehow happened. There were, of course, any number of reasons why it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it did. So, Mikhail Gorbachev pitches up on his Dublin doorstep clutching an enormous teddy bear. George W. Bush gives him something of a wigging in the Oval Office. He gets repeatedly out-drunk by Frank Sinatra. He relates his encounters with the elites of entertainment, politics, tech, media and finance with deftly turned character portraits. Rupert Murdoch is &amp;ldquo;a sophisticated thinker, camouflaged by colloquialisms; Australian&amp;rdquo;, Nelson Mandela is &amp;ldquo;a wellspring of joy that defied the weight he carried&amp;rdquo;, Johnny Cash &amp;ldquo;the heavyweight champion of every room he entered except the one that contained June Carter&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is an echo in the latter aper&amp;ccedil;u of another key theme of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;. It is a book about women, although not in the way that memoirs by male rock stars often are. Specifically, it is to a large extent a book about two women. One is Iris Hewson, Bono&amp;rsquo;s mother, who died suddenly when Bono was 14: a recurring motif of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, as it is of U2&amp;rsquo;s catalogue, is Bono grappling with the uncomfortable thought that this tragedy might somehow have catalysed his success. The other is Ali Hewson, Bono&amp;rsquo;s wife: the pair met at school, and married in their early 20s. Bono still sounds like a man touchingly terrified of what might have become of him otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is not merely a great memoir by the usually lackadaisical standards of rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll autobiography. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book about music and politics, family and friendship, pride and ambition, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t wear thin even at nearly 600 pages. Indeed, there are sufficient omissions &amp;ndash; and certainly enough U2 songs &amp;ndash; to warrant a second volume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As someone present at both extraordinary occasions, I was surprised to find little reference to U2&amp;rsquo;s show at Ko&amp;scaron;evo Stadium in Sarajevo in 1997, 18 months after the lifting of the siege of the city, or their three-night stand at Madison Square Garden in New York in 2001, six weeks after 9/11 &amp;ndash; events at which U2&amp;rsquo;s rare gift for channelling a moment triumphed in difficult, volatile circumstances which most bands of their stature might have preferred not to confront.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting stretches of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; are those that reflect on the conundrums and contradictions which arise when one attempts to apply the idealism of rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll to the realities of politics. In both realms, Bono talks about the search for the &amp;ldquo;top-line melody&amp;rdquo;, the irresistible riff that lodges an idea, a sentiment, a mood in people&amp;rsquo;s heads, and sends them away humming it whether they really want to or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To a degree confounding its title, &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; serves as a brisk primer in the art of getting stuff actually done. It turns out to necessitate much the same boneheaded determination and unwillingness to shut up that drive a teenager aboard the boat-train from Dublin to London to spend days schlepping from indifferent promoter to baffled journalist with a demo tape. Though U2&amp;rsquo;s songs have not been short on utopian sloganeering, especially early on, their singer evolved into a pragmatic and effective advocate, and &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is also the story of a political education, as instructed by many of the most influential figures of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did once ask Bono if he entertained any ambitions of political office himself, and suggested that Ireland&amp;rsquo;s largely ceremonial presidency might be suitable; he replied that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to move to a smaller house. Like many of his insights into the absurdity and opportunity of an unlikely life as a mega-celebrity, it&amp;rsquo;s funny because it&amp;rsquo;s true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here for access to the full magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Martin Wolf on the crisis of democratic capitalism</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6130/martin-wolf-on-the-crisis-of-democratic-capitalism#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Martin-Wolf-author-image-sq.jpeg" height="1368" alt="Martin Wolf" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin Wolf is chief economics commentator at the "Financial Times". He was awarded the CBE in 2000 &amp;ldquo;for services to financial journalism&amp;rdquo; and in 2019 won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Gerald Loeb Awards. His latest book is &amp;ldquo;The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism&amp;rdquo; (Allen Lane). Here, he speaks to J. P. O&amp;rsquo; Malley about democratic capitalism and the greatest threats to peace and prosperity in the west.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You define democratic capitalism &amp;ldquo;as the combination of liberal democracy with market capitalism.&amp;rdquo; You believe they have to work together. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you have to look at this historically. In complex organised societies, the dominant form of wealth was land. Those who controlled the land usually also controlled the armies, which meant they controlled power, and the people, the majority of whom worked for them. Over the last two centuries, a market economy became the dominant form for creating wealth. In this economic system, which replaced feudalism, a new capitalist elite was born in which everybody had a right to try to become a capitalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that sense, it was egalitarian. Obviously, though, most people didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;make it&amp;rdquo;. But we eventually ended up with universal suffrage and democracy &amp;hellip; Crucially, capitalism created the social and economic conditions that [helped produce] a society in which people have equal value and equal merit. I believe democracy prevents capitalism from becoming a predatory plutocracy. Just as a market economy prevents a state from becoming an autocracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t international trade and capital flows (the movement of money for investment and trade) pose a serious challenge to this system?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the core tensions in democratic capitalism is that democracy is bound up with a territorial jurisdiction. Namely: you are a citizen of one country to which you are most attached, and to which you pay your taxes. But from its beginning, capitalism has had a transnational aspect. Because market opportunities exist across the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The level of prosperity that most of us now expect demands a very high level of international trade. Moreover, an essential part of international commerce is foreign investment, which allows capital to spread out across the world. A combination of trade and foreign investment has accelerated big social and economic changes in western societies, particularly with regards to deindustrialisation. This has seen the labour force in industry shrinking everywhere, though this is mainly because we can produce more and more goods with fewer and fewer people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the biggest source of instability to the global economy in recent years has been capital flows. Particularly in the uncontrolled financial sector, which was really what was behind the global financial crisis, which had a devastating long-term impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I believe we can still sustain a liberal democratic capitalist system, while having open economies. In fact, there&amp;rsquo;s no real alternative for us. An open international economy is going to be beneficial for most of humanity. It gives tremendous opportunities for development. And we&amp;rsquo;ve got to try and do better to manage the consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your latest book, &amp;ldquo;The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism&amp;rdquo;, proposes ways to beat tax dodging by multinational corporations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tax reform is one of the big issues. We need to have land [value] taxes [taxing the rental value of land]. They&amp;rsquo;re very easy to impose actually. A lot of the value created by the corporate sector, and by investment more broadly, ends up in land values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With regards to corporation tax, my view is that there is a legitimate case for allowing investment spending to be deducted from the tax base, because you want corporations to invest. But the rate of tax on profits which are uninvested should align with the top income tax. When you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with internationally mobile factors of production, which are very difficult to tax easily in an open mobile economy, where capital moves quickly, then the obvious thing to do is to reach international agreements. This will lead to further efforts to eliminate tax havens. But, more importantly, to agree on a common basis for tax, which could help raise substantially more revenue from corporations and their owners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also address the challenges faced by the World Trade Organization since it was founded in 1995. Why has cooperation not worked out as planned?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, the WTO was built around the idea that it would be possible to create a set of rules that governed all of world trade. That became more difficult, however, as the world started to divide into blocks, with the west on the one side, and China on the other. That makes it very difficult to run global trade rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of this became very politically sensitive because globalisation had not benefited everyone. That has led to a political backlash, particularly in the United States, where the welfare state is weak. The policy solution for the US has been to become more protectionist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What should have happened over the last fifteen years was a way for the west to bring the Chinese regime closer to our system. It was not impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it never happened. So we now have this rather unique problem, where we have this huge economic player &amp;ndash; China &amp;ndash; which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to fit into the underlying principles of liberal democratic capitalism, as we understand it. The Americans see this in geopolitical terms. And if you add those two things together, the WTO ceases to function, to cover all of global trade. The global order underpinning global capitalism from 1990 to 2007 has now gone. That is obvious. The question remains: how do we manage this process of reversal?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest threats to peace and prosperity in the west today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no doubt we are going through an enormously challenging period in global affairs. The war in Ukraine has created economic chaos. We also have the relationship between China and Russia and the adversarial relationship between China and the United States. It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to predict how it is all going to end up. The outcomes are potentially very dangerous. Namely: extreme global nuclear war. I&amp;rsquo;m not forecasting that. But it&amp;rsquo;s clearly a threat that is very real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the west needs to protect its political system and its economies. That means basic economic and military security. It also requires some reconsiderations of our trade relations with the rest of the world, particularly with China. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we should stop trade altogether with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, we have to be sure that a Chinese influence does not infringe on our own freedoms or interfere with our own institutions. Managing relationships with rival powers is also important. The west has failed with Russia. We cannot fail with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the climate crisis? How does the west&amp;rsquo;s relationship with China factor in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have an obligation to look after our shared planet. For the first time in history, human beings are reshaping the planet in very dramatic ways. Notably, the extreme damage that is being done to the climate system, the oceans and the biosphere. China is also part of that. We cannot solve these problems without China. It is, after all, the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. China is probably more responsible for overfishing than any other country too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But we have to compete and cooperate, while avoiding actually conflicting with China. Historically, relationships like this have often, but not always, ended up in war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relations between the United States and China are now really bad. Particularly from the American side, which has become quite paranoid. That is stupendously dangerous. And if we don&amp;rsquo;t manage that, all the rest of the arguments I present in my book will become irrelevant, because we won&amp;rsquo;t have a world that is worth living in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
