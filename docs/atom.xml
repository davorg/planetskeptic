<p class="lead">Steve Sviggum wrote a real purty apology, seemed sincere and contrite. He really did.</p>
<p>Then he got an interview with a sympathetic reporter and said <a href="https://alphanews.org/university-of-minnesota-regent-resists-calls-to-resign/">what he honestly thinks</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sviggum, who served in the Minnesota Legislature for 30 years, said he has dedicated his life to public service and will not be pressured to resign. He said he’s concerned identity politics is ruining the country.</p>
<p><q>If the far left doesn’t ruin it, identity politics will. The woke community, the liberal community, if I may be so bold as to say, has taken [my question] and jumped on it. They say it’s racist and sexist. That’s the community that says, ‘If you don’t think like me and you’re not part of the group, you don’t belong. You’re a bad guy, and we will destroy you,’</q> he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, his apology was a pretense.</p>

<p>Now, in October, a policeman noticed him parked near a pre-school, and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arizona-gop-candidate-arrested-allegedly-masturbating-truck_n_635007e2e4b03e8038da457f">approached him to see what was going on</a>.</p>

<p>He now faces a felony charge and has suspended his political campaign.</p>
<p>I guess he was thinking really hard about the children.</p>

<p>Do you know why they say “never forget”? It’s so you <em>don’t</em> do the same thing if you find yourself in similar circumstances.</p>

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Theodore Beale AKA Vox Day is in the news again. A few years ago, sick of all those comic book movies full of good guys and liberal ideals (I&amp;#8217;ve got news for him: most of them are violent libertarian fantasies), he decided to promote and raise money for his idea of a good comic book story: &lt;i&gt;Rebel&amp;#8217;s Run&lt;/i&gt;, a Confederacy-themed anti-woke superhero pissed off at a world that has made hate crimes a, well, &lt;em&gt;crime&lt;/em&gt;. How dare they? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, it was an idea from rabid Vox Day and his legion of frothing mad, walking talking hate crimes. &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/anti-woke-superhero-movie-rebels-run-blown-up-in-dollar1-million-con"&gt;There was a chance he could pull it off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was reason to think Beale and his fans could realize their dream of going from comic books to cinema, if only through sheer fanaticism. His devoted followers call him the “Supreme Dark Lord of the Evil Legion of Evil,” and describe themselves as his “minions.” Beale’s supporters, who frequently complain about supposed progressive “social justice warrior” influence creeping into fields like video games and science fiction, had already funded a handful of comic book issues and stirred up a controversy at science fiction’s premiere awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beale’s history of racism could have made it difficult for Rebel’s Run, which stars a character sometimes depicted in a Confederate flag bustier, to find traditional financing. He has claimed that certain races are more likely to commit violence and called one of his foes in the science-fiction dispute, a Black author, a “half-savage.” Beale has affiliated himself with the Gamergate movement, opposes women’s suffrage, and once described homosexuality as a “birth defect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even made a teaser trailer. They didn&amp;#8217;t actually have any movie footage &amp;#8212; it hadn&amp;#8217;t been made or cast or anything &amp;#8212; so basically it&amp;#8217;s a clip of a woman in a convertible firing a pistol at some stock footage of cops. It&amp;#8217;s not at all impressive but it got the conservative donors fired up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/345389018?h=51ce2df03d" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/345389018"&gt;Rebel&amp;#039;s Run Teaser Trailer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/user4162883"&gt;Galatia Films&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He raised a &lt;em&gt;million dollars&lt;/em&gt; from his minions, which is small potatoes in the big screen superhero world, but hey, it was seed money. He just needed to invest it somewhere safe, build on his now-demonstrated ability to raise funding, persuade some investors to grow it, and…uh, ooops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that track record, he instead turned to Utah-based Ohana Capital Financial, a business aimed at customers that would struggle to get money elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ohana’s promotional materials put it, according to prosecutors, the firm offered “banking [to] the unbankable.” On Nov. 5, 2020, Beale transferred the $1 million to Ohana to be held in escrow in advance of future film funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohana was the creation of James Wolfgramm, a self-described cryptocurrency billionaire who posted pictures of sports cars that supposedly belonged to him on social media. But in fact, according to a federal indictment filed last month, Wolfgramm’s wealth was a sham. The sports car pictures, for example, were pulled from other websites. Wolfgramm’s business also sold what were billed as high-tech cryptocurrency mining rigs — but those too were a hoax, according to prosecutors, with their screens just running on a loop to create the illusion of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to Beale and his supporters, the indictment alleges, Wolfgramm was deeply in debt to one of his business’s other clients. That client had paid Ohana more than $4 million in September 2020, several months into the Covid-19 pandemic, as part of what was meant to be a payment to a Chinese manufacturer of personal protective equipment. Instead of carrying out the transaction, prosecutors allege, Wolfgramm spent the millions on his own unrelated business issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. He trusted a &lt;em&gt;cryptocurrency grifter&lt;/em&gt; with his seed money. It&amp;#8217;s gone. All of it, vanished into the pockets of con artists and conservatives…but I repeat myself. The movie is not going to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#8217;t you worry about Vox Day. He&amp;#8217;s already blaming the libs. It was a conspiracy, don&amp;#8217;t you know, to destroy his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beale claims, without evidence, that the alleged con was carried out to disrupt his right-wing fanbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I strongly suspect that this whole thing was a targeted operation intended to break our community,&lt;/q&gt; Beale said in the video he published last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#8217;s bouncing back with another fantastic anti-woke plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beale isn’t done with movies yet, though. In a video to his fans, he told them he’s working on a script starring his friend, antisemitic former comedian &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Benjamin"&gt;Owen Benjamin&lt;/a&gt;. In this new movie, Beale plans to cast Benjamin—who believes the moon landing was faked—as the head of NASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere out there, another cryptobro is rubbing his hands in glee, anticipating another windfall of a million or more from the gullible minions of the Supreme Dark Lord of the Evil Legion of Evil.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pull of our ancient ancestors</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6030/the-pull-of-our-ancient-ancestors#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="The Nine Ladies stone circle, Stanton Moor " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Nine_Ladies_stone_circle,_Stanton_Moor_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2360408.jpg" height="631" alt="The Nine Ladies of Stanton Moor" width="946" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Stanton Moor is situated in Derbyshire&amp;rsquo;s beautiful Peak District National Park, in the heart of England. At first glance up here, it&amp;rsquo;s all foxgloves, purple heather and wildflowers. But if you have an archaeologist&amp;rsquo;s eye, like my friend Ian Jackson, you can detect something more deliberately patterned in the rocky formations that stretch out to the horizon in every direction: the outline of a Bronze Age roundhouse, sunken into the rock-strewn moor. The walls are long fallen and weathered away. Ian pointed out the narrow path that leads downwards and suddenly I saw it too. I stepped into the entrance and back through time. I was in someone&amp;rsquo;s home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re closer to the Bronze Age people than they were to those who built Stonehenge,&amp;rdquo; Ian observed. For a moment I was struck silent with the majesty of that timescale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;I had come Bronze Age hunting because, like many people it seems, I have recently become fascinated with the pre-Roman peoples of the British Isle. My walk was partly prompted by the British Museum&amp;rsquo;s blockbuster early summer exhibition on Stonehenge, the Neolithic stone circle in Wiltshire. Such stone circles pepper the length and breadth of this island nation. Not far from Stanton Moor is Arbor Low, another Neolithic stone circle at which the stones are now flat on the ground. Historians believe they were deliberately knocked down by medieval people, fuelled by their own superstitions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Stonehenge is a monument that Brits tend to think of as archetypically British. But the exhibition confounded all expectations. A wall mounted with dozens of beautiful stone axe heads from all over Europe revealed, post-Brexit, an almost provocatively counterintuitive picture; Britain connected by a large land bridge to northern Europe, with Stonehenge as the trading and pilgrimage heart of a borderless world. Recent excavations have provided plentiful evidence of trade from further afield &amp;ndash; pottery, jewellery and weapons from the Middle East, North Africa and Asia Minor. More intriguing still were the mysterious carvings of flowing spirals and cups and rings, on giant rocks and boulders found across Europe, from Germany to Scotland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The British Museum show was fascinating &amp;ndash; but there were some troubling aspects too. The exhibition included skeletons that had been unearthed in graves. One was the skeleton of a woman who was still clutching the outline of her dead baby, a bag of more than a hundred animal teeth buried with them as a spiritual offering. After more than a century of challenge, museums would not, I think, dare to display the human remains of ancient First Nation peoples this way. On the one hand, modern Europeans claim a kinship with these ancient brothers and sisters, and yet we tolerate what could be seen as the desecration of their graves. With their belief systems long lost, they have no one to advocate for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;And yet there is an honest spiritual craving in our modern behaviour around ancient monuments. Stonehenge is now understood to have been built in line with the natural cycle of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation around the Sun, aligning with sunrise during the solstices. Humanists surely recognise the pull of acknowledging our place in the beautiful but indifferent Solar System.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Iwitnessed this pull in action on that day before the summer solstice when Ian and I walked on Stanton Moor. Not far from where Ian pointed out the outline of ancient homes is a Bronze Age stone circle known as the Nine Ladies. Around it, a tent city had grown up, of young families as much as old hippies, wanting to be part of something bigger than themselves. Such gatherings have been happening all over the country at stone circles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Part of it, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, is that after all the Covid lockdowns, we are still cherishing our right to roam freely and be with others. But there seems to be something else we are craving. It may seem that we know very little about our ancient ancestors. We don&amp;rsquo;t have a good idea of how they looked, and even their bones have mostly vanished. But they have left the most tantalising glimpses: jewellery made of black obsidian; gold torques of such weight and braided beauty it&amp;rsquo;s dazzling to imagine them worn in ritual acts. It&amp;rsquo;s also pleasing to discover that some of the finds in the Stonehenge exhibition suggest women may well have held positions of power in these societies, as shamans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;These were humans living on a minute timescale compared to the weathered rocks of their monuments. Yet their mystery binds them to us. We are drawn to the idea of their transience &amp;ndash; for what did the pandemic do more to reveal than the fragility of our own lives?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Work Pray Code</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6029/book-review-work-pray-code#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Buddhist monks at Facebook&amp;rsquo;s headquarters" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/buddhafacebook.jpeg" height="1010" alt="Buddhist monks at Facebook" width="1596" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Pray Code (Princeton University Press) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;by Carolyn Chen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;What happens to us, and what happens to religion, when people worship work?&amp;rdquo; This is the question that occupies sociologist Carolyn Chen in &lt;em&gt;Work Pray Code&lt;/em&gt;, her new book based on in-depth research on Silicon Valley&amp;rsquo;s tech industry. Her answer reveals the book&amp;rsquo;s title (with its suggestion of bounded activities) to be a slight misnomer. For, as Chen discovers, work is not only &amp;ldquo;replacing religion&amp;rdquo; (increasingly omnipresent in employees&amp;rsquo; lives, and the object of faith and devotion); it is infused with spiritual and religious practices geared, ultimately, towards maximum productivity. This is a world where work is not so much distinct from prayer as blurred with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Chen suggests that Silicon Valley &amp;ndash; ostensibly one of America&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;least religious&amp;rdquo; places &amp;ndash; is not so &amp;ldquo;godless&amp;rdquo; after all. The tech workplace is &amp;ldquo;conscripting&amp;rdquo; religion; borrowing (typically, but not exclusively) from Asian spiritual and religious traditions, such as yoga and meditation, to help employees to become &amp;ldquo;whole&amp;rdquo; and connect to their &amp;ldquo;authentic selves&amp;rdquo;. But the nurturing care and cultivation of employees&amp;rsquo; spiritual lives are not altruistic. Rather, they rest upon the logic that the &amp;ldquo;self-alienated&amp;rdquo; worker operates at sub-optimal capacity. They are also vulnerable to burnout, which is blamed not on overwork, but &amp;ldquo;insufficient self-care&amp;rdquo;. No wonder, then, that employees might seek &amp;ldquo;optimisation&amp;rdquo; through practices including meditation, journaling and even fasting. Chen quotes one CEO who asks his staff to anonymously rate, weekly, aspects of their lives including spirituality. &amp;ldquo;Everyone knows&amp;rdquo;, he explains, &amp;ldquo;that if you&amp;rsquo;re not taking care of yourself, you&amp;rsquo;re not playing for the team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Chen describes the &amp;ldquo;meditation entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; including mindfulness teachers, HR executives and the coaches allocated to high-potential staff &amp;ndash; who share the challenge of selling &amp;ldquo;a religious product in a professedly secular workplace&amp;rdquo;. In doing so, they renounce a &amp;ldquo;sacred, separate, Asian, otherworldly, and ethical religious Buddhism&amp;rdquo;, and replace it with one that is &amp;ldquo;universalised, Whitened, scientised, profitable, and efficient&amp;rdquo;. Meditation thus becomes a snackable &amp;ldquo;skill&amp;rdquo; used to aid creativity, flow and focus (alongside empathy, with a view to enabling more &amp;ldquo;user friendly&amp;rdquo; design). Indeed, the practices Chen describes seem so far from actual Buddhism that one wonders whether they can be analysed in terms of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; at all. Chen explains: &amp;ldquo;tech meditators&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo;, but use &amp;ldquo;religious traditions &amp;ndash; their practices, rituals, and teachings &amp;ndash; as tools or technologies to optimise their work performance&amp;rdquo;, directed towards the &amp;ldquo;religion of work&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Though wonderfully rich in detail, &lt;em&gt;Work Pray Code&lt;/em&gt; is frustrated by its failure to provide, early on, a firm working definition of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo;. This is clarified in an appendix, where Chen suggests that religion &amp;ldquo;in a secular age&amp;rdquo; can be studied not only through &amp;ldquo;religious things&amp;rdquo;, but those things that are also &amp;ldquo;sacred&amp;rdquo; to us and command worship (e.g. work, worshipped through yoga). Still, it leads one to wonder where &amp;ldquo;spirituality&amp;rdquo; ends and &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and, indeed, cultishness &amp;ndash; begins. Some readers may find Chen&amp;rsquo;s conclusion conservative: though critical of the extent to which work is worshipped, Chen does not challenge work itself; likewise, she criticises &amp;ldquo;religions&amp;rdquo; for not confronting work worship, but leaves religion per se untouched. She suggests, &amp;ldquo;Religious traditions can offer a powerful and distinct set of ethics, communities, and rituals to counter the morally bereft religion of work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Still, Chen&amp;rsquo;s critique of Silicon Valley&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Techtopia&amp;rdquo; and its impact on the wider social fabric is powerful. She describes how participatory democracy &amp;ndash; indeed, the common good &amp;ndash; suffers when we worship work and disengage from civic life; how public goods become private &amp;ldquo;perks&amp;rdquo; when the tech industry dominates; how so-called &amp;ldquo;wholeness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the basic stuff of a good life&amp;rdquo; has become the &amp;ldquo;privilege&amp;rdquo; of the highly skilled, while others lack even basic security. Silicon Valley is, she suggests, a bellwether. One need not agree with Chen&amp;rsquo;s framework of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; to see that we must pay attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Time for a new renaissance?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6034/time-for-a-new-renaissance#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;img title="HowTheLightGetsIn festival aims to bring disciplines together, particularly philosophers and scientists" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/highres_84_6896-1-_1_.jpg" height="1278" alt="HowTheLightGetsIn London" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;You know the feeling. You pass the window of a book store, or switch on a political talk show, and are overwhelmed by an irritating sensation of deja vu. Haven&amp;rsquo;t you heard these ideas before? Behind the shiny new designs, aren&amp;rsquo;t these latest non-fiction hardbacks peddling the same basic theories, tweaked to entice a fresh audience? It can be difficult to gauge how our own personal frustration relates to the broader reality. On Sunday, HowTheLightGetsIn London confronted this perception head on. HTLGI is a festival dedicated to "big ideas", bringing together academics, scientists, creatives and "thought leaders" of all stripes. They have more than a vested interest, therefore, in answering the question. Is our intellectual climate in Britain stagnating? If so, how do we encourage new and original thinking?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The event brought together speakers from the diverse fields of philosophy, theoretical physics and journalism to chew over the dilemma. While the term &amp;ldquo;Renaissance Man&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t pass the lips of any of the speakers (although they might have updated it to &amp;ldquo;Renaissance person&amp;rdquo;), the figure of the free-thinking polymath was a definite spectre in the room. John Ellis, the renowned theoretical particle physicist, called for a more meaningful exchange of ideas and collaboration between disciplines. He pointed out that the experimental techniques he uses to test his ideas within the field of fundamental physics could fruitfully be applied to climate science. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible, he said, to get small pots of money for this kind of work, securing funding for such projects in the longer term is disappointingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;"Interdisciplinarity" is a term that is readily bandied about these days, but as the philosopher Sophie Scott-Brown remarked, we "need to pay more attention to what it actually means." She said this could be anything from bringing academics from different departments together to &amp;ldquo;sit around the same table&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;melting down the barriers&amp;rdquo; between disciplines. She is strongly in favour of the latter, envisioning a transformative shift towards a more creative, &amp;ldquo;inquiry-led&amp;rdquo; approach. Taking up John Ellis&amp;rsquo; point, dynamic and complex problems like the climate crisis, or the future of global security, could be tackled with the inventiveness required through putting more emphasis on bringing people together on the basis of what knowledge and skills they might bring to the challenge, whatever their field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But this isn't only a question of transforming our approach to learning and research. The trend towards specialisation is tightly linked today with the pressure on universities to adopt business practices and become increasingly self-sufficient, in the light of severe government cuts. The incentive to meet targets, the pressure to secure funding, and the fierce competition for students all serve to create an environment in which, in Scott-Brown's words, ideas are pumped out as "products". Meanwhile, the kind of open-ended inquiry that so often produces new discoveries is hampered by the need to justify the research in advance. &amp;ldquo;Most of my colleagues have to be 99 per cent sure about what they&amp;rsquo;re writing before putting forward a funding application.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;It's interesting that the most concrete idea came from the non-academic on the panel. The journalist David Aaronovitch made an impassioned plea to &amp;ldquo;abolish the A-level&amp;rdquo;, arguing that this would change the culture of learning that runs from school into universities. He claimed that every single British government had done a report on the A-level and found it to be wanting, but that there was a stubborn belief that specialisation is what makes the English system exceptional. He advocated switching to the International Baccalaureate (IB). The United States has the largest number of IB programmes, in both private and state schools, and he suggested that we take some lessons from the American approach, where university degrees are also four years, instead of three, and place more emphasis on students studying a wider breadth of subjects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Aaronovitch disagreed that our society is suffering from a lack of new big ideas, however. Following the two "isms" of the 20th century (communism and fascism), we now have a distrust of them which is perfectly healthy, he argued. We can see this plainly from the much more recent example of Prime Minister Truss&amp;rsquo; mini-budget, which is deeply &amp;ldquo;ideological&amp;rdquo; and has been a "failure". With big questions like how do we get to net zero, he said, "I'm happy to be more pragmatic."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Whether in pursuit of bold new theories, or working on practical solutions, there is hope when it comes to bringing people together. John Ellis praised the inclusion of more women and people of colour in the research community, and the way in which technology was creating a more level playing field when it came to participating in scientific debate. &amp;ldquo;And here I am,&amp;rdquo; he joked, &amp;ldquo;in a philosophy debate, while two other debates are going on about my own field of science.&amp;rdquo; HowTheLightGetsIn is one of the spaces where philosophers and scientists in particular benefit from coming together. &amp;ldquo;This is us forming the new society,&amp;rdquo; Scott-Brown said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But the festival happens twice a year, a drop in the ocean. For the spirit of a New Renaissance to take hold, changes would be needed on many levels: cultural, political and economic. It's certain that we need creativity and invention in order to meet the confluence of crises facing Britain today. While our current Prime Minister may indeed have outlined a consistent ideological position, her ideas are explicitly rooted in Thatcherism. It seems likely that a failure to generate new big ideas appropriate to the particular challenges Britain faces today will only lead to a dangerous re-hashing of the old. We know that our intellectual climate is fed by many sources, but the health of the academy, along with our education system as a whole, is surely the bedrock of the edifice. Interdisciplinarity will be key to renewal, but any transformation will need to start by treating universities not as businesses within the higher education market, but as spaces of learning, sharing and discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More details on HowTheLightGetsIn, the world's largest ideas and music festival, can be found &lt;a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/london"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those of you who couldn't be with us in person, all the debates and talks from the festival will gradually be released online in the coming months on the Institute of Art and Ideas online platform, &lt;a href="https://iai.tv/?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;amp;utm_campaign=London2022&amp;amp;utm_id=Partner"&gt;IAI.TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Outrageous</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6028/book-review-outrageous#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/outrageous.jpeg" height="501" alt="Outrageous: The Story of Section 28 and Britain&amp;rsquo;s Battle for LGBT Education (Reaktion Books) by Paul Baker" width="323" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outrageous: The Story of Section 28 and Britain&amp;rsquo;s Battle for LGBT Education (Reaktion Books) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;y Paul Baker &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin &lt;/em&gt;was an infamous book for young children variously described as &amp;ldquo;terrifying&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ridiculous&amp;rdquo;. Originally published in Denmark in 1981, a small run of editions appeared in English translation two years later. It sought to present an affirming image of a child being raised by same-sex parents, featuring black and white photographs of Jenny (played by the author&amp;rsquo;s daughter) and her two dads happily going about their daily lives together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Produced with the best of intentions, &lt;em&gt;Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin&lt;/em&gt; disastrously failed to take account of cultural differences between England and Denmark, notably by including a picture of the family eating breakfast in bed where Eric and Martin are shirtless. Despite the fact that few had apparently seen, let alone read, a copy, the book and similar literature provoked a moral panic in this country, antagonising a range of ghoulish moral entrepreneurs and far-right journalists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;At the same time, Labour-led local authorities in some areas of London were attempting to introduce what would now be referred to as LGBT-inclusive education in schools, which brought them into fierce conflict with Margaret Thatcher&amp;rsquo;s government. In the shadow of the Aids crisis, the legislation which became known as Clause 28, and later Section 28, was passed into law in May 1988. Its supporters believed that they were protecting children from harm. Section 28 demanded that local authorities should not &amp;ldquo;intentionally promote homosexuality or promote the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.&amp;rdquo; It reached far beyond school classrooms, emboldening homophobic discrimination as well as fostering censorship and self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Paul Baker&amp;rsquo;s popular history, &lt;em&gt;Outrageous: The Story of Section 28 and Britain&amp;rsquo;s Battle for LGBT Education&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides a lucid and at times highly personal account of the rise and fall of Section 28, set against a backdrop of the turbulent moral and political conflicts of late 20th-century Britain. The book is at its best when narrating the popular resistance mobilised by the embattled LGBT community, ranging from mass public protests to pieces of audacious direct action. Oral history is used to relate two of the best known of these episodes, which &amp;ldquo;invaded&amp;rdquo; spaces at the heart of the establishment. In February 1988, members of &amp;ldquo;Lesbians against the Clause&amp;rdquo; evaded security and abseiled from the visitors&amp;rsquo; balcony in the House of Lords, disrupting the debate. The protestors (who in a nice touch, supplied the names of famous lesbians in history instead of their own) were arrested. The following month, another group of lesbian activists, frustrated at the way the media was covering stories about Clause 28, launched an incursion into a television studio, disrupting a live broadcast of the &lt;em&gt;Six O&amp;rsquo;Clock News&lt;/em&gt;. The ensuing scuffle generated the memorable headline &amp;ldquo;Beeb man sits on lesbian&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The latter part of the book covers the rocky road to the repeal of Section 28 in the early years of the 2000s; the fruit of sustained lobbying of LGBT advocacy organisations and activists. The delay in repeal &amp;ndash; six years from the election of Labour in 1997 &amp;ndash; demonstrates the difficulty in removing Section 28 in the face of resistant public opinion. There is brief coverage of the separate battle for repeal in Scotland in which a wealthy evangelical Christian businessman bankrolled a &amp;ldquo;referendum&amp;rdquo;. Accompanied by a spike in homophobic hate crime, it was claimed to show that a majority favoured keeping the legislation. However, mainstream politicians and the Electoral Reform Society cast doubt on the poll, and the associated &amp;ldquo;Keep the Clause&amp;rdquo; campaign was ultimately unsuccessful. This moment in Scottish history deserves its own in-depth account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;If there is a weakness to this book it is perhaps the failure to fully interrogate socially conservative ideology. Firstly, there might have been more consideration of the religious context of Section 28: the secularisation of English society since the 1960s, the declining power of Christian ideas about sexualities and the attempted counter-revolution by Christian moral conservatives in the 1980s. Notably, the pushback in this country failed to generate a religious revival similar to that witnessed in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Secondly, there is the murky issue of why vocal advocates of Section 28 in the 1980s seemed to genuinely believe that homosexuality was somehow to be equated with child abuse. Baker speculates that perhaps some of the members of the House of Lords who contributed to the debates had been &amp;ldquo;involved in coercive sexual experiences at boarding school which left them traumatised and confused&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but this theory only hints at one possible contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outrageous&lt;/em&gt; will not be the final word on the moral battles over sexual politics and regulation in late 20th-century Britain. It can be assumed that there was simply so much potential source material for this contemporary cultural history that plenty had to remain unsaid. What does make the cut is well chosen, and Baker&amp;rsquo;s writing style is capable of enlivening even the stodge of parliamentary debate. He has given us a witty, accessible and necessary book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6027/the-future-of-spycraft#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Interpreting a reconnaissance photo during the Cuban missile crisis, 1962" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/D990MF.jpg" height="773" alt="Interpreting a reconnaissance photo during the Cuban missile crisis" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In January 2022, US President Joe Biden declassified an extraordinary trove of intelligence to warn that Russia was about to invade Ukraine. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn&amp;rsquo;t believe him. Zelensky complained to reporters that the US was hyping the threat and hurting his economy. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the president of Ukraine, I&amp;rsquo;m based here and I think I know the details deeper than any other president,&amp;rdquo; he said. Within a month, 100,000 Russian troops attacked on three fronts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Zelensky has since become a heroic figure of courage and leadership. But he&amp;rsquo;s also human &amp;ndash; and his inability to see the invasion coming offers a powerful reminder of the challenges of intelligence analysis. Everyone knows, but we often forget, that predicting the future is hard. Experts loaded with data are often wrong. Doctors offer incorrect diagnoses and investors back the wrong companies. Intelligence is even harder, because data is scarce and adversaries are working hard to deceive. In foreign policy, the world out there is difficult to anticipate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s only part of the story. The other part &amp;ndash; which often gets overlooked &amp;ndash; is us: human brains are not wired to assess the future well. Psychology research finds that people rely on mental shortcuts to process the information bombarding them each day. These shortcuts are called cognitive biases. They enable faster thinking and efficient decision-making, like skimming Yelp reviews to pick a restaurant and voting on party-line tickets rather than carefully assessing each candidate for every local position. But cognitive biases are also prone to error, tricking our brains into thinking likely events are unlikely and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Certain biases have played an outsized role in intelligence, from China&amp;rsquo;s entry into the Korean War, and the Cuban missile crisis, to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq and Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s unwillingness to believe Russia would invade. Events seem like surprises, even when they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Optimism bias and probabilities&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The most likely explanation for Zelensky&amp;rsquo;s dismissal of US intelligence warnings was that he didn&amp;rsquo;t want them to be true. He suffered from optimism bias, or a tendency to view information through the lens of wishful thinking. He&amp;rsquo;s got plenty of company. Optimism bias is everywhere. Researchers have found that people believe good events will happen to themselves more than others, that their own investments will outperform the average, that their favourite sports team has a higher chance of winning than it actually does. Optimism distorts the assessment of information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Politicians can be highly susceptible to proposals claiming favourable estimates of success, whether it&amp;rsquo;s humanitarian intervention in Somalia, war in Libya or renewed sanctions against Iran. The leaders of nearly every country involved in the First World War predicted a swift victory. &amp;ldquo;Give me 700,000 men and I will conquer Europe,&amp;rdquo; said General No&amp;euml;l de Castelnau, chief of staff for the French army at the outbreak of the war. Castelnau got 8.4 million men &amp;ndash; more than ten times the number he said he needed &amp;ndash; but Europe wasn&amp;rsquo;t conquered. It was decimated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Humans are not objective, no matter how hard we try to be. Researchers have found that people are wedded to their initial beliefs and will cling to them even in the face of contrary evidence. In Roman times, the imperial physician Galen was so confident in his remedies that no evidence could prove him wrong. He wrote, &amp;ldquo;All who drink of this treatment recover in a short time, except those whom it does not help, who all die. It is obvious, therefore, that it fails only in incurable cases.&amp;rdquo; Francis Bacon warned of the dangers of confirmation bias in 1620, writing, &amp;ldquo;The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion . . . draws all things else to support and agree with it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;We are also terrible with probabilities. Ever wonder why people are more afraid of dying in a shark attack than a car crash, even though fatal car accidents are about 60,000 times more likely? It&amp;rsquo;s not because people are stupid. The problem is availability bias: people naturally assume something they can easily recall is more likely to occur. Vivid, horrifying events (like shark attacks in the news) are generally easier to remember than everyday occurrences (like car accidents) even though they&amp;rsquo;re statistically less likely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;And intelligence analysts are human, like everyone else. We can see the powerful grip of recent experience in how different intelligence analysts viewed information about whether &amp;ldquo;the Pacer&amp;rdquo; walking around a suspicious Pakistani compound in 2011 was Osama bin Laden. Estimates about whether they had found the al-Qaeda leader ranged from 40 to 95 per cent. Those who had lived through the intelligence failure of overestimating Saddam&amp;rsquo;s WMD programs were more sceptical of the intelligence and issued lower probability estimates that the Pacer was bin Laden, while those coming off recent counterterrorism successes issued more optimistic assessments. What you predict depends on what you&amp;rsquo;ve experienced. It was only after US Navy Seals raided the compound that the evidence was in: they had found bin Laden after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p5"&gt;Thinking like the enemy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Good intelligence analysis also involves understanding how others think. Here, too, psychology research reveals why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to get inside the minds of others. One of the most challenging problems is called the fundamental attribution error, which is the tendency to believe that others behave badly because of their personality, while we behave badly because of factors beyond our control. Or put more simply, people often jump to blaming others while letting themselves off the hook. Drivers think that someone cutting them off must be a jerk, rather than wondering if there&amp;rsquo;s an emergency requiring them to drive that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In foreign policy crises, one country often overestimates the hostile motives of another, or underestimates how threatening its own actions could appear, or both. In the First Gulf War and the Iraq War, both the US and Iraq largely misunderstood the other&amp;rsquo;s view. Iraq underestimated the United States&amp;rsquo; risk tolerance following the Cold War and 9/11, and the US failed to see that Saddam was much more concerned about the Iranian threat than the American one. In both 1990 and 2003, an incomplete picture of the other side&amp;rsquo;s intentions and motives led to costly conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Trying to think like your adversary can backfire too, thanks to a process called mirror-imaging, which is the tendency to estimate how someone else will behave by projecting what you would do in the same situation. Framing your assessment with &amp;ldquo;If I were Xi Jinping,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;If I were a Russian intelligence officer&amp;rdquo; is one the greatest pitfalls in intelligence analysis and foreign policy decision making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The Cuban missile crisis of 1962 saw one of the most dangerous instances of mutual mirror-imaging, leading the world to the nuclear brink. American analysts failed to weigh the costs and benefits of a nuclear missile deployment to Cuba through Soviet eyes. And the Soviets appeared to make the same mistake when estimating how the US would react to its secret gambit. Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called the Cuban missile crisis &amp;ldquo;the most dangerous moment in human history&amp;rdquo;. Why? Because each side believed the other thought like they did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Improving analysis to prevent nuclear catastrophe isn&amp;rsquo;t just a matter of history. Great power competition is back. Russia and China are trying to rewrite the international order along authoritarian lines. Their nuclear arsenals are expanding and modernising at alarming rates. And war is raging once again in the heart of Europe. Today, Nato is grappling with how it can help Ukraine defeat Russia without provoking World War III. The stakes are high, the policy challenges are complex, and intelligence analysis is pivotal to success. What have we learned about how humans think and how we can do better?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;After the Iraq WMD intelligence failure, the US Intelligence Community (IC) launched several initiatives to improve analysis. One was commissioning a study by academics from different fields to examine ideas in the social sciences and recommend ways for the IC to adopt them. I was one of the experts on the study, and I jumped at the chance. One of our recommendations was that the Intelligence Community needed to test its analytic methods in a rigorous way to see whether, how and why some approaches worked better than others. There are about 20,000 analysts in US intelligence agencies making thousands of estimates about geopolitical developments every year. And yet these agencies had never assessed which forecasts were right, which weren&amp;rsquo;t, and why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Inside the mind of a superforecaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Several intelligence officials ran with the idea of testing. They approached one of our panel members, Phil Tetlock, a leading scholar on expert judgment. Tetlock had recently finished a 20-year study examining how well experts forecasted the future. It was the first large-scale scientific experiment of judgment ever conducted. In it, Tetlock asked a group of nearly 300 experts to make thousands of predictions about economic and political issues of the day: nearly 82,000 predictions in all. His main finding was depressing. The average expert was about as accurate as a dart-throwing chimpanzee, and their predictions were about the same as random guessing. The chimpanzee discovery made headlines. Less noticed was Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s other finding: predicting the future wasn&amp;rsquo;t just lucky guessing. Some people did much, much better than average. He called them superforecasters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In 2011, the IC launched a forecasting tournament to explore what makes some people better forecasters than others. Over the next four years, five teams competed, answering questions every morning ranging from the price of oil at a given time to the prospects of conflict between China and Japan in the East China Sea. There were nearly 500 questions in all. The winner was the team with the best accuracy at predicting things that did not happen as well as things that did. Tetlock and his colleague Barbara Mellers put together a team of thousands of volunteers called the Good Judgment Project. The University of Michigan and MIT each fielded a team. The Intelligence Community did, too. The fifth team was a control group. &amp;ldquo;By varying the experimental conditions, we could gauge which factors improved foresight, by how much, over which time frames,&amp;rdquo; Tetlock later reflected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;By the end of the second year, the results were staggering: Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s volunteer team was winning by a lot. They outperformed other university-affiliated teams at Michigan and MIT by such large margins (30-70 per cent), the other schools were dropped from the competition. Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s team also beat professional intelligence analysts with access to classified data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The best of the best on Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s team, the superforecasters, weren&amp;rsquo;t geniuses with multiple PhDs. They were artists and scientists, students and retirees, &amp;ldquo;Wall Streeters and Main Streeters&amp;rdquo;, as Tetlock put it. Tetlock found that the secret to success wasn&amp;rsquo;t sky-high brilliance or a &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/em&gt;-like mastery of news and facts. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t what superforecasters knew. It was how they thought. Superforecasters are far more open-minded, curious, careful and self-critical than the average person. They believe that reality is complex, nothing is certain or inevitable, and that ideas should always be subjected to evidence, testing and updating. They have what Tetlock calls &amp;ldquo;Dragonfly eyes&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the ability to see a problem with the 30,000 lenses of a dragonfly&amp;rsquo;s eye. While high-functioning groups harness the wisdom of different perspectives that each member brings, superforecasters can harness the wisdom of different perspectives from within, all by themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Perhaps most encouraging, Tetlock and his colleagues have since found in their experiments that superforecasting skills can be learned through training, practice, measurement and feedback. One basic 60-minute tutorial improved accuracy by ten per cent through a tournament year. That may not seem like a lot, but imagine if you had a ten per cent better chance of getting a promotion at work than all the other candidates, or your financial adviser could guarantee a ten per cent better return on your investments. When it comes to forecasting important things, ten per cent can be larger than you think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The future of intelligence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Humans are also getting help from machines. Advances in artificial intelligence offer potentially game-changing capabilities to process volumes of data at radically new speeds and scales, identify patterns across data sooner and more easily, and empower human analysts in new ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In 2020-21, I served on an expert task force that examined future intelligence challenges and opportunities arising from emerging technologies. The task force&amp;rsquo;s research included dozens of interviews and deep-dive sessions with technology leaders and intelligence experts across the US government, private sector and academia. We found that artificial intelligence (AI) and its associated technologies (such as cloud computing, advanced sensors and big data analytics) could transform every core intelligence mission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;We also found that the greatest promise of AI comes from augmenting human analysts, not replacing them. By automating mundane tasks that absorb tremendous amounts of time, AI has the potential to free human analysts to concentrate on higher-level thinking that only humans can do well &amp;ndash; like assessing an adversary&amp;rsquo;s intentions, considering broader context, examining competing hypotheses and identifying what evidence may be missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Harnessing the power of AI to improve intelligence analysis won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. Even the most advanced AI algorithms have severe limitations, including the inability to explain how they reach results and the tendency to fail unexpectedly in the face of seemingly small changes &amp;ndash; like mistaking a picture of a sloth for a racing car when imperceptible changes are made to the image. AI also raises important ethical concerns. And adoption requires overcoming technical, bureaucratic and cultural hurdles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The future of intelligence analysis can be better than the past. Our greater knowledge of cognitive biases, combined with help from AI and training in superforecasting, offers tremendous promise. Notably, US intelligence agencies correctly anticipated Russia&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine and issued public warnings, declassifying and sharing intelligence in real time to an unprecedented degree. The US Intelligence Community stuck by its assessment, even when Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s president doubted it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Physicist Richard Feynman once said that analysis is how we try not to fool ourselves. He&amp;rsquo;s right. Estimating the future will always be a hazardous occupation, especially in intelligence. The world outside is hard to predict, and the world inside our own minds is prone to error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But failure is not inevitable. Trying not to fool ourselves is a worthy endeavour, and evidence suggests we are likely to get better at it over time. We must continue to learn more about the processes and practices that make some individuals and groups more accurate than others, and embrace new technologies that enhance insight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an edited extract from Amy Zegart&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Spies, Lies and Algorithms&amp;rdquo; (Princeton University Press).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible.

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
