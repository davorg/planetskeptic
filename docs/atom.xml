<p class="lead">My wife was working in the garden this morning, while I was vegetating in front of the computer. One of the things Mary does is listen and fire up <a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/">Merlin Bird ID</a> as she works — <a href="https://wapo.st/45A2qLJ">paying attention to bird song is supposed to be good for you</a>, you know. This is what she identified in our back yard this morning: Chipping Sparrow, Dark-eyed Junco, House Finch, Black-capped Chickadee, Common Grackle, Rock Pigeon, Grey Catbird, American Crow, American Robin, Northern Cardinal, White-breasted Nuthatch, Red-eyed Vireo, Willow Flycatcher, Alder Flycatcher, Blue Jay, Common Raven, Eastern Towhee, Black-and-White Warbler, Philadelphia Vireo, House Sparrow, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Great Crested Flycatcher, Great Horned Owl, European Starling, Eastern Phoebe, House Wren, American Goldfinch, Downy Woodpecker, Chimney Swift, Dickcissel, American Redstart, Ruby-throated Hummingbird, Mourning Dove, Yellow-rumped warbler, Cedar Waxwing, and Yellow-bellied Flycatcher.</p>
<p>I thought she made up “Dickcissel,” but apparently it’s a real bird living in the Midwest. I know we’ve got owls in the neighborhood, and also hawks, since this is clearly a great feeding ground.</p>
<p>This does explain why I’m getting up early every morning — the cacophony is tremendous around here.</p>

    <title>Another reason I won’t get Neuralink</title>

<p class="lead">I was wondering what Neuralink is good for — it must be for treating some serious medical condition, since it involves serious surgery. But no! <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/elon-musk-s-brain-implant-company-neuralink-announces-fda-approval-of-in-human-clinical-study/ar-AA1bJ0Aj">It’s just techdude fantasies</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Neuralink’s BCI will require patients to undergo invasive brain surgery. Its system centers around the Link, a small circular implant that processes and translates neural signals. The Link is connected to a series of thin, flexible threads inserted directly into the brain tissue where they detect neural signals.</p>
<p>Patients with Neuralink devices will learn to control it using the Neuralink app. Patients will then be able to control external mice and keyboards through a Bluetooth connection, according to the company’s website.</p></blockquote>
<p>An app. Bluetooth. Controlling computer mice.</p>
<p>It absolutely did not help that I am currently using a computer mouse, a cheap wired optical mouse, that has an intermittent fault. Every once in a while, but not often enough to motivate me to get a replacement, the LED cuts out and the buttons stop responding. The fix is to shake the cable or unplug and re-insert the USB cable. It’s a bit annoying, I really should just get a new mouse, they’re only about $7.</p>
<p>But now imagine that your Neuralink device has a less than perfect connection: scar tissue builds up, an electrode gets jostled out of position. Every once in a while, the app drops the Bluetooth connection. The artificial limb you’re controlling becomes unresponsive, or even worse, you miss a kill shot in <i>Call of Duty</i> (worse, because I’ve seen how gamers can explode in fury at the most trivial stuff). There’s no easy cable-jiggling you can do, you’re going in for <em>major brain surgery</em>.</p>
<p>Or more likely, you’ll make do as I am with my mouse…you let it slide, 99% function is good enough. The only thing is, your brain doesn’t like wires stuck in it — there will be a gradual accumulation of scar tissue and localized damage, the performance of the device will inevitably incrementally deteriorate, and Neuralink doesn’t have a good replacement strategy.</p>
<p>“Right to repair” acquires a new urgency when it’s a gadget imbedded in your brain. Musk doesn’t seem the type to allow outsourcing of his profitable toy, and is probably anticipating making lots of money from obsolescence.</p>

<p class="lead">Has anybody read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminal_Man"><i>The Terminal Man</i></a> by Michael Crichton? It’s about a man who gets a brain implant to correct his epilepsy, but then it starts triggering increasingly violent crimes. I strongly dislike everything Crichton ever wrote — he was a Luddite who doesn’t know what he’s talking about, while the press and the public fawn over his bad science — but for the first time, I feel like he might have been onto something.</p>
<p>Reportedly, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/science/elon-musks-neuralink-gets-us-fda-approval-human-clinical-study-brain-implants-2023-05-25/">Elon Musk has gotten FDA approval to stick chronic electrodes into people’s brains</a>. Why you’d want anything associated with that incompetent boob permanently wired into your brain is a mystery.</p>
<blockquote><p>The FDA acknowledged in a statement that the agency cleared Neuralink to use its brain implant and surgical robot for trials on patients but declined to provide more details.</p>
<p>Neuralink and Musk did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story has triggered my internal Michael Crichton and now I’m wondering what horror will result from this decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients will start murdering people ala <i>The Terminal Man</i> (or Musk’s self-driving software) as Neuralink misfires.</li>
<li>Neuralink will catch fire and burn down to the patient’s basicranium.</li>
<li>Neuralink will explode when it’s switched on, cratering the patient’s head.</li>
<li>Neuralink will attract Nazis who will fill the patient’s brain with bad ideas.</li>
<li>Neuralink will do nothing at all, but it will distract the patient from investing in better treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>My imagination fails. You’ll have to think of all the likely horrible consequences of getting a Neuralink implant.</p>

    <title>I hope you choke on your birthday cake, Henry</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/27/i-hope-you-choke-on-your-birthday-cake-henry/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/poison-birthday-cake.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/poison-birthday-cake-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-70227" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/poison-birthday-cake-150x150.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/poison-birthday-cake.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Today is an evil birthday, a reminder that &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/05/henry-kissinger-at-100-still-a-war-criminal/"&gt;the universe is not fair and just&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Kissinger is turning 100 this week, and his centennial is prompting assorted hosannas about perhaps the most influential American foreign policymaker of the 20th century. The Economist observed that “his ideas have been circling back into relevancy for the last quarter century.” The Times of London ran an appreciation: “Henry Kissinger at 100: What He Can Tell Us About the World.” Policy shops and think tanks have held conferences to mark this milestone. CBS News aired a mostly fawning interview veteran journalist Ted Koppel conducted with Kissinger that included merely a glancing reference to the ignoble and bloody episodes of his career. Kissinger is indeed a monumental figure who shaped much of the past 50 years. He brokered the US opening to China and pursued detente with the Soviet Union during his stints as President Richard Nixon’s national security adviser and secretary of state. Yet it is an insult to history that he is not equally known and regarded for his many acts of treachery—secret bombings, coup-plotting, supporting military juntas—that resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news, as usual, was sickening. Kissinger is generally treated as distinguished, honorable statesman, and his crimes are glossed over because, obviously, he&amp;#8217;s a very old man and he&amp;#8217;s celebrating a birthday. You don&amp;#8217;t want to ruin his birthday, do you? (Yes, I do.) So the Washington Post runs a piece written by Kissinger&amp;#8217;s son, David, that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/25/henry-kissinger-100th-birthday-appreciation/"&gt;tells us all about his secret for living so long&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; &lt;q&gt;a diet heavy on bratwurst and Wiener schnitzel, a career of relentlessly stressful decision-making, and a love of sports purely as a spectator, never a participant.&lt;/q&gt; He forgets never having a speck of empathy for others, and never ever facing the consequences of his decisions. He has seen some of those consequences, but they do not deter him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a refugee from Nazi Germany, he had lost 13 family members and countless friends to the Holocaust. He returned to his native Germany as an American soldier, participating in the liberation of the Ahlem concentration camp near Hannover. There, he witnessed the depths to which mankind can sink unconstrained by international structures of peace and justice. Next month, we will return to Fürth, where he will lay a wreath at the grave of his grandfather, who did not escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s so sad. If only the lesson he&amp;#8217;d learned from his personal experience that murdering civilians is an evil act. At least the Intercept has a lengthy &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/05/23/henry-kissinger-cambodia-bombing-survivors/"&gt;article on the civilian experience in Cambodia and Kissinger&amp;#8217;s war crimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Nixon and Kissinger, Cambodia was a sideshow: a tiny war waged in the shadow of the larger conflict in Vietnam and entirely subsumed to U.S. objectives there. To Cambodians on the front lines of the conflict — farming folk living hardscrabble lives — the war was a shock and a horror. At first, people were awed by the aircraft that began flying above their thatched-roof homes. They called Huey Cobra attack helicopters “lobster legs” for their skids, which resembled crustacean limbs, while small bubble-like Loaches became “coconut shells” in local parlance. But Cambodians quickly learned to fear the aircraft’s machine guns and rockets, the bombs of F-4 Phantoms, and the ground-shaking strikes of B-52s. Decades later, survivors still had little understanding of why they were attacked and why so many loved ones were maimed or killed. They had no idea that their suffering was due in large part to a man named Henry Kissinger and his failed schemes to achieve his boss’s promised “honorable end to the war in Vietnam” by expanding, escalating, and prolonging that conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kissinger doesn&amp;#8217;t understand the meaning of &amp;#8220;honor.&amp;#8221; He&amp;#8217;s a butcher who promoted the impersonal use of technology to lay waste to villages &amp;#8212; he established an American tradition continued to this day, using drone strikes to wage bloody war with no clear idea &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; flattening farms and blowing up children will end a war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/05/henry-kissinger-at-100-still-a-war-criminal/"&gt;Mother Jones summarizes Kissinger&amp;#8217;s place in history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to cast Kissinger as a master geostrategist, an expert player in the game of nations. But do the math. Hundreds of thousands of dead in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and East Timor, perhaps a million in total. Tens of thousands dead in Argentina’s Dirty War. Thousands killed and tens of thousands tortured by the Chilean military dictatorship, and a democracy destroyed. His hands are drenched in blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet he will be feted today, and every simpering politician who praises this man is an accomplice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish there were a grave that they could lay a wreath on, and that the rest of us could piss on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Laughing at old ladies</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6123/laughing-at-old-ladies#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'An Old Woman', or 'The Ugly Duchess', by Quinten Massys. Copyright: The National Gallery" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Ugly-Duchess-cropped-resized.jpg" height="1008" alt="'An Old Woman' - commonly known as 'The Ugly Duchess' - by Quinten Massys. The portrait depicts an old woman with exaggerated features, including a bulging forehead and bosom squeezed into an ill-fitting corset" width="750"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is said that the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis died while laughing at his completed likeness of an ugly old woman. The Flemish artist Quinten Massys survived the painting of &amp;ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&amp;rdquo; (about 1513), but it might have been a close shave. Certainly plenty of people have at least smirked at her in the years since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is because, and there is no getting around it, she appears ridiculous: bulging forehead, protruding ears, puckered mouth, hairy mole on her cheek, huge horned headdress and shrivelled bosom. She looks beseechingly upwards, clutching a tiny withered rosebud. When the painting was put up for auction in 1920, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; advertised the sale of a &amp;ldquo;portrait which is generally accepted as being the ugliest one in the world&amp;rdquo;. But why is she ugly? And how are we meant to respond?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new exhibition at the National Gallery in London called &amp;ldquo;The Ugly Duchess: Beauty and Satire in the Renaissance&amp;rdquo; successfully answers these questions. It traces the influences on and atmosphere around the conception of &amp;ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; religious, artistic, misogynistic &amp;ndash; and convincingly places her within a long tradition of negative portrayals of women. There are witches, crones and hags; the incredible grotesques of Leonardo da Vinci; and the creepy John Tenniel illustrations for the 1865 edition of Lewis Carroll&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. All either influences on, or influenced by, Massys&amp;rsquo; duchess. It is to the considerable credit of this exhibition that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t dampened the fun of these artworks, while brilliantly elucidating the sinister threads that run through them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing that we discover is that the duchess has a partner. A man. Apparently, they were conceived as a pair, then separated and lost to each other for many years. Reunited, they make an odd couple. For one thing he looks remarkably unremarkable, even dull. He is seen in profile wearing a dark velvet cap and dark fur-trimmed coat. He looks prosperous and respectable. He has full lips, heavy lids and a bland expression, with one hand held up towards the duchess. Plainly, an exchange is taking place: his outstretched hand is a response to her proffered rosebud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exhibition makes clear that this was a familiar trope. The accompanying catalogue informs us that &amp;ldquo;The advent of print culture in the second half of the fifteenth century expanded the repertoire of secular imagery and propelled humorous subjects deriding what were then considered society&amp;rsquo;s ills.&amp;rdquo; One such target of satire was the so-called &amp;ldquo;ill-matched couple&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; usually a wrinkled woman or wizened man who is courted by a much younger partner desirous of their wealth. A brilliant example of this genre is provided in the form of an engraving by Israhel van Meckenem called &amp;ldquo;The Unequal Couple&amp;rdquo; (about 1480&amp;ndash;90). A corpse-like woman looks deep into the eyes of a beautiful young man with flowing locks, while his hand travels over the large bag of coins she is clutching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="&amp;quot;Alice and the Duchess&amp;quot; (1865) by John Tenniel. Copyright: V&amp;amp;A" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/FF8747.jpg" height="771" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our couple exhibit more dignified behaviour, yet they too would have been immediately identified as ridiculous. The man (possibly based on the vastly wealthy Cosimo de&amp;rsquo; Medici) is cast as a recognisably smug banker-merchant type, while the woman (rumoured to have been based on the famously ugly Margaret, Countess of Tyrol) is cast as a recognisably freakish grotesque &amp;ndash; a stock character borrowed from Leonardo da Vinci&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;visi mostruosi&lt;/em&gt; (monstrous faces). Her likeness appears again and again in different works by different artists &amp;ndash; in Florentine engravings, English misericords and French illustrations. In each she is a figure of either fear or fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One cause for ridicule is her outfit. The outsized headdress and revealing corset, in what was then an outdated and vulgar style, would have immediately marked her out as the &amp;ldquo;embodiment of foolish vanity&amp;rdquo;. The great philosopher Desiderius Erasmus (Massys&amp;rsquo; contemporary and patron) had especial contempt for such overdressed women: &amp;ldquo;Who would put up now with a decent married woman wearing those huge horns and pyramids and cones sticking out from the top of the head and having her brows and temples plucked so that nearly half her head is bald?&amp;rdquo; On seeing such a figure &amp;ldquo;Everyone would laugh and boo.&amp;rdquo; Clearly, in the 16th century, such a get-up was familiar visual comedy: the delusional old woman, full of lust and avarice, mutton dressed as lamb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But amid all the laughing and booing there is also a palpable unease. This is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the exhibition. Old women, their representation made more visceral by the period&amp;rsquo;s furtherance of verisimilitude, are here often depicted as sagging, cackling hags. Due to religious and folkloric superstitions and misunderstandings over how the female body works, there had developed a pervasive fear of women &amp;ndash; in particular, fear of their sexuality. &lt;em&gt;Malleus Maleficarum&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;The Hammer of Witches&lt;/em&gt;, first published in 1486), a treatise written by German Catholic clergyman Heinrich Kramer, declared that &amp;ldquo;all witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which is in women insatiable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This concern can be seen in Massys&amp;rsquo; sly-looking, overdressed hags (those horned headdresses are a sure sign of devil worship), but it finds its battiest representation in the wonderful engraving &amp;ldquo;Morris Dance with the Sausage Woman&amp;rdquo; by the Italian Monogrammist SE. Here, we behold a woman much like the duchess who holds in one hand a spear of phallic sausages and in the other a satanic cloven hoof, while a group of men dance around her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this image, and elsewhere, older women are depicted as worryingly powerful &amp;ndash; as enchantresses, seducers and subverters of men&amp;rsquo;s rightful position. The most exhilarating example featured in the exhibition is Albrecht D&amp;uuml;rer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat&amp;rdquo; (about 1500). An old, half-undressed woman with sagging breasts and an expression suggesting a full-throated war cry soars across the page on the back of a black, horned goat, scattering four cherubim in her wake. Her hair eerily flows in the opposite direction she is travelling and she suggestively grips the goat&amp;rsquo;s horn. In this disconcerting image of disorder and rebellion there is little for the male viewer to chuckle at.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In The Witch as Muse: Art, Gender and Power in Early Modern Europe&lt;/em&gt;, Linda Hults observes that &amp;ldquo;The sexual drive was believed to be greater in postmenopausal, widowed women. Their sexuality was especially repugnant not only because of their physical appearance but also because it could not lead to procreation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is interesting that Massys&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;ugliest&amp;rdquo; portrait should have an afterlife as the frightening duchess in &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; (beater of babies and owner of the Cheshire Cat). While not mentioned in the exhibition, the portrait also bears a resemblance to the witch in the Studio Ghibli film &lt;em&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/em&gt;. She becomes, in these new guises, divorced from the real-life fears and prejudices that shaped her in the first place. She is just a scary template. What is affecting about the items collected at the National Gallery is that they remind us of the uncomfortable themes beneath. In their laughter, sadness or fury, the paintings reflect something in the viewer. Perhaps a guilty conscience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exhibition holds out the promise of discovering a duchess who is not only grotesque, but also &amp;ldquo;subversive, fierce and defiant&amp;rdquo;. While the curators have gamely tried to reposition her as a more actively destabilising presence, this is ultimately unconvincing. Like it or not, the joke is entirely at her expense. &amp;ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&amp;rdquo; was conceived and executed amid titters, for an audience that was looking for a laugh. Although now, in this concise but wide-ranging exhibition, she might finally be in more sympathetic company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Travelling back in time with the Beatles</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6122/travelling-back-in-time-with-the-beatles#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/The_Beatles_performing_at_The_Ed_Sullivan_Show.jpg" height="641" alt="The Beatles performing on The Ed Sullivan Show" width="921"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my favourite scene from their animated film &lt;em&gt;Yellow Submarine&lt;/em&gt;, the cartoon Beatles see a submarine, identical to theirs, going in the opposite direction. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s someone in it. Look!&amp;rdquo; one remarks. &amp;ldquo;And they&amp;rsquo;re waving,&amp;rdquo; says another, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a group of fellas.&amp;rdquo; They wave back, realising that it&amp;rsquo;s themselves, going backwards in time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought often about how strange it must feel, being Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr, seeing their years as the Beatles &amp;ndash; one phase of their long lives &amp;ndash; take on a perpetual existence. And, quite unexpectedly, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself contributing to that spinning media whirl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In late March, I learned of the existence of an almost complete concert recording of the band made by a 15-year-old student at Stowe boarding school. A few days later, I broadcast the news on my BBC Radio programme Front Row. I had gone to Stowe with the former student, John Bloomfield, to make a special programme about the 60th anniversary of the concert. I had no idea about the tape until Bloomfield, now 75, revealed its existence to me. Listening to the concert transported me back to 4 April 1963, a particular moment in time when a group of privately educated boys saw the future in their encounter with a quartet of working-class boys from Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bloomfield had clearly decided now was the time to uncover the &amp;ldquo;lost tape&amp;rdquo;, and I was touched by his trust in me. I alerted Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn and arranged for us to listen to it in full together. Lewisohn told me the tape was genuinely important, for capturing the band in full, at a unique moment and before their gigs became entirely blanketed in screams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Certainly, when Bloomfield played some of the recorded songs from the original school theatre stage, through the modern speakers, I experienced something akin to a transformative moment: a realisation of how mind-blowing the juddering, bone-shaking intensity of their live performance must have been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As time transports us further away from the &amp;rsquo;60s and the Beatles, there is a sense of a growing reverence. Little snippets of film footage or old photographs emerge regularly like religious relics to be gawped at in the news and, as in medieval times, bought up by rich collectors for their private reliquaries. I had no intention of contributing to this trend. My story was really about the social history of that moment &amp;ndash; the unique collision of class and culture that took place during that concert, with its almost entirely male audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a massive mythology that has built up around such moments in the Beatles&amp;rsquo; career, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lovely secular power in the fact that the gig has been captured on tape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have the vision of a sixth-former to thank, who had seen the band perform in the Cavern nightclub and approached the manager. This bold student, Dave Moores (who would go on to become the chairman of Liverpool FC), organised the concert himself, selling tickets at 5 shillings to cover the &amp;pound;100 fee, without involving any schoolmasters. Bloomfield was stage manager and decided to run a tape with a microphone at the front of the stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no denying the intense religious devotion that the band evoke in some fans. Within hours of breaking the story I had messages from several countries, some polite, but most with an edge of urgency, desperately keen to know what was on the set list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One astute reader queried anxiously about whether a photograph of the band at Stowe that night, used to illustrate a newspaper story about my find, had been flipped or mirrored &amp;ndash; they were concerned that Paul and Ringo were holding pens in their wrong hands (Paul and Ringo are left-handed, although Ringo might have signed with his right).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New threads to the story have emerged since then, through the people contacting me. One of the very few girls at the gig, a daughter of the couple who ran the tuck shop, got in touch on hearing my report. I connected her to Bloomfield, a boy she&amp;rsquo;d not spoken to for 60 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Yellow Submarine&lt;/em&gt;, the old sea captain warns the band, &amp;ldquo;If we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we&amp;rsquo;ll all disappear up our own existence.&amp;rdquo; But there is nothing introspective about this story. I was delighted to hear that Bloomfield plans to donate the tape to a public cultural institution. Far from adding to a private reliquary, it looks like the Stowe tape will continue to open up joyful stories for the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The DUNE project will investigate the neutrino &amp;ndash; the tiniest of fundamental particles, meaning &amp;ldquo;the little neutral one&amp;rdquo; in Italian. It is being constructed one mile deep below Sanford Lab in South Dakota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neutrinos are so tiny that they barely interact with anything and simply glide straight through you, through the Earth and out the other side. But these particles have a mighty role to play in helping us understand some of the most fundamental questions in physics: What is the origin of matter and why is there an imbalance of matter and anti-matter? Is there a grand unifying theory that connects all forces? How do black holes form?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 scientists and engineers, from 200 labs and universities across 30 countries, are collaborating to build DUNE in the hope it will reveal key information about this mysterious particle. The DUNE experiment starts with an underground particle accelerator, where particles will smash into a target to generate an intense beam of neutrinos that will travel through the ground towards the detectors. That&amp;rsquo;s the easy part. The real challenge is in the design and construction of huge, highly complex detector systems that are capable of seeing a particle that doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each of four detector modules will be a liquid-argon chamber filled with 17,000 tons of argon. Neutrinos colliding with argon atoms will produce charged particles that in turn knock out electrons that will be detected by 150 2.3m x 6m units of tightly-wound copper beryllium wires, thus providing a signal that can be recorded as neutrino data. And now the DUNE collaboration has announced the exciting news that mass production for this first, colossal detector module has started, after a series of successful prototype tests at CERN.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

But inside the carapace, it is hollowed out. A rapidly diminishing number identify with it, share its metaphysical beliefs, subscribe to its positions on LGBTQI+ equality, or attend its services.

And this interest is set to increase, if the 2021 UK census is a benchmark. It showed that over the past decade, there has been a 12-fold increase in British people stating their religion as Shamanism...

    <title>Criminalisation of abortion endangers women and girls - including in the UK</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Image credit: Bret Kavanaugh/Unsplash" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bret-kavanaugh-MIfUp3FA5ek-unsplash.jpg" height="912" alt="An empty hospital bed" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reversal of Roe v Wade in the United States last year sent shockwaves throughout the world. As some states moved to criminalise abortion, there was outcry against the idea of pregnant women being treated as criminals for exerting agency over their own bodies. But, as a new report from researchers at the World Health Organization (WHO) makes clear, criminalisation of abortion is the norm, not the exception, globally. Of the 182 countries for which there was data as of October 2022, abortion was completely decriminalised in just one: Canada. Penalties range from fines to, in a handful of countries, life imprisonment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the UK there is a widespread belief that abortion is not a crime. In England, Scotland and Wales, the procedure is legal if authorised by two doctors before 24 weeks&amp;rsquo; gestation, or in cases where there are serious health risks to continuing the pregnancy. But it remains criminalised outside these parameters under legislation passed in 1861.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, at least two women were charged with abortion-related offences in England, both for allegedly taking abortion pills after the 24-week limit. One of the cases was dropped after prosecutors agreed it was not in the public interest to pursue it; the other woman pled guilty to unlawfully administering a poison or noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage, an offence under the 1861 law, and is awaiting sentencing. This year, already, at least two more people have been charged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dozens of women have also been investigated over the past decade, according to a recent report in the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;. Some were arrested in their hospital beds; at least one was jailed. A girl as young as 15 had her phone and laptop confiscated, for investigation, during her GCSE exams. Police produced text exchanges with her boyfriend, where she expressed doubt over having the baby, as evidence against her, before a coroner concluded that the pregnancy had ended due to natural causes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Northern Ireland maintained a near-total ban on abortions until 2020, when Westminster took advantage of the collapse of Stormont&amp;rsquo;s power-sharing deal to intervene. There are still 11 countries &amp;ndash; including Andorra and Malta &amp;ndash; where abortion is prohibited in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The great irony of these laws is that they don&amp;rsquo;t reduce abortions. A study in 2020 from researchers at the Guttmacher Institute and WHO found that the abortion rate was the same in countries where it was &amp;ldquo;broadly legal&amp;rdquo; as in those where it was completely banned. Meanwhile, even partial criminalisation can be dangerous, because it can discourage or delay women from seeking safe abortions and cause health workers to be overly cautious, even to the point of denying legal forms of care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evidence is clear: criminalisation only serves to limit safe and regulated abortions, while putting women and girls at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a preview from New Humanist's summer 2023 issue. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
