<p>On the one hand, that would be a nice sum for my retirement, and the odds of getting COVID from one exposure are low…and the odds of dying from the disease are even lower. On the other hand, gambling my health and life against what this guy considers chump change is a fool’s game.</p>
<p>The deciding factor for me is that Mr Kirsch is an obnoxious jerk who’d use my acceptance as propaganda to do greater harm to other people. His seatmate turned him down, as did several other people he offered $10,000 to. So yeah, I’d tell him no, and probably tell him to fuck off.</p>
<p>As it turns out, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/05/1036408/silicon-valley-millionaire-steve-kirsch-covid-vaccine-misinformation/">Steve Kirsch is a notable liar and quack with a lot of money</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kirsch is a serial entrepreneur who has spent decades pitching the next big thing, whether optical mice (Mouse Systems), document processing (FrameMaker), search engines (Infoseek), digital security (OneID), or e-commerce (Propel Software). His latest startup, M10, is a spin-off of a spin-off that sells a blockchain for banks. He has made millions from these projects, even if they have not turned him into a household name.</p>
<p>“You see this with people who have a lot of money, who think that reflects their intelligence,” Richman told me. “He considers himself an expert in something that he doesn’t have training or experience in, and he’s not following scientific methods to assess data.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Man, we sure have a lot of examples of that phenomenon.</p>
<p>His current obsession is with promoting crank COVID cures like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. He’s funding clinical trials, which is good, but then he tends to ignore or even contradict the results when they don’t go in the direction he wants, which is antithetical to doing good science.</p>
<p>His peers and the beneficiaries of his wealth are beginning to realize that.</p>
<blockquote><p>Peter Meinke, another former board member, spent nearly three decades in drug discovery at Merck.</p>
<p>“It’s really, really common for a small effect, something that looks exciting, to be a statistical fluke when you look at a larger population. It’s sad, but it’s true,” he told me. “With covid, 80% of your patient population does just peachy with no treatment at all, just a little bed rest and fluid. It’s actually much harder to parse out a signal than if you’re treating diabetes or cancer.”</p>
<p>In addition to the issues with fluvoxamine, advisors grew increasingly uncomfortable with Kirsch’s posts about ivermectin, which he has repeatedly claimed in blog posts and appearances in alternative media can be used together with fluvoxamine to prevent 100% of covid-19 deaths. (“The ivermectin data are trash,” Feinberg told me. “There’s nothing there.”)</p>
<p>Things took a final and dramatic turn once Kirsch started claiming the government was covering up vaccine deaths. </p></blockquote>
<p>An obnoxious crank with money. That’s all he is.</p>

<p class="lead">Over there on Reddit, there is a subreddit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/">r/evolution</a> for the discussion of evolutionary questions and issues. There is now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/11oai0v/proposed_rule_addition_evolutionary_psychology/">consideration of a rule to clarify their stance on evolutionary psychology</a>. It’s a good one.</p>
<blockquote><p>As you know, the moderator team has been considering the possibility of new rules to help improve things around here. And of course, we wanted to get the community’s feedback on the matter before we pulled the trigger. Please, just remember to voice your disagreements peacefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule #X: Evolutionary Psychology. The moderation team takes the stance that evolutionary psychology is pseudoscience. Like any pseudoscience, it starts with a conclusion rather than drawing that conclusion from data; it also tends to ignore or even demonize other fields of science that already provide information about the topics it addresses; and tends to boil personal behaviors and preferences (as well as complicated sociocultural and developmental phenomena) down to a handful of terms it uses as buzzwords to craft adaptationist/bioessentialist just-so stories that are often untested, untestable, or even wildly incorrect. It’s also frequently used to justify everything from preexisting biases all the way to dehumanizing rhetoric. These posts also tend to attract a lot of baseless speculation and experts on these topics are often drowned out by negativity and downvotes, all of which is antithetical to the climate we’re trying to cultivate.</li>
<li>Please note that while we discourage evolutionary psychology and pseudoscience in general, simply asking questions about the evolutionary basis for certain human behaviors or cognitive traits isn’t necessarily an issue: there are legitimate scientists in various fields (eg, anthropology, especially evolutionary anthropology, ethnography, behavioral genetics, etc), who study these topics with proper, physical data, and so there is information out there. However, if we feel that a question is better suited for other academics (eg, regular psychologists, historians, sociologists, philosophers, etc), if things start getting pseudoscientific, or if certain lines are crossed, we may choose to intervene.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More pithily, they say the “problem is that evolutionary psychology is science in the same way that Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food.” There is some polite agreement with the statement (I’m not saying anything, because I’d only provide loud impolite agreement) and some polite disagreement. The disagreeable all seem to be quoting Tooby &amp; Cosmides, which to me is just another sign that it’s a cult. EP has existed for decades, and all you’ve got to show for it is a pair of aging, founding authorities and a swarm of lunatics and bad publications? Cut your losses. Treat EP as crackpottery.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, the statement is fair and judicious.</p>

<p class="lead">Minnesota is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/politics/tim-walz-gender-affirming-care-order/index.html">doing the right thing</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order Wednesday directing state agencies to take action to protect and support access to gender-affirming health care across the state.</p>
<p>“All state agencies must, to the fullest extent of their lawful authority, pursue opportunities and coordinate with each other to protect people or entities providing, assisting, seeking or obtaining gender affirming health care services in Minnesota,” the order says.</p>
<p>Gender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender – the gender by which one wants to be known.</p>
<p>Walz’s order comes as Republican-led states around the country push restrictions on such care, with at least four states this year having passed measures to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors. As part of the order, the governor is prohibiting the state from cooperating with investigations by states that aim to penalize such care, saying their actions “pose a grave threat to the health” of members of the LGBTQ community.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Basically, Republican-led states have turned evil and want to actively harm their own citizens, but Minnesota will stand strong as a refuge. Join us!</p>

<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/Glinner-summons-the-mob.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/Glinner-summons-the-mob-500x270.png" alt="" width="500" height="270" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-69523" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/Glinner-summons-the-mob-500x270.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/Glinner-summons-the-mob-150x81.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/Glinner-summons-the-mob-300x162.png 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/Glinner-summons-the-mob.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a></p>
<p>He gets everything wrong again. I’m not practicing “mob-friendly pseudoscience” — the kind of stuff I do doesn’t find favor with pseudoscientists or mobs. Rather, Glinner leads a hate-mob himself, and if anyone is going to get mobbed today, it’s me, descended upon by the anti-trans loons endemic to the UK. So far, it hasn’t happened — maybe Linehan is losing his social potency? Or maybe the fact that the article is not great, and is published in a magazine for conservative twits?</p>
<p>He’s highlighting an exercise in pedantry published in some magazine called “The Critic”. I never heard of it before, so I looked it up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Critic_(modern_magazine)">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Critic is a monthly British political and cultural magazine. Contributors include David Starkey, Joshua Rozenberg, Peter Hitchens and Toby Young.</p>
<p>The magazine was founded in November 2019, with Michael Mosbacher, former editor of Standpoint, and Christopher Montgomery, a strategist with the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, as co-editors. It was funded by Jeremy Hosking, a Conservative party donor who had previously donated to Standpoint.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not familiar with many UK political figures, but I’ve heard of Peter Hitchens (vapid gasbag) and Toby Young (eugenics cheerleader and generally awful human being), so I’ve already got a sense of the flavor of the magazine. I think I don’t need to read further.</p>
<p>I did check out the <a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/The-tangled-web-of-sex/#">recommended “great piece”</a> though. It’s familiar stuff; it’s the same <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/03/01/spider-sex-is-more-complex-than-the-binary-paradigm/">Twitter nonsense I criticized before</a>. He has two points that he babbles about. One is that I’m breeding spiders, therefore I know deep-down that sex is real.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Recently, Myers has started breeding spiders, a project which he is documenting in great detail on twitter. What I found intriguing is that in his spider updates, any uncertainty about the reality of sex or how many sexes there are, seems to be forgotten. When he charted the growth of his arachnoid pets, he used two colours: yellow for spider-girls and blue for spider-boys with no need for intermediate hues. His blog is full of references to his female spiders producing eggs — never the males, whose function is to provide the sperm ideally without getting eaten by their mates. Quite how his spiders know about sex, given that it is (according to Myers) a social construct, is never explained. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is gender-critical bullshit. Recognizing that sex and gender are concepts that are interpreted and shaped by culture does not mean that I deny the reality of gametes, and reproduction, and egg-laying, and different roles by individuals in sex. You’d think they’d figure out that all my posts about breeding spiders must mean that I don’t deny that sex exists, but no, they think it’s some kind of big gotcha. Tell me that you don’t understand the role of culture in sexual behavior without telling me in so many words that you don’t understand the role of culture in sexual behavior.</p>
<p>Also, curious fact about my yellow and blue chart lines: those are assigned after the fact. We’re charting growth from the day of eclosion, when sex is indetectable, and we get our first hint about a month later when the later-identified females have a surge in growth (but it’s not a rigid distinction — there’s a lot of overlap), and about two weeks later they go through a molt and we see a distinct difference in palp size. Then I go into the spreadsheet and add the label for sex.</p>
<p>His second criticism, and the one he dedicates most of his article to, is the complaint that sex can’t be bimodal because we can’t quantify maleness and femaleness, that we can’t define the degree to which someone is male or female.</p>
<p>EXACTLY. That’s what I say.</p>
<p>To him, though, that means sex has to be a strict binary, unaffected by any cultural construction of the phenomenon, which is totally <em>bonkers</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Sex isn’t bimodal, because it’s a category, not a value. Specific measurements can have all sorts of distributions (including bimodal) — and if those traits are bimodal, they likely have that shape precisely because we have two, and only two, sexes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh. Sex is a <em>category</em>, and we have defined two, and only two <em>categories</em>, and therefore because we have constructed these categories, sex is binary and not at all constructed. Categories are absolute and magical, defined entirely outside the influence of human interpretation, and delineated by strict boundaries, defined by our cultural traditions in addition to variable biological properties.</p>
<p>OK, so if I add the categories “trans woman” and “trans man,” I have immanentized a new sexual reality, and can declare that sex is quaternary. Go ahead, add your own category, we can expand this indefinitely. All you have to do is come up with a definition that bounds your category. The boxes you find yourself in are entirely real.</p>
<p>By the way, I’ve operationally defined sex in spiders as trinary without even trying. I have these stacks of containers for spiders, and there are three distinct sets: males, females that produce fertilized eggs (they have specific labels), and morphological females that have been exposed to a male but refuse to mate and therefore don’t lay eggs (and lack labels). Those are the categories set up in my lab, therefore they must be real. It can’t possibly be that the non-reproductive females have criteria for mating that go deeper than whether the male has palps or not.</p>

    <title>Book review: Cocoon by Zhang Yueran</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6089/book-review-cocoon-by-zhang-yueran#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Capture.jpg" height="531" alt="The cover of Cocoon" width="343"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cocoon&lt;/strong&gt; (World Editions) by Zhang Yueran, translated by Jeremy Tiang&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zhang Yueran is one of China&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;post-80s&amp;rdquo; writers, also known as the Y generation. Born in 1982 in Jinan, Shandong, in the wake of the Cultural Revolution and the one-child policy, she grew up in the Reform era. This epic novel (which took Zhang seven years to complete) is a stunning evocation of China&amp;rsquo;s recent past and a poignant examination of how events reverberate through the decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former friends Li Jiaqi and Cheng Gong meet in their childhood home on the campus of Jinan&amp;rsquo;s medical university. Jiaqi&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, &amp;ldquo;the most famous heart surgeon in China&amp;rdquo;, is dying of lung cancer and she has returned to care for him in his final days. Zhang uses startling imagery in her opening pages to illustrate her protagonist&amp;rsquo;s alienation: &amp;ldquo;I stood by his bed, feeling death hover like a flock of bats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pair have not met for 18 years and attempt to lay to rest the ghosts that still haunt them. In the course of their conversation, they revisit the family secrets that helped destroy their own hopes and dreams. Their narratives are given equal weight in separate chapters, although Jiaqi&amp;rsquo;s is the more memorable. As they drink through the night and share their stories, old wounds are reopened and emotional scars retraced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zhang is interested in the psychological fallout of China&amp;rsquo;s Cultural Revolution on her generation. Both her characters are neglected by their fathers, who, Zhang suggests, are victims of the harsh times in which they grew up. Their parents&amp;rsquo; disillusionment initially unites the friends but, later, it rips them apart. Zhang writes perceptively about Jiaqi&amp;rsquo;s relationship with her father: her desire to be loved by him; his coldness towards her; her subsequent inability to form lasting attachments. The passages describing his indifference towards his young daughter are heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jiaqi and Gong are surrounded by the vestiges of state oppression, vividly conveyed by their childhood playground &amp;ndash; Dead Man&amp;rsquo;s Tower. Originally constructed as a water tower when the Germans inhabited Jinan, it became the gruesome home for the cadavers and spare organs used in the university&amp;rsquo;s dissection classes and experiments. It&amp;rsquo;s a sinister wasteland, the soil permeated with formaldehyde. Jiaqi swiftly recognises its importance: that &amp;ldquo;anyone who came here would be afraid to commit any crimes, especially capital ones... it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy to squander your life and not leave behind anything of value&amp;mdash;they could always come and gouge it out of your remains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The central act of violence that drives the narrative takes place in 1967. As hospital manager, Gong&amp;rsquo;s grandfather is denounced by rebels in a &amp;ldquo;struggle session&amp;rdquo;. He&amp;rsquo;s beaten up and left unconscious in the Dead Man&amp;rsquo;s Tower, a brutal attack from which he never fully recovers. Later, the family discover that someone had inserted &amp;ldquo;a two-inch iron nail in his cranial cavity that must have entered through his temple, leaving a scar so small no one had paid it any attention&amp;rdquo;. The nail had rusted, spreading infection through his brain tissue and leaving him in a vegetative state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the children&amp;rsquo;s desire to know who committed the crime that leads to their own fracture. As Jiaqi observes: &amp;ldquo;Secrets become secrets and get hidden away because they have the capacity for destruction... It&amp;rsquo;s hard to say what it was that suppressed our childhood creativity, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t create, only destroy. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because in this country, destruction is always seen as the highest form of creation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zhang believes &amp;ldquo;the point of literature is to bring us to a deeper level of existence, so we can experience something we never have before.&amp;rdquo; She manages to do just that in this remarkably astute novel, superbly translated by Jeremy Tiang. Her compelling narrative never lets up as she weaves together threads of memory which the reader has to unpick to reveal the truth. Cocoon is a powerful and stark account of intergenerational trauma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Meet the Indian widows fighting back</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Netradipa Patil has helped create a network of women who are fighting back against widowhood traditions" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/IMG_5358.jpg" height="1447" alt="Netradipa Patil smiles and looks into the camera, her arms folded, wearing a pink and gold sari" width="1448"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For years, community healthcare worker Netradipa Patil had been making her rounds in rural Shirol, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. She enquired into people&amp;rsquo;s health and asked how she could be of assistance. One day, she decided to ask an extra question: &amp;ldquo;How are you feeling today?&amp;rdquo; She noticed that several women didn&amp;rsquo;t even reply. Patil was haunted by their blank stares and silence. What made them feel so low? When she returned soon after, she encouraged these women to speak and spent hours listening to their stories. She discovered they were widows who had been harshly ostracised by their communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are more than 55 million widows living in India today. While dealing with the grief and financial loss often caused by losing their husbands, many of these women are pressured into conforming to traditions that have been described as &amp;ldquo;social death&amp;rdquo;. Excluded from festivals and celebrations, many are expected to stay in their homes for a year or longer after the death. These restrictions are accompanied by stigma. In some remote villages, widows are expelled from the community and sent to shelter homes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;None of these rituals make any sense,&amp;rdquo; says Patil. But in several parts of India, a woman&amp;rsquo;s identity is still tied to that of her husband. &amp;ldquo;This tradition goes back several centuries and the reason it&amp;rsquo;s followed even today is to curb women&amp;rsquo;s freedom and put restrictions on them.&amp;rdquo; If a widow fails to follow these rituals, she is shamed. People may even accuse her of never having loved her husband.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patil was familiar with these customs, but still she was shocked by the women&amp;rsquo;s stories. &amp;ldquo;It left me numb,&amp;rdquo; she says. One woman was a fellow healthcare worker, Lalita Mudshinge. She was in her early 30s when her husband, a tractor driver, died of a heart attack in 2017. Immediately, she was asked to break her bangles, remove the necklace and vermillion mark associated with married women, and refrain from wearing colourful clothes. Furthermore, she was forbidden from participating in weddings, child naming ceremonies and other celebrations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mudshinge was prepared for this ostracisation. She also anticipated being blamed for her husband&amp;rsquo;s death, as many widows are. &amp;ldquo;I kept all the medical records safely and even the autopsy report,&amp;rdquo; she says. But despite the evidence that he had died of cardiac arrest, she was still accused by her in-laws and members of the community of playing a part. They also wanted to force her to stay in the house for a year. This was not possible, as Mudshinge, like Patil, worked as a community healthcare worker, which meant regular trips into the centre of the village.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The men from the village would stalk me in the streets and make bad comments,&amp;rdquo; she said. The abuse reached a stage where even stepping out of her front door began to feel dangerous. &amp;ldquo;I was so stressed and scared that I often fell ill,&amp;rdquo; she says. The social stigma directly impacted her work, with senior staff yelling at her constantly. &amp;ldquo;Mudshinge was suicidal, depressed, and on the verge of leaving her job,&amp;rdquo; Patil says. However, within a few years, she was helping her fellow widows and battling patriarchal attitudes in her country. How did it happen?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The fight back begins&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It all started with that extra question, &amp;ldquo;How are you feeling today?&amp;rdquo; This simple invitation to speak progressed into hours of conversation, as Mudshinge was finally able to explain her plight. Patil gave Mudshinge her contact details and said to reach out at any time. She also started visiting the woman&amp;rsquo;s home and tried to persuade her in-laws to stop practising the widowhood rituals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially, they were not convinced. So, Patil increased the visits. After a few months, Mudshinge began noticing a change. Her in-laws were more accepting of her leaving the house, and even allowed her to wear jewellery and colourful clothes. Men from the community continued to harass her when she did her rounds as a healthcare worker, but after Patil began accompanying her, she found she was more able to face them down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patil was helping five other widows at the time. They were all coping with challenges, and she felt they were not being adequately supported. So she reached out to a fellow healthcare worker in a nearby village. Together, they began to organise awareness sessions for widows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These healthcare workers understand the plight of widows because they are all women and come from rural communities themselves. They are Accredited Social Health Activists, or ASHA workers. There are over a million ASHAs in India: roughly one for every 1,000 people. They are all female and come from the communities they serve. They do everything from prenatal care to administering vaccines, providing medicines for common ailments and maintaining health records for every community member. &lt;br&gt;Patil started to team up with more ASHA workers, reasoning that widowhood was a serious public health matter and should be treated as such. At first, nobody came to the awareness sessions. They had to squeeze in talking to the widows during routine community visits. Finally, after around six months of this work, with remote counselling done by phone, a few women started showing up to the sessions. &amp;ldquo;It was so powerful,&amp;rdquo; Mudshinge says. &amp;ldquo;It helped me muster the courage to face the stigma.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was still a long way to go, however, when it came to acceptance from the community. That&amp;rsquo;s when Patil came up with a unique idea. She invited all the widows from the nearby villages and asked a local government official to join them for a special event. Patil asked the official to celebrate the widows for their heroism in battling the oppressive widowhood rituals. The official agreed. It was a bold move. News spread in the villages and beyond, and the event was covered by the regional media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mudshinge printed the photos and kept them in her wallet. &amp;ldquo;From then on, whenever someone abused me, I showed them these photos, and it helped me,&amp;rdquo; she said. She would never have guessed that a photo could change her life. The event expanded into a series, hosted by several villages in Maharashtra. At each event, widows were celebrated and encouraged to break with the rituals and practices that had brought so much suffering into their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, social activist Pramod Zinjade started a movement asking village heads in Maharashtra to pass a resolution to ban the widowhood rituals outright. In May last year, Herwad became the first village to do so. The state government asked all villages to follow suit, and reportedly 7,500 villages have passed resolutions seeking to curb the practices. However, there are no legal ramifications if these resolutions are not followed through, so it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to say how effective they will be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Just the beginning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Changing local and state policy is important. But the work doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there. As lawyer and activist Amol Naik says, &amp;ldquo;Implementation is the key.&amp;rdquo; Naik has spent over a decade fighting to protect and uphold the rights of women farmers and agricultural labourers, many of whom suffer greatly if they are faced with widowhood. He points out that widows do have legal rights under Indian law &amp;ndash; such as the right to inherit their husband&amp;rsquo;s property &amp;ndash; but often feel unable to assert these rights. &amp;ldquo;Younger widows are ostracised and made to feel that their relatives are doing them a favour by letting them stay [in their own homes]. Eventually, they stop asking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Akkatai Teli is an activist who has spent four decades working with widows and bringing the perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence to justice. She says that many widows aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of their legal rights and there can often be a vested interest in not telling them. &amp;ldquo;Most of them are denied a share in the property and kicked out of the house because the in-laws fear they will ascertain their rights,&amp;rdquo; she says. Many of these women end up in shelter homes. The problem is so severe that in 2018, the government built a shelter home in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, that can accommodate 1,000 widows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patil, meanwhile, has continued to work on the root cause of widows&amp;rsquo; problems. Between 2017 and 2022 she trained a team of 20 women, most of whom are widows themselves, to help combat regressive customs. So far, the network has helped hundreds of widows from over 20 villages in Maharashtra. Her attempts are now being formalised into a full-time support system at the village, district and state levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patil&amp;rsquo;s goal is not just to help these women heal, but to ensure they can live a life of dignity. This involves practical support; ensuring the widows have the correct paperwork to access government welfare, training them to become self-reliant and helping them start their own businesses. She also helps them access mental health treatment. &amp;ldquo;Telling their stories can be triggering for the women,&amp;rdquo; she says, so they have learned to be careful in their work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there is another challenge. As an ASHA, Patil isn&amp;rsquo;t paid for her work with the widows, nor is she trained to provide counselling. &amp;ldquo;The health department doesn&amp;rsquo;t even acknowledge our work,&amp;rdquo; she says. The work with widows is classed as voluntary. She says that ASHAs aren&amp;rsquo;t paid enough in any case, and could achieve much more with adequate compensation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the exact figures vary across states, they are uniformly low. In Maharashtra, ASHAs earn an average of 3,500-5,000 Indian Rupees (&amp;pound;34-50) per month. They are paid per task &amp;ndash; for example, for providing antenatal or postnatal care and overseeing a pregnancy in a public hospital, they earn &amp;pound;4.90. &amp;ldquo;ASHAs are a support system for millions of people,&amp;rdquo; Patil points out. &amp;ldquo;If the government starts paying us adequately and on time, many [more] ASHAs can help women recover from their trauma.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A turning point&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ongoing support is important, as even if the lives of widows improve, they still have to recover from the abuse and ostracisation. When Anjali Pehelwan, 39, lost her husband to Covid, her relatives weren&amp;rsquo;t concerned about her grief. &amp;ldquo;All they wanted was to forcefully take away my jewellery and toe rings,&amp;rdquo; she remembers. Although Pehelwan resisted, a few women pulled off her jewellery, bruising and cutting her. The cuts healed in a week, she says, but it took a year before she recovered from the mental trauma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily, Pehelwan was able to access support. She was put in touch with Maya Patil, the ASHA worker who had helped Netradipa organise the very first awareness sessions for widows. (Netradipa and Maya share a last name but are not related.) Maya Patil started counselling Pehelwan on the phone and in person. Gradually, Pehelwan started wearing her jewellery again, began to leave the house, and started asking people to treat her as an equal to other women. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. &amp;ldquo;The community members were so aghast that they started calling me ill-omened and a witch,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in April 2022, Maya Patil came up with the idea of celebrating Gudi Padwa (Maharashtra&amp;rsquo;s new year), considered to be the most auspicious occasion in the Hindu calendar. &amp;ldquo;Traditionally, while a widow is allowed to celebrate this occasion, they are barred from performing any rituals,&amp;rdquo; Pehelwan explains. Maya Patil was determined to change this. She called a group of 20 women together, including Pehelwan and another widow. &amp;ldquo;I started talking about the discriminatory practices and why we should raise our voice,&amp;rdquo; she says. At first, the other women stepped away from the widows, but Patil wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give up. She convinced them to celebrate the new year festival together, with Pehelwan taking the lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a backlash from certain members of the community. People spread a rumour that Pehelwan was celebrating the festival because she had remarried. (Widows in India are allowed to remarry, but in reality they are often ostracised if they do.) A scandal was brewing, but fortunately the local journalists reported the event accurately, confirming that Pehelwan was still single. &amp;ldquo;That was the best time to shut down all such conspiracy theories,&amp;rdquo; she recalls, laughing at the memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, Pehelwan discovered that there were 450 widows and separated women in her village of Arjunwad alone. &amp;ldquo;We need to stop using the word &amp;lsquo;widow&amp;rsquo; and come up with better words,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Widow&amp;rsquo; is never a woman&amp;rsquo;s identity. It&amp;rsquo;s no fault of hers that her husband has died.&amp;rdquo; She found that many women wanted to oppose the rituals, but didn&amp;rsquo;t speak up because of the patriarchal system. &amp;ldquo;My goal is to help them voice their concerns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pehelwan works long hours as a data entry operator. But although her work is tiring, she spends her evenings taking phone calls from other widows, encouraging them to leave the house and assert their rights. &amp;ldquo;People think it&amp;rsquo;s a burden, but it&amp;rsquo;s not,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Whenever I see a woman healing, I feel I have given someone a new life. While this can never make up for my loss, I am proud to help bring an end to the trauma of other women.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The bikers' bible</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Robert Pirsig's 1974 bestseller continues to serve as a gospel for long-distance bikers" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/iswanto-arif-m1nHYuMvBAI-unsplash-small.jpg" height="1448" alt="A man on a motorbike in the mountains" width="1448"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, published in 1974, was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon. A work of fictionalised autobiography, the book follows its author Robert Pirsig on a long motorcycle ride through the US, from Minnesota across the prairie to Oregon, then down to southern California. The muscles of that skeletal journey are Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s philosophical musings on the notion of Quality. Pirsig created the concept in order explain the relationship between human values and societal values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At once both obvious and ephemeral, Quality escapes easy definition. (And brings to mind American supreme court justice Potter Stewart&amp;rsquo;s comments about pornography: &amp;ldquo;I know it when I see it.&amp;rdquo;) In his original formulation, Pirsig describes it, not a little paradoxically, as &amp;ldquo;a characteristic of thought and statement that is recognised by a non-thinking or intuitive process.&amp;rdquo; At another juncture, Quality is defined as the event which occurs between the observer and the observed. Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s search for clarity stretched his mind to the breaking point, ultimately landing him in a psychiatric facility where he was subjected to electroshock therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet, the concept has been influential. The book, a bestseller, continues to be read by motorcyclists, philosophers and everyone in between. This year, a long-awaited collection of writings has been published for the first time, giving us a deeper look at how Pirsig shaped his concept. Edited by Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s widow Wendy, an archivist and Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s frequent collaborator, On Quality uses outtakes from unpublished letters and lectures, and from Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s two books (Zen and 1991&amp;rsquo;s Lila). It is an intimate and highly selective look at his journey through the work of the early Greek philosophers, Asiatic mysticism and beyond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again and again, he approaches the concept from different angles, employing simile, analogy and deductive reasoning. Often, he only tightens the knot he has created. But there are moments of brilliance. In a letter written in 1995, Pirsig outlined where he saw Quality fitting among the pantheon of religious philosophy, placing it beside Hinduism&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Oneness&amp;rdquo; Buddhism&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Nothingness&amp;rdquo; and the monotheist&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; as a fourth path leading up &amp;ldquo;the mountain of understanding&amp;rdquo;. Optimistically, he singles out Quality as the one that cannot be dismissed by the &amp;ldquo;scientifically minded&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;meaningless, metaphysical claptrap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quality then, is a kind of religion, though one preaching improvement for its own sake, rather than in the service of some deity. It is less concerned with eternal life than with the pursuit of truth and beauty. Much of its appeal lies in Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s prose, which combines his repetitive, mantra-like style with a pragmatic, matter-of-fact charm. The book is illustrated with photos of his collection of tools &amp;ndash; spanners, drills, pliers and the like &amp;ndash; a reminder that this was a philosopher with dirt under his fingernails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The goal of truth&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I first read Pirsig in 2012, while preparing for my own long motorcycle journey, from the Canadian prairie to the Argentinian Pampa. It strikes me now as a voyage from one cattle country to another, though at that time it was too sinuous and ill-planned to be so clearly defined. I had none of Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s discipline, but like him, I struggled to find meaning in what I was pursuing. Was I travelling as catharsis? For freedom? For evasion? Adventure seemed the most likely reason, but I was too often alone and inconsolable to convince myself of that pursuit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Quality is the quasi-religion of what Pirsig called the &amp;ldquo;Church of Reason&amp;rdquo;, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is its holy book. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one to treat it as such. Motorcyclists I met on that trip, and have met since, talk about Zen as a kind of compendium for life. Like most adherents, there was among them more enthusiasm (which means, as Pirsig points out, &amp;ldquo;filled with theos&amp;rdquo;, or God) for Pirsig than drive for understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Zen was first published, motorcycle travel literature was not yet the identifiable genre it is today. That variety of travelogue began in earnest in 1979 with the appearance of Ted Simon&amp;rsquo;s Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s Travels, the story of a five-year round-the-world odyssey between 1973 and 1977. If Pirsig was a kind of modern Homer, Simon was like Virgil: pagan and worldly, inured in scholarship of prose, yet beset with laurels of deism. &amp;ldquo;Of all the gods in the pantheon,&amp;rdquo; he wrote, &amp;ldquo;Jupiter is the one I fancy most. A lovely name, Jupiter, like cream and honey in the mouth. And a sense of great distance and closeness at the same time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compare that to Pirsig, who wrote in Zen that &amp;ldquo;The primary goal of the Church of Reason... is always Socrates&amp;rsquo; old goal of truth, in its ever-changing forms, as it&amp;rsquo;s revealed by the process of rationality.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why motorcyclists might choose the path of Simon&amp;rsquo;s self-aggrandisement over Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;goal of truth&amp;rdquo;. There was always the temptation to play at being god. While my own pan-American odyssey was underway, I came to recognise a particular mindset in fellow riders: an air of being separate in space and time, of being out of reality and untouchable. There were plenty of vengeful Odins and chaotic brothers of Mars riding into town with conquering on their minds. My own choice of god at the time was the callous and boozy Dionysus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unambiguously foreign, strangely dressed, noisy, incorrigible, we rode our machines across the world as though it were the plains of Troy. We were given beds, food and love &amp;ndash; offerings we accepted as tributes for our appearance on the battlefield. When we left, it was not uncommon for crowds of people to appear to see us off. The effect was inebriating, nectar for the ego. Today, those events put me in mind of Patrick Kavanagh&amp;rsquo;s poem &amp;ldquo;Epic&amp;rdquo;, which ends with the lines: &amp;ldquo;Till Homer&amp;rsquo;s ghost came whispering to my mind. / He said: I made the Iliad from such / A local row. Gods make their own importance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wreaking havoc&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But therein lies the trouble with gods &amp;ndash; they do not go out into the world to learn, but to teach, to wreak havoc, have their way with mortals; they live in the world as they want it, rather than as it is. Passing through one country after another, often without our &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo; documents, and with the freedom of our vehicles, we felt that we had passed beyond the rules of society. I rode all over the Americas illegally, my expired paperwork needing only a few flicks of my pen to change the date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why travelers feel out of step with the world around them. Society is largely based on repetition and reliability, neither of which travel provides. But enough time ignoring the rules and a detached superiority begins to settle in. And then, the worst: bored with the thrills offered by the natural world, by spontaneity, by socialising, such riders turn from life to arithmetic: tallying up miles ridden, countries entered, tyres blown, meals eaten. Quantity becomes synonymous with merit, and the most venerable are those who have &amp;ldquo;done more&amp;rdquo;. As the urge to quantify rises, Quality suffers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simon ends Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s Travels with this reflection: &amp;ldquo;Often I dream of riding over the hard red floor of a great forest, beneath a high canopy of translucent green, spreading on and on. An enchanted forest, perhaps, where men may still sometimes play at being gods.&amp;rdquo; Pirsig ends Zen in a very different manner, by saying that &amp;ldquo;to understand Quality, he would have to leave the mythos.&amp;rdquo; It continues: &amp;ldquo;[he] emerges as if from a dream, seeing that his whole consciousness, the mythos, has been a dream and no one&amp;rsquo;s dream but his own, a dream he must now sustain of his own efforts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is much to admire in motorcycle writing, but too much of it today is a poor imitation of the genre&amp;rsquo;s forefathers. We will not produce another writer like Robert Pirsig until we can differentiate quantity from Quality. And we have to stop playing at being gods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This article is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6085/book-review-the-age-of-the-strongman#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ageofstrongman.jpg" height="697" alt="The Age of the Strongman by Gideon Rachman" width="462"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Age of the Strongman&lt;/strong&gt; (Bodley Head) by Gideon Rachman&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rivalry between democracy and autocracy promises to define much of this century. The Age of the Strongman by the Financial Times&amp;rsquo; chief foreign affairs commentator Gideon Rachman attempts to explain how we got here. The central thrust is that, since the 1990s, the rise of a certain type of leader has become the key feature of &amp;ldquo;the most sustained global assault on liberal democracy since the 1930s&amp;rdquo;. By profiling 14 current-day leaders with authoritarian tendencies &amp;ndash; from central Europe to South America to the Philippines &amp;ndash; Rachman hopes to provide &amp;ldquo;political liberals&amp;rdquo; with an &amp;ldquo;understanding of what they are dealing with&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachman begins with an outline of the &amp;ldquo;playbook&amp;rdquo; that has propelled strongmen into power. A common tactic is populist nationalism, which paints the strongman as a national saviour, pitting an ethnically and/or religiously defined nation against outside threats such as minority groups, migrants or a shadowy elite. In power, the erosion of civil liberties is a natural consequence. Rachman reminds us how strongmen have subjugated ethnic and religious communities in their countries. Whilst China&amp;rsquo;s Xi detains Uyghurs in &amp;ldquo;re-education&amp;rdquo; camps, Narendra Modi has effectively stripped millions of Muslims of their Indian citizenship. Independent institutions and organisations are neutered. While some strongmen, like Viktor Orb&amp;aacute;n, are known for hollowing out their country&amp;rsquo;s independent media, others, like Vladimir Putin, preside over countries where journalists regularly turn up dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachman refuses to explain the rise of this authoritarianism through the talents of strongmen alone, nor does he assert that certain countries are predisposed to this rule. Chapters on Boris Johnson and Donald Trump dispel the myth that the west is impervious to democratic decline. Instead, Rachman argues that the success of strongmen is a &amp;ldquo;symptom of the crisis of liberalism&amp;rdquo;, which has economic, political and diplomatic dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Driving this crisis, according to Rachman, is an &amp;ldquo;overconfidence in the power of liberal ideas born from &amp;lsquo;victory&amp;rsquo; in the Cold War&amp;rdquo;. This prevented politicians and commentators from judging the true character of strongmen early in their careers. Rachman includes himself in this, going so far as to quote from one of his past articles that celebrated Modi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;thrilling&amp;rdquo; rise. The free market&amp;rsquo;s most ardent defenders have since had to reckon with the compatibility of the system with authoritarianism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But despite beginning what promises to be a meaningful critique of the liberal world order, Rachman never quite gets down to it. Instead, he regresses into clich&amp;eacute;. His acknowledgement of the ills of globalisation is descriptive at best. The term &amp;ldquo;neoliberalism&amp;rdquo; is dismissed as an invention of the populist left, as if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the object of serious academic enquiry. Meanwhile, strongman critiques of the liberal world order go unexplored. Grievances against US foreign policy, Nato and the EU &amp;ndash; some of which may be justified &amp;ndash; are dismissed. It is unclear what Rachman has learnt from reckoning with post-Cold War politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This reversion to type is finalised in the book&amp;rsquo;s conclusion, where the strongman is dismissed as a short-lived fad, and we are told to trust the US to lead a new &amp;ldquo;human-rights based world order&amp;rdquo;. Rachman fails to take seriously the US&amp;rsquo; vulnerability to a Trump-like resurgence, or the grisly legacy of its foreign intervention since the Second World War. In the end, his pages are haunted by the same liberal overconfidence he finds complicit in the rise of the strongman. To strengthen liberalism against rising authoritarianism requires tougher questions of its historical record; perhaps even a consideration about the case for reinvention, something Rachman firmly rules out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Is there any value to this unregulated research?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In 2015, at the age of 44, Parrish flew to Bogot&amp;aacute;, Columbia, to receive dozens of experimental gene therapy injections, with the goal of turning back her biological clock. By that time, she had founded her own company, BioViva. For her first public appearance as CEO, she had chosen to address the immortalist group People Unlimited, where she told a receptive crowd that she wanted to cure ageing, and do it fast enough that they could all benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;What dreams may come&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In our obsession with getting more sleep, we are overlooking the strange mysteries of night terrors and other parasomnias, writes Diletta De Cristofaro&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Vernon&amp;rsquo;s reflections on Dracula, the protagonist of Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s 1897 novel, note that he causes paralysis, somnambulism and night terrors in his victims. He was not just a vampire, she concludes, but &amp;ldquo;every parasomnia combined in the figure of a folkloric monster&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The temple of the body &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Weightlifters were once seen as freaks &amp;ndash; but now the fitness industry has taken over the world. Peter Salmon asks, how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In Christianity we are born with sin and spend our lives trying to repay that debt. In capitalism we must keep earning to stop our financial debt growing. This moral imperative is analogous with the prevalent framing of fitness today as an endless and unresolvable quest: one can always be fitter, and not pursuing this goal is a failing to oneself and to society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A: Anna Lembke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The program director of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Fellowship talks to &lt;strong&gt;J.P. O'Malley&lt;/strong&gt; about how to create a healthy pleasure-pain balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;What I have seen over two decades of clinical work is parents who have assiduously insulated their children not just from painful experiences, but really any kind of challenging experiences. This means that children haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to build up the mental strength they need to live in the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The spring 2023 issue of New Humanist is on sale now! &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt; for as little as &amp;pound;10 a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in this issue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2302-38-41-Jain-_1_.jpg" height="1064" alt="Indian widows are standing up for their rights" width="1596"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanket Jain &lt;/strong&gt;meets the women fighting back against India&amp;rsquo;s regressive widowhood traditions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen Stout&lt;/strong&gt; reports from Ukraine, where she joins the search for a missing writer taken by Russian forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt;Sometimes voters get it wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Eliane Glaser &lt;/strong&gt;asks why we find this so hard to admit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Euan Lawson&lt;/strong&gt; makes the case for drug consumption rooms, to tackle the UK's scandalously high rates of drug-related death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samira Ahmed &lt;/strong&gt;dives into the new trend for witch-lit.

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p></div>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;
