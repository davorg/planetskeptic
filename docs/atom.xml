<p class="lead">Years of ignoring Jerry Coyne, a record ruined by the fact that I felt obligated to find out what he’s complaining about in order to address that recent bad article…and what do I find? His usual <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/06/21/the-vexing-problem-of-furries/">half-assed whining about people different from him</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>When I gave a lecture in the Deep South some years ago, I went to dinner with several of the biology faculty, who told me of the occurrence of “furries”  (actually, better known as “otherkins”) among the students. “Otherkins” are students who dress up and act like nonhuman animals in their day-to-day life. But the group the profs were really concerned with were students who identified as animals,  claiming that they had the spirit of animals, insisting on being addressed as the animal they identified with, and wore animal costumes like ears or tails. These are the true “otherkins”. I saw several of these, including one girl who had a horse tail stuck in the back of her pants.  The professors told me that they had been given special instruction by the university on how to treat and deal with the otherkins.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen any otherkins at my University, but this Torygraph article (click on the screenshot to go to the archived piece) notes that it is an issue in Britain, and schools don’t know how to deal with it. I was sent this article by a Brit who couldn’t believe that the phenomenon was real. I assured my correspondent that yes, this is a reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh god. No, it’s not real. Furries/otherkin do exist, but they are fully aware of their identities — they just enjoy role-playing. Seeing a girl with a horsetail stuck in her pants does not mean they’re running around, thinking they are a horse, and that the university needs to provide special instructions for how to deal with them. Just talk to them. You know, like they’re human beings. That works. I’ve even attended a furry convention, and honestly, it’s no more weird than attending a D&amp;D con…or an atheist convention.</p>
<p>What next? Is he going to declare that American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_boxes_in_schools_hoax">schools are putting out kitty litter for the kids who identify as cats</a>?</p>
<p>Anyway, in this case he credulously goes on to tell the story of kids in England thinking they are cats and other animals.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Perhaps tellingly, the incident at Rye College – a Church of England school – happened at the end of a class on “life education” in which children were told by their teacher that there were lots of genders, including “agender – people who don’t believe that they have a gender at all”.</p>
<p>An argument ensued in which two pupils disagreed with the teacher, saying there was no such thing as agender, because “if you have a vagina, you’re a girl and if you have a penis, you’re a boy – that’s it”.</p>
<p>When the pupils told their classmate: “How can you identify as a cat when you’re a girl?” the teacher reprimanded them for “questioning [the child’s] identity”.</p>
<p>In this instance, the teacher in charge of the class appears to have bracketed a child’s desire to be treated as a cat with other children’s desire to be treated as another gender, or genderless.</p></blockquote>
<p>To Coyne, this is evidence of his bigoted presumption that <q>this is a case of social contagion promulgated by both peers and also by teachers who have been indoctrinated by gender activism to accept any child’s assumed identity.</q> Indoctrination! Gender activism! Social contagion!</p>
<p>Except…that’s not what happened at all. It’s all hyper-inflated hyperbole from the UK news media. <a href="https://schoolsweek.co.uk/gender-row-school-none-of-our-pupils-identify-as-a-cat/">The school has said it didn’t happen</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a statement to Schools Week, the trust said it wanted to “clarify that no children at Rye College identifies as a cat or any other animal”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t matter. By then, GB News, the Daily Mail, and Tucker Carlson were promoting the kind of nonsense that finds favor with Coyne, all based on a brief Tik Tok excerpt of a longer discussion held in the classroom. One reporter, <a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2023/06/22/dead-cats-and-transphobic-lies/">Otto English, dug deeper and interviewed one of the people involved</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have taken the time both to establish this individual’s credibility and to safeguard their identity and as such the individual is anonymous and some critical details given to us have been deliberately omitted. I am very aware that the two children who made the recording are also just that – children – and so have taken care to omit details about them and some of the things they are alleged to have said on the day.</p>
<p>I shall refer to the ‘cat’ pupil as ‘Student A’ and the two individuals who made the tape as “B” and “C”.</p>
<p>Our correspondent – present in the room – tells us: <em>I want to make (it) clear that ‘A’ does not identify as a cat</em>.</p>
<p>What, by our source’s account, happened is that there was an ongoing conversation happening between several pupils about identity before B and C engaged with them and – according to our source – as the discussion became increasingly personal and ill-tempered, either B or C then said, apropos of gender: ‘if you identify as a cat or a carrot you are insane’.</p>
<p>In other words, nobody was talking about ‘cats’ until the subject of them was introduced into the conversation by one of the two pupils who later made the recording. This was a broad-ranging conversation about gender and identity between a group of kids in Year 8 which seems to have turned nasty before the teacher intervened.</p>
<p>Our source defends the teacher and says that having started out ‘extremely calm’ she only became ‘irritable’ when the two students became increasingly ‘disrespectful’. </p></blockquote>
<p>That’s it. People can be grumpy when arguing about sex and gender — Coyne should know, he’s a good example. That’s all this was, young people expressing their opinions, and there were no cat-people involved.</p>
<p>It’s simply a British example of the litter boxes in the classroom lie that was spread over here on this side of the Atlantic, and anyone who falls for it should not be taken seriously.</p>

<p>It’s beautiful. That’s the only thing I care about in this photo — I want someone to buy me a fishing junket to Alaska. My dad managed to make a few salmon fishing trips in his last years, and I think they made him happy.</p>
<p>By the way, the guy on the right is a supreme court judge. He got flown on a private plane to this fishing camp, with a billionaire, Paul Singer, footing the $100,000 bill. It paid for Singer to do that, since he had several cases before the court, and got favorable rulings. That fish is a bribe.</p>
<p>It’s looking like Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society goon, is <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/samuel-alito-luxury-fishing-trip-paul-singer-scotus-supreme-court">hooking up each Supreme Court appointee with their very own billionaire sugar daddy</a>. Clarence Thomas got one, Sam Alito got one, I wonder whose patronage each of the other judges got? Somebody had to have paid off Kavanaugh’s loans. I’d like to know who. Let us know who bought each member of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Still, that is a magnificent King Salmon. That’s the price of a corrupt judge? OK, maybe some ethics rules would be good.</p>

    <title>Jerry Coyne’s bogus fears of “ideological subversion”</title>

<p class="lead">I have an unfortunate history with CFI and <i>The Skeptical Inquirer</i>. I ought to be aligned with the principles of skepticism, but too often <em>organized</em> skepticism has been this stodgy, hidebound dinosaur that is more interested in conserving the privileges of a narrow group of people than in actually implementing productive change. So <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/08/04/atheism-is-an-essential-part-of-skepticism/">I abandoned it</a>, writing this in 2011.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Diversity] has long been an issue with the skeptical movement. I used to subscribe to the Skeptical Inquirer, a very good magazine with well-written and substantive articles on skeptical issues, but I let my subscription lapse. It was a strange thing that prompted it; several years ago, there was an issue lauding the leaders of the skeptical movement, and it had a nice line drawing of four or five of these Big Names on the cover: and every one was white, male, and over 70 years old. I looked at it, and I wasn’t mad or outraged — every one of them was a smart guy who deserved recognition — but I saw it, sighed, and felt that not only was this incredibly boring, but that organized skepticism was dead if it was going to turn into a gerontocracy. I didn’t let my subscription lapse in protest, but out of lack of motivation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, a few years ago, <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2020/02/20/kavin-senapathy-fired-by-cfi/">they fired Kavin Senapathy</a>, a huge self-own. I commented on that:</p>
<blockquote><p>That refusal to deal with the biggest social struggles of our time is what has always left me infuriated with the skeptic movement — oh, sure, let’s debunk ghosts and chupacabras and UFOs, but racist and misogynist beliefs are just too hard. They love the magic tricks and tests of dowsing, but eugenics? No one in organized skepticism seems to be smart enough to cope with that.</p>
<p>Merging with the Richard Dawkins Foundation didn’t help, and actually made it worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kavin revealed some rather obvious inside information:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two years ago, in an inept attempt to address the issue, CFI published a special issue of Skeptical Inquirer: “A Skeptic’s Guide to Racism.” The issue, penned exclusively by white men, demonstrated CFI leadership’s woefully shallow grasp of how racism works. In an article on “critical thinking approaches to confronting racism,” the magazine’s deputy editor, Benjamin Radford, referenced the view of evolutionary psychologist and author Steven Pinker that “the overall historical trends for humanity are encouraging”— a view that has been criticized as glossing over the plights of the most marginalized people. Radford’s contribution to the special issue also seemed to ignore the elephant in CFI’s room: He made not even a passing mention of the staggering racial disparities within his own organization — and within the very pages of the publication he was writing for.</p></blockquote>
<p>You get the idea. It’s the whitest, most oblivious skeptical organization, although Shermer’s group is competing well with that status. Worse, they aren’t at all interested in broadening their perspectives and getting better. I publicly announced my departure from the organized skepticism movement over these sorts of differences years ago.</p>
<p>Well, now we have achieved the merger of skepticism with the aggrieved privileged conservative crowd. The Skeptical Inquirer has published an article by Jerry Coyne and Luana Maroja titled <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2023/06/the-ideological-subversion-of-biology/" rel="nofollow">The Ideological Subversion of Biology</a>, which is full of bogus nonsense about how the Progressive Left is <em>strangling</em> science. It’s the same silly crap as that loony <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/21/oh-yuckthat-was-an-awful-paper-by-krylov-and-her-cronies/">In Defense of Merit in Science</a> paper that Coyne coauthored a while ago, and it’s a perfect fit for the Inquirer.</p>
<p>The title is an interesting choice — it’s a blatant call-back to anti-communist hysteria, and will strike a chord with Republicans and MAGAts all across the country. Once upon a time, it was the kind of thing the John Birch Society or Lyndon LaRouche would publish.</p>
<p>It’s really bad. Jerry Coyne has successfully transitioned from respected senior scientist to angry, bitter crank finding common cause with the worst right-wing academic grifters. It’s sad to see.</p>
<p>I’m working on a response to it. Coyne has written a long gish gallop of a paper, so it’s going to take a while, and another thing that’s not helping is that I’m flying off to a 4-day conference this weekend. I’ve also written to the Skeptical Inquirer asking if they’d be interested in publishing a response — I kind of doubt that they will, given their ideological predilections and the fact that they published a load of nonsense in the first place.</p>
<p>Stay tuned. With a few long days at the computer, I might finish a response before my flight on Sunday.</p>

    <title>Could nuclear fusion save the planet?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6132/could-nuclear-fusion-save-the-planet#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Nuclear fusion is the power source of the sun and the stars. Image credit: Andrey Grinkevich" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/andrey-grinkevich-0x6RTts1jRU-unsplash.jpg" height="1080" alt="A bright yellow sun rises over mountains in Nevada" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of excitement lately about harnessing nuclear fusion, the power source of the sun and stars, and so gaining access to limitless green energy. Is it all hype? Well, put it this way. The joke since the 1950s has been that commercial fusion is always 50 years away. Now it appears to be only 30 years away!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what is this promising process, able to produce abundant energy without greenhouse gases? Readers may be more familiar with nuclear fission, the process behind the atomic bomb and nuclear reactors, which involves splitting the core, or &amp;ldquo;nucleus&amp;rdquo;, of a heavy atom, to make lighter nuclei. In nuclear fusion, light nuclei are melded together to make a heavier one. When light nuclei like hydrogen fuse, or heavy nuclei like uranium split, surplus energy gushes out. Pound for pound, a nuclear fuel contains at least a million times as much energy as a &amp;ldquo;chemical fuel&amp;rdquo; like coal or oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why nuclear fusion is so attractive, but let&amp;rsquo;s look at the practicalities. The sun fuses hydrogen into helium, with the by-product being sunlight, but the reaction is far too slow for use on Earth. Instead, the focus has been on gluing together deuterium (a heavy form of hydrogen that is readily available in seawater) with tritium (an even heavier but fast-decaying form, which has to be created by artificial nuclear reactions).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difficulty with fusion is that light nuclei like hydrogen need to be slammed together extremely violently in order to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion, which is ferocious. Such collisions in practice occur only at an extremely high temperature. But, whereas the fusion of hydrogen in the sun requires a temperature of 15 million degrees, the fusion of deuterium and tritium requires a temperature of more than 100 million degrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And herein lies the problem. How do you generate such extraordinary temperatures on Earth without destroying everything in the vicinity?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are two main approaches. One is to confine a super-hot &amp;ldquo;plasma&amp;rdquo; of deuterium and tritium by means of powerful magnetic fields in a machine with a doughnut or &amp;ldquo;torus&amp;rdquo; shape. The other is to compress and heat peppercorn-sized pellets of deuterium and tritium, one after another, by hitting them from all sides with mega-lasers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both fusion methods have scored significant successes of late, which is the reason for the current excitement. In December 2021, at Culham near Oxford, the Joint European Torus (JET) maintained the necessary fusion temperature for 5 seconds. Crucially, 59 million joules of energy more than was put in came out &amp;ndash; enough to boil about 60 kettles. A year later, the US National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California got out 1.1 million joules more than it put in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are undoubtedly milestones on the way to a commercial fusion reactor, but there is a long journey ahead to scale up the technology. JET&amp;rsquo;s successor, the impressively huge International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, funded by 35 countries, is currently under construction in Southern France. But it will be only a test reactor, not a commercial reactor. And if laser-based, or &amp;ldquo;inertial&amp;rdquo;, fusion is ever to be viable, it will need to be able to induce fusion in not just one pellet but several pellets every second.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, it is immensely hard to make a pellet that is perfectly spherical enough that it implodes sufficiently uniformly to create the necessary fusion temperatures. The cost per pellet will also need to come down from its current level of a few hundred thousand dollars to a few tens of cents. The challenges are substantial, but so is the promised reward: unlimited energy from seawater, one of the most abundant resources on the planet, with no greenhouse gases generated, at least not directly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to be clear when it comes to green credentials. It is not quite true that nuclear fusion has no radioactive waste problems. Neutrons escaping from the fusion reactions cannot be confined by magnetic fields, on account of being electrically neutral, and will inevitably make the material of any containment vessel radioactive. Fusion proponents, however, say the radioactivity will not be as long-lived and problematic as from fission reactors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If all goes to plan, a new era of clean and plentiful energy will dawn in the 2050s, with the construction of the first commercial fusion reactors. Unless, of course, some unexpected hitch occurs, flipping that horizon back to its perennial 50-year state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Surrender by Bono</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6131/book-review-surrender-by-bono#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Our reviewer hopes for a second volume" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bono.jpg" height="748" alt="The cover art for 'Surrender' includes a black and white, close-up photo of Bono as a younger man" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story&lt;/strong&gt; (Hutchinson Heinemann) by Bono&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll memoirs are the telling of a miracle. If a musician has succeeded to the point that anybody believes their memoir worth publishing, they have triumphed over the colossal odds that stand against any bunch of earnest, spotty youths, feeling their way around instruments they can barely play, ever amounting to anything much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story related by U2 frontman Bono in &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, as its author understands, is remarkable even by that measure. The chances of Dublin teenagers gathering to make a racket in a suburban kitchen in 1976 becoming, within a decade or so, the biggest rock band in the world were virtually nil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is a series of recollections and digressions attached to 40 songs from U2&amp;rsquo;s catalogue. Though the book is more or less chronological, each chapter feels self-contained: a sketch, a parable, a confession and/or a funny story. Over the course of a long and extraordinary career, Bono has amassed a wealth of anecdotage. He relates his material with the instinctive skill of a born yarn-spinner, and an air of self-deprecating befuddlement that any of this somehow happened. There were, of course, any number of reasons why it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it did. So, Mikhail Gorbachev pitches up on his Dublin doorstep clutching an enormous teddy bear. George W. Bush gives him something of a wigging in the Oval Office. He gets repeatedly out-drunk by Frank Sinatra. He relates his encounters with the elites of entertainment, politics, tech, media and finance with deftly turned character portraits. Rupert Murdoch is &amp;ldquo;a sophisticated thinker, camouflaged by colloquialisms; Australian&amp;rdquo;, Nelson Mandela is &amp;ldquo;a wellspring of joy that defied the weight he carried&amp;rdquo;, Johnny Cash &amp;ldquo;the heavyweight champion of every room he entered except the one that contained June Carter&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is an echo in the latter aper&amp;ccedil;u of another key theme of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;. It is a book about women, although not in the way that memoirs by male rock stars often are. Specifically, it is to a large extent a book about two women. One is Iris Hewson, Bono&amp;rsquo;s mother, who died suddenly when Bono was 14: a recurring motif of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, as it is of U2&amp;rsquo;s catalogue, is Bono grappling with the uncomfortable thought that this tragedy might somehow have catalysed his success. The other is Ali Hewson, Bono&amp;rsquo;s wife: the pair met at school, and married in their early 20s. Bono still sounds like a man touchingly terrified of what might have become of him otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is not merely a great memoir by the usually lackadaisical standards of rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll autobiography. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book about music and politics, family and friendship, pride and ambition, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t wear thin even at nearly 600 pages. Indeed, there are sufficient omissions &amp;ndash; and certainly enough U2 songs &amp;ndash; to warrant a second volume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As someone present at both extraordinary occasions, I was surprised to find little reference to U2&amp;rsquo;s show at Ko&amp;scaron;evo Stadium in Sarajevo in 1997, 18 months after the lifting of the siege of the city, or their three-night stand at Madison Square Garden in New York in 2001, six weeks after 9/11 &amp;ndash; events at which U2&amp;rsquo;s rare gift for channelling a moment triumphed in difficult, volatile circumstances which most bands of their stature might have preferred not to confront.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting stretches of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; are those that reflect on the conundrums and contradictions which arise when one attempts to apply the idealism of rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll to the realities of politics. In both realms, Bono talks about the search for the &amp;ldquo;top-line melody&amp;rdquo;, the irresistible riff that lodges an idea, a sentiment, a mood in people&amp;rsquo;s heads, and sends them away humming it whether they really want to or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To a degree confounding its title, &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; serves as a brisk primer in the art of getting stuff actually done. It turns out to necessitate much the same boneheaded determination and unwillingness to shut up that drive a teenager aboard the boat-train from Dublin to London to spend days schlepping from indifferent promoter to baffled journalist with a demo tape. Though U2&amp;rsquo;s songs have not been short on utopian sloganeering, especially early on, their singer evolved into a pragmatic and effective advocate, and &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is also the story of a political education, as instructed by many of the most influential figures of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did once ask Bono if he entertained any ambitions of political office himself, and suggested that Ireland&amp;rsquo;s largely ceremonial presidency might be suitable; he replied that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to move to a smaller house. Like many of his insights into the absurdity and opportunity of an unlikely life as a mega-celebrity, it&amp;rsquo;s funny because it&amp;rsquo;s true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here for access to the full magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Martin Wolf on the crisis of democratic capitalism</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6130/martin-wolf-on-the-crisis-of-democratic-capitalism#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Martin-Wolf-author-image-sq.jpeg" height="1368" alt="Martin Wolf" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin Wolf is chief economics commentator at the "Financial Times". He was awarded the CBE in 2000 &amp;ldquo;for services to financial journalism&amp;rdquo; and in 2019 won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Gerald Loeb Awards. His latest book is &amp;ldquo;The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism&amp;rdquo; (Allen Lane). Here, he speaks to J. P. O&amp;rsquo; Malley about democratic capitalism and the greatest threats to peace and prosperity in the west.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You define democratic capitalism &amp;ldquo;as the combination of liberal democracy with market capitalism.&amp;rdquo; You believe they have to work together. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you have to look at this historically. In complex organised societies, the dominant form of wealth was land. Those who controlled the land usually also controlled the armies, which meant they controlled power, and the people, the majority of whom worked for them. Over the last two centuries, a market economy became the dominant form for creating wealth. In this economic system, which replaced feudalism, a new capitalist elite was born in which everybody had a right to try to become a capitalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that sense, it was egalitarian. Obviously, though, most people didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;make it&amp;rdquo;. But we eventually ended up with universal suffrage and democracy &amp;hellip; Crucially, capitalism created the social and economic conditions that [helped produce] a society in which people have equal value and equal merit. I believe democracy prevents capitalism from becoming a predatory plutocracy. Just as a market economy prevents a state from becoming an autocracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t international trade and capital flows (the movement of money for investment and trade) pose a serious challenge to this system?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the core tensions in democratic capitalism is that democracy is bound up with a territorial jurisdiction. Namely: you are a citizen of one country to which you are most attached, and to which you pay your taxes. But from its beginning, capitalism has had a transnational aspect. Because market opportunities exist across the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The level of prosperity that most of us now expect demands a very high level of international trade. Moreover, an essential part of international commerce is foreign investment, which allows capital to spread out across the world. A combination of trade and foreign investment has accelerated big social and economic changes in western societies, particularly with regards to deindustrialisation. This has seen the labour force in industry shrinking everywhere, though this is mainly because we can produce more and more goods with fewer and fewer people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the biggest source of instability to the global economy in recent years has been capital flows. Particularly in the uncontrolled financial sector, which was really what was behind the global financial crisis, which had a devastating long-term impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I believe we can still sustain a liberal democratic capitalist system, while having open economies. In fact, there&amp;rsquo;s no real alternative for us. An open international economy is going to be beneficial for most of humanity. It gives tremendous opportunities for development. And we&amp;rsquo;ve got to try and do better to manage the consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your latest book, &amp;ldquo;The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism&amp;rdquo;, proposes ways to beat tax dodging by multinational corporations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tax reform is one of the big issues. We need to have land [value] taxes [taxing the rental value of land]. They&amp;rsquo;re very easy to impose actually. A lot of the value created by the corporate sector, and by investment more broadly, ends up in land values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With regards to corporation tax, my view is that there is a legitimate case for allowing investment spending to be deducted from the tax base, because you want corporations to invest. But the rate of tax on profits which are uninvested should align with the top income tax. When you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with internationally mobile factors of production, which are very difficult to tax easily in an open mobile economy, where capital moves quickly, then the obvious thing to do is to reach international agreements. This will lead to further efforts to eliminate tax havens. But, more importantly, to agree on a common basis for tax, which could help raise substantially more revenue from corporations and their owners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also address the challenges faced by the World Trade Organization since it was founded in 1995. Why has cooperation not worked out as planned?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, the WTO was built around the idea that it would be possible to create a set of rules that governed all of world trade. That became more difficult, however, as the world started to divide into blocks, with the west on the one side, and China on the other. That makes it very difficult to run global trade rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of this became very politically sensitive because globalisation had not benefited everyone. That has led to a political backlash, particularly in the United States, where the welfare state is weak. The policy solution for the US has been to become more protectionist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What should have happened over the last fifteen years was a way for the west to bring the Chinese regime closer to our system. It was not impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it never happened. So we now have this rather unique problem, where we have this huge economic player &amp;ndash; China &amp;ndash; which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to fit into the underlying principles of liberal democratic capitalism, as we understand it. The Americans see this in geopolitical terms. And if you add those two things together, the WTO ceases to function, to cover all of global trade. The global order underpinning global capitalism from 1990 to 2007 has now gone. That is obvious. The question remains: how do we manage this process of reversal?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest threats to peace and prosperity in the west today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no doubt we are going through an enormously challenging period in global affairs. The war in Ukraine has created economic chaos. We also have the relationship between China and Russia and the adversarial relationship between China and the United States. It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to predict how it is all going to end up. The outcomes are potentially very dangerous. Namely: extreme global nuclear war. I&amp;rsquo;m not forecasting that. But it&amp;rsquo;s clearly a threat that is very real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the west needs to protect its political system and its economies. That means basic economic and military security. It also requires some reconsiderations of our trade relations with the rest of the world, particularly with China. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we should stop trade altogether with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, we have to be sure that a Chinese influence does not infringe on our own freedoms or interfere with our own institutions. Managing relationships with rival powers is also important. The west has failed with Russia. We cannot fail with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the climate crisis? How does the west&amp;rsquo;s relationship with China factor in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have an obligation to look after our shared planet. For the first time in history, human beings are reshaping the planet in very dramatic ways. Notably, the extreme damage that is being done to the climate system, the oceans and the biosphere. China is also part of that. We cannot solve these problems without China. It is, after all, the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. China is probably more responsible for overfishing than any other country too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But we have to compete and cooperate, while avoiding actually conflicting with China. Historically, relationships like this have often, but not always, ended up in war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relations between the United States and China are now really bad. Particularly from the American side, which has become quite paranoid. That is stupendously dangerous. And if we don&amp;rsquo;t manage that, all the rest of the arguments I present in my book will become irrelevant, because we won&amp;rsquo;t have a world that is worth living in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The paralysing pessimism of Critical Race Theory</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6129/the-paralysing-pessimism-of-critical-race-theory#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'Open Casket' on display in New York. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Malik.jpg" height="1026" alt="'Open Casket', a 2016 painting by Dana Schutz" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Black people are the magical faces at the bottom of society&amp;rsquo;s well. Even the poorest whites, those who must live their lives only a few levels above, gain their self-esteem by gazing down on us. Surely, they must know that their deliverance depends on letting down their ropes. Only by working together is escape possible. Over time, many reach out, but most simply watch, mesmerized into maintaining their unspoken commitment to keeping us where we are, at whatever cost to them, as to us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is the arresting image that opens Derrick Bell&amp;rsquo;s 1992 book &lt;em&gt;Faces at the Bottom of the Well&lt;/em&gt;. It is a work of existential despair, but, for Bell, the only realistic way of thinking about the place in which African Americans find themselves. Racism, he wrote, &amp;ldquo;is an integral, permanent and indestructible component of this society&amp;rdquo;. Black people &amp;ldquo;will never gain full equality&amp;rdquo;. Even &amp;ldquo;those herculean efforts we hail as successful will produce no more than temporary &amp;lsquo;peaks of progress&amp;rsquo;, short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance as racial patterns adapt in ways that maintain white dominance. This is a hard-to-accept fact that all history verifies.&amp;rdquo; Not to accept that fact was to do great mental and emotional harm. Since &amp;ldquo;racial equality is&amp;hellip; not a realistic goal&amp;rdquo;, to be &amp;ldquo;constantly aiming for a status that is unobtainable in a perilously racist America&amp;rdquo; would lead only to &amp;ldquo;frustration and despair&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Derrick Bell is not a household name. Yet few people have been more important in shaping contemporary thinking about race, particularly in the United States. From Barack Obama to Ta-Nehisi Coates, leading black thinkers have paid tribute to Bell&amp;rsquo;s inspiration. There are not many legal scholars in recent memory, wrote Michelle Alexander, the influential author of &lt;em&gt;The New Jim Crow&lt;/em&gt;, who &amp;ldquo;have [had] a greater impact on racial justice thought and advocacy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell is the godfather of what is now called Critical Race Theory (CRT). Beginning as a movement within American legal studies that brought a postmodern sensibility to thinking about the law, CRT developed into a critique of the liberal &amp;ldquo;civil rights&amp;rdquo; approach to tackling racism, a critique nurtured by a hostility to universalism, humanism and the Enlightenment. &amp;ldquo;Enlightenment-style Western democracy is&amp;hellip; the source of black people&amp;rsquo;s subordination,&amp;rdquo; wrote Richard Delgado, one of the movement&amp;rsquo;s founders, because &amp;ldquo;racism and enlightenment [sic] are the same thing&amp;rdquo;. Many of the themes that CRT champions &amp;ndash; the centrality of race, rather than of class, to discussions about social issues; the view of racism as a problem of whiteness; the significance of &amp;ldquo;white privilege&amp;rdquo;; the disparagement of the Enlightenment legacy; the politicisation of identity &amp;ndash; became much more widely suffused in 21st-century debates about race and racism, moulding thinkers from Ibram X. Kendi to Robin DiAngelo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell&amp;rsquo;s pessimism, and the arguments underpinning Critical Race Theory, were shaped by the specific conditions of America: the history of slavery, the depth of Jim Crow culture in the South, as well as disenchantment with the limited change in the material conditions of black people&amp;rsquo;s lives brought about by the civil rights movement. But these arguments have since become influential well beyond the US. Across the globe, debates about race are often unreflectingly shaped by ideas and movements originating in the US, whether Black Power in the 1960s or the contemporary culture wars. That influence, underpinned by America&amp;rsquo;s economic, political and cultural weight, makes it important that we look even more carefully at those ideas and developments, unpack the myths and unpick the arguments. In understanding the American debates we understand more also about the debates beyond the US, including in our own country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The godfather of Critical Race Theory&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Born in Pittsburgh in 1930, Bell attended the University of Pittsburgh&amp;rsquo;s law school, the only black graduate in his class, before becoming an attorney in the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. As part of the civil rights assault on Jim Crow, Bell supervised the desegregation of more than 300 schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Desegregation often led to white flight, as white families moved elsewhere rather than send their children to integrated institutions. The result was that many desegregated schools remained segregated, not by formal procedure but through informal practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This conundrum led Bell to question whether it was truly possible to rid society of racism. He had taken his first step on the road to racial pessimism. In 1969, Bell joined Harvard Law School. At the end of the decade, he published perhaps his most celebrated paper, challenging the conventional view of Brown v Board of Education, the famous 1954 Supreme Court case that invalidated state-sanctioned segregated schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Desegregation was not the consequence of a moral desire for racial equality, Bell insisted, but a pragmatic response to political needs, a recognition that segregation hindered &amp;ldquo;America&amp;rsquo;s struggle with communist countries to win the hearts and minds of emerging third world people&amp;rdquo; and was &amp;ldquo;a barrier to further industrialization in the South&amp;rdquo;. Racial progress only occurred when it aligned with white interests, and when those interests changed, any attachment to equality was ditched. Whites, he wrote, &amp;ldquo;simply cannot envision the personal responsibility and the potential sacrifice&amp;hellip; that true equality for blacks will require.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In reality, desegregation was the product of many developments. The American authorities were certainly worried about the image created by Jim Crow and wanted to minimise its propaganda value to the Soviet Union. Desegregation was also a response to the long struggle, not just by black Americans, against racism. The recognition of the immorality of American apartheid played its role, too. And the overthrow of Jim Crow, while it did not bring about the kind of equality African Americans hoped for, nevertheless helped reset the moral dial. The attitude of most Americans to issues from equality to interracial marriage was very different by the end of the century than it had been in the era of Jim Crow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Bell&amp;rsquo;s view, however, because racism was ineradicable, not only would antiracist action &amp;ldquo;not lead to transcendent change&amp;rdquo; but it &amp;ldquo;may indeed, despite our best efforts, be of more help to the system we despise than to the victims of that system whom we are trying to help.&amp;rdquo; And yet, he insisted, antiracists must continue struggling against racism even as they acknowledged that there could be no prospect of success. They had to combine &amp;ldquo;recognition of the futility of action&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;the unalterable conviction that something must be done, that action must be taken&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The well of despair&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Few who were inspired by Bell&amp;rsquo;s work tumbled as far as he did into the well of despair, but pessimism has nevertheless shaped much contemporary thinking about race. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time we ask ourselves: What if Bell was right?&amp;rdquo;, Michelle Alexander reflected in a foreword to a new edition of &lt;em&gt;Faces at the Bottom of the Well&lt;/em&gt; in 2018. &amp;ldquo;What if justice for the dark faces at &amp;lsquo;the bottom of the well&amp;rsquo; can&amp;rsquo;t actually be won in the United States? &amp;hellip; What if racism is permanent? What if?&amp;rdquo; It is a pessimism rooted in many trends: the left&amp;rsquo;s disenchantment with the Enlightenment and with the working class, the degradation of the universalist tradition, the institutionalisation of neoliberalism, the enervation of the labour movement. Like Bell himself, Alexander insists that &amp;ldquo;accepting the permanence of racism in this country does not mean accepting racism&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet challenging racism while at the same time believing it to be ineradicable has inevitably shaped the character of antiracism today. It has prompted a shift from campaigns for material change to demands for symbolic gestures and representational fairness. After all, if racism is permanent, and attempts to eliminate it futile, then antiracism becomes reduced to little more than a kind of public performance or finger-wagging at white people to make them feel guilty or, at best, an attempt to make the unfairness a little less unfair. &amp;ldquo;These days&amp;rdquo;, as influential sociologist and cultural theorist Paul Gilroy has observed, identity too often &amp;ldquo;ceases to be an ongoing process of self-making and social interaction&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;becomes instead a thing to be possessed and displayed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also becomes a thing to be guarded and policed. For, if racism is permanent and ineradicable, then combatting it cannot be about winning equality but can only be about carving out a space within which one can assert a degree of power and autonomy. Hence the demand to &amp;ldquo;Stay in your lane&amp;rdquo;. Perhaps no issue expresses this better than the controversy over &amp;ldquo;cultural appropriation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the evening of 24 August 1955, 14-year-old African American Emmett Till went with some friends to Bryant&amp;rsquo;s Grocery in Money, Mississippi. Living in Chicago, he had come to Mississippi to visit relatives. He walked into the shop and bought two cents&amp;rsquo; worth of bubble gum. Witnesses claimed that Till flirted with the white shop owner, Carolyn Bryant. Four days after the alleged incident, in the dead of night, her husband Roy Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam, who had been out of town on a trucking job, drove to the house where Till was staying and kidnapped the boy. They beat him up and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and dumping the body in the Tallahatchie River. The following month, an all-white jury found Bryant and Milam not guilty of murder. Protected against double jeopardy, the two men admitted in a 1956 interview with &lt;em&gt;Look&lt;/em&gt; magazine that they had tortured and murdered the boy. They received $4,000 for their story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Till&amp;rsquo;s mother Mamie Elizabeth Till-Mobley insisted on an open casket at her son&amp;rsquo;s funeral to expose to the world the savagery of lynchings. She invited photographers to capture the mutilated body. &amp;ldquo;I wanted the world to see what they did to my baby,&amp;rdquo; she said. Fifty thousand people saw Emmett Till&amp;rsquo;s disfigured body as it lay in its open casket in church. Millions more saw the photographs in &lt;em&gt;Jet&lt;/em&gt; magazine, causing shock and outrage. Emmett Till, and the haunting photographs of his broken body, became an indelible, almost ineffable, symbol for the burgeoning civil rights movement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than half a century later, the murder of Emmett Till generated another kind of controversy &amp;ndash; a debate over who should be allowed to depict black pain and for what reason. The 2022 biopic &lt;em&gt;Till&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Chinonye Chukwu, faced questions about whether art should be &amp;ldquo;made from the trauma of American anti-Blackness&amp;rdquo;, as one British reviewer put it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who owns black pain?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five years earlier this question had been posed even more sharply when the artist Dana Schutz painted &amp;ldquo;Open Casket&amp;rdquo;, an image of Till in his coffin, drawn from the photographs. The painting was included in the 2017 Whitney Biennial Exhibition in New York. Many objected to a white painter depicting such a traumatic moment in black history. The British artist Hannah Black organized a petition to have the work destroyed. &amp;ldquo;Although Schutz&amp;rsquo;s intention may be to present white shame,&amp;rdquo; her open letter read, &amp;ldquo;this shame is not correctly represented as a painting of a dead Black boy by a white artist.&amp;rdquo; According to Black, &amp;ldquo;the subject matter is not Schutz&amp;rsquo;s; white free speech and white creative freedom have been founded on the constraint of others, and are not natural rights.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few months later, the novelist Zadie Smith stood in front of the painting with her children. Schutz&amp;rsquo;s work did not impress her &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel very much&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but she pondered whether she, a biracial British woman, was deemed black enough for the subject matter to be hers? And what of her children? Their father is white: &amp;ldquo;by the old racial classifications of America, they are &amp;lsquo;quadroons&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Are my children too white to engage with black suffering?&amp;rdquo;, Smith wondered. &amp;ldquo;How black is black enough?&amp;rdquo; And what about Hannah Black herself? She, like Smith, is a British biracial woman. Is she &amp;ldquo;black enough to write this letter&amp;rdquo;, demanding the painting be destroyed, Smith mused. &amp;ldquo;Who owns black pain?&amp;rdquo; Smith was attempting both to untangle the absurdities of racial categories and to push back the inclination to evaluate moral rights by virtue of the group to which individuals are deemed to belong &amp;ndash; a practice inextricably bound with racial thinking, and its horrors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cultural appropriation has been defined as the &amp;ldquo;unauthorized use of another culture&amp;rsquo;s dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc&amp;rdquo; and as &amp;ldquo;an expression of privilege&amp;rdquo; which exposes that while &amp;ldquo;people of color are forced to adopt elements of mainstream white culture, white people can sample at the buffet of other cultures at their leisure, picking and choosing what they wish to consume.&amp;rdquo; The first quote is from law professor Susan Scafidi, the second from sociologist Nicki Lisa Cole, both based in the US, but these are common definitions in and outside of America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In such discussions, every culture is viewed as a fixed, self-contained unit, every culture separated from every other by a sharp discontinuity, every culture possessing a specific set of traits and forms. But what does it mean for music or a cuisine &amp;ndash; or &amp;ldquo;pain&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; to &amp;ldquo;belong&amp;rdquo; to a culture? And who gives permission for someone from another culture to use such cultural forms?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are few answers to such questions because the debate about cultural appropriation is less about ownership than about gatekeeping &amp;ndash; about the tacit rules that define social boundaries, and the legitimacy of carrying cultural baggage across those boundaries. Every society has its gatekeepers, whose role it is to protect certain institutions, maintain the privileges of particular groups and cordon off some beliefs from challenge. Gatekeepers shield not the marginalised but the powerful. Racism itself is a form of gatekeeping, a means of denying racialised groups equal rights, access and opportunities. The policing of cultural appropriation is no different, though the polarities have been reversed, and it is executed in the name of antiracism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many critics of cultural appropriation insist that they are opposed not to cultural engagement, but to racism. They want to protect marginalised cultures and to ensure that such cultures speak for themselves and are not simply seen through the eyes of more privileged groups. They want also to ensure that it is not white people but minorities that profit from the promotion of their culture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is true that cultural engagement does not take place on a level playing field but is shaped by racism and inequality. Racism ensured, for instance, that the great black pioneers of rock &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll rarely received their due, whereas many white artists, from Elvis Presley onwards, were feted as cultural icons. Yet, as poet, writer and activist Amiri Baraka has observed, the issue here is not that of cultural appropriation at all. &amp;ldquo;If the Beatles tell me that they learned everything they know from Blind Willie [Johnson]&amp;rdquo;, he told the cultural critic Leonard Schwartz in a radio discussion, &amp;ldquo;I want to know why Blind Willie is still running an elevator in Jackson, Mississippi. It&amp;rsquo;s that kind of inequality that is abusive, not the actual appropriation of culture because that&amp;rsquo;s normal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baraka is highlighting the distinction between campaigns that seek to transform the material conditions of African Americans and campaigns for &amp;ldquo;recognition&amp;rdquo; or for the policing of racial boundaries. The campaigns against cultural appropriation expose how the first has been abandoned for the second. Preventing the Beatles from drawing on the work of Blind Willie Johnson would have done little to improve black people&amp;rsquo;s lives. It would not have overthrown Jim Crow laws in the 1950s. It would not rid America of discrimination in the labour market today. Nor will preventing Dana Schutz &amp;ldquo;profiting&amp;rdquo; from painting Emmett Till protect the Emmett Tills of today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equally troubling is that a campaign such as that against Schutz&amp;rsquo;s work contains, as the American critic Adam Shatz has observed, an &amp;ldquo;implicit disavowal that acts of radical sympathy, and imaginative identification, are possible across racial lines&amp;rdquo;. African-American history, Shatz insists, following in the path of Frederick Douglass and WEB Du Bois and James Baldwin, &amp;ldquo;is American history&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;confronting it [is] a common burden&amp;rdquo;. That is precisely the perspective that has been lost through the retreat from the universalist standpoint.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As novelist Kamila Shamsie pointed out, in response to a different controversy over cultural appropriation, losing this universal standpoint is a dangerous thing. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;You &amp;ndash; other &amp;ndash; are unimaginable&amp;rsquo; is a far more problematic attitude than &amp;lsquo;You are imaginable&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an edited excerpt from Kenan Malik&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &amp;ldquo;Not So Black and White&amp;rdquo; (C Hurst &amp;amp; Co), printed in the summer 2023 edition of New Humanist. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe now to access the full magazine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Farewell to coal country</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Liberty Gas Station, Mount Storm. Credit: Dominic Hinde" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Liberty-Gas-Station-Mount-Storm-copy.jpg" height="1440" alt="A photo shows a gas station with wind turbines behind it in Mount Storm" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Most of the people here really don&amp;rsquo;t believe in what is happening with our climate,&amp;rdquo; Jerry Whisner says to me matter-of-factly over his desk in the offices of the Mineral County Commission in Keyser, West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whisner is a Republican and a native son of the county he leads, sandwiched in the mountains where West Virginia meets Maryland on the Upper Potomac River. This is &amp;ndash; or at least used to be &amp;ndash; coal country, and loyalty to mining runs deep. Every day coal trains nearly two miles long rumble up the Potomac valley on their way to the coast from the handful of still-active extraction sites. Old habits die hard, and places like Keyser are ground zero in the fight to pull America kicking and screaming towards carbon neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whisner has more important things to think about than carbon emissions. Keyser is in a region decimated by America&amp;rsquo;s opioid crisis. He believes that economic decline has made West Virginia a prime market for predatory drug gangs, and is lobbying for an interstate highway to create more jobs. Former US President Donald Trump is still popular here, despite the scandals that have dogged him. A big part of the appeal is his deep disdain for the environmental regulation that many West Virginians blame for the rapid decline of the mining sector. &amp;ldquo;Anyone that stands up and says they&amp;rsquo;re gonna bring back coal in West Virginia is great,&amp;rdquo; says Whisner, who used to be a card-carrying Democrat but jumped ship over what he saw as metropolitan dominance by coastal elites in the party.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everywhere I stop on my trip through America this is a familiar refrain, as voting patterns solidify along the urban-rural divide and educational attainment rather than economic status. Driving from Washington DC to Chicago across America&amp;rsquo;s rust belt, it is clear that the fight to wean America off carbon is about much more than just green investments and reducing emissions. The target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, outlined in the Paris Agreement, has become another front in the culture wars that the Republicans have orchestrated around wedge issues, from abortion rights to gun control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his first day in office in 2021, President Joe Biden reversed Trump&amp;rsquo;s populist withdrawal from the Paris treaty four years earlier. In 2022, after much horse-trading, the president finally pushed through the landmark Inflation Reduction Act. With $369 billion earmarked for climate change mitigation and energy security, it is the single biggest piece of climate funding in American history. The name of the package was all part of the hard sell by the White House to sceptical Democrats and a public more concerned about food prices and energy costs than climate science, but the legislation aims to cut US emissions by 40 per cent by 2040.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where are the jobs?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Mineral County because the area has been lavished with attention by the east coast press as an example of what life after coal looks like for the America of tomorrow. West Virginia alone is set to benefit from $240 million of investment in clean energy under the IRA, and Mineral County is already the site of a huge wind farm. There&amp;rsquo;s just one problem though &amp;ndash; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t create any jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The wind farm employs about three people,&amp;rdquo; Whisner says when I ask him about what green transition looks like in the valley. The only benefit the town sees is a small community fund that dishes out a few thousand dollars at a time to compensate for the county&amp;rsquo;s chronic lack of tax funds. The company that owns the wind farm is based in California and is ultimately an asset of French oil giant Total. Their press officer declined my request to speak to any of the local employees, citing tensions on the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunting for any sign that Keyser might yet be the hotbed of green renewal it has been portrayed as, in the window of a run-down theatre in Keyser&amp;rsquo;s main street I spot a placard reading CLIMATE VOTER. It belongs to Steven Satimi, a Californian who moved to West Virginia to set up a distillery on a farm in the steep-sided Appalachian valleys and who runs the community art space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are a few people that would support us and maybe do come in here because they see that sign,&amp;rdquo; sighs Satimi, &amp;ldquo;but it&amp;rsquo;s like a new food, they just prefer to stay away from it. There&amp;rsquo;s some prejudgement when you have a sign on the door like that, and that&amp;rsquo;s just how it is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about decarbonisation in Mineral County is a challenge when the populace has swung heavily behind Trump&amp;rsquo;s robust fossil fuel Republicanism. Even local Democratic senator Joe Manchin &amp;ndash; the last relic of a time when blue-collar Democrats dominated in the state &amp;ndash; owns millions of dollars of coal shares and takes campaign funding from the state&amp;rsquo;s powerful coal lobby. Manchin&amp;rsquo;s intransigence was the main reason it took two years for the White House to make the IRA a reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Driving south out of Keyser I hit a classic example of what climate finance experts call a &amp;ldquo;stranded asset&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in this case literally &amp;ndash; and one of the reasons the campaign dollars have flowed to Manchin and other friends of coal in Washington. Three thousand feet above sea level on a plateau in the Appalachians sits Mount Storm power station, a gargantuan private coal plant that is having to reach further and further afield to feed its furnaces as the mines around it close. How long the plant can survive is uncertain. Up the hill sits its nominal replacement, the colossal Mount Storm wind farm owned by the same multinational as the installation above Keyser. Just like in Keyser, though, the local community sees little benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You get some engineers coming by occasionally,&amp;rdquo; says the woman behind the till of the local Liberty petrol station with its star-spangled frontage, &amp;ldquo;but there&amp;rsquo;s nobody here getting rich off of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Is Keyser the 'hotbed of green renewal' it's been made out to be? Credit: Famartin" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Keyser-WV.jpg" height="600" alt="A street in Keyser, West Virginia" width="800"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Married to the miner'&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Down at the other end of the state lies Charleston, West Virginia&amp;rsquo;s modest state capital. With its maze of roads and industrial lots, it looks identical to a hundred other small cities across America. Strung out along the banks of the Kanawha River, it sits in the middle of one of the country&amp;rsquo;s biggest coalfields. But even here, closures, increasing efficiencies and a dwindling workforce mean that the writing is on the wall for the black stuff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pride of place on the campus of West Virginia&amp;rsquo;s state legislature is given to a statue of a coal worker, but the image of the West Virginian miner as the bedrock of the economy and the state&amp;rsquo;s identity is at odds with the reality of the industry today. Work is often temporary and dangerous, with owners cutting corners to maximise profit and with better careers available outside the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The complexities of the state&amp;rsquo;s relationship with coal are laid bare by Brandon Steele, a member of the West Virginia lower house who represents Raleigh County in the southern heartlands of West Virginia coal country. Born into a mining family, Steele is anti-abortion, pro-gun and deeply suspicious of the federal government, but he is also under no illusions about which way the wind is blowing. He moved out of state to train as a lawyer rather than going down a mine, and it opened his eyes to how far behind West Virginia was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with going into the 21st century is a world economy that, by and large, wants to develop cleaner energy and wants to be carbon neutral,&amp;rdquo; says Steele, as he guides me down the grand corridors of the West Virginia Capitol. The golden-domed building is the tallest in the state, built during the region&amp;rsquo;s industrial heyday, but it now feels more like an underfunded public museum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right now we&amp;rsquo;re the fifth largest energy producer in the nation and we&amp;rsquo;re 91 per cent coal,&amp;rdquo; he points out. &amp;ldquo;A company moving in will look at that and say they can&amp;rsquo;t meet their environmental, social and governance guidance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a recent debate, Steele shocked some of his colleagues when he said that West Virginians considered coal a &amp;ldquo;deity&amp;rdquo; and that this hindered their ability to think clearly about the future. &amp;ldquo;I am not married to the mineral; I am married to the miner,&amp;rdquo; Steele tells me. &amp;ldquo;The miner is the one that needs the job. The miner is the one going home at the end of the day trying to keep the lights on. That&amp;rsquo;s who I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta look out for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The IRA means that at least some of the miners Steele talks about will have alternative careers to turn to. Green Power, a startup making electric school buses thanks to a staggering $4 billion in IRA rebates for schools across America, aims to create 900 jobs and put West Virginian engineering at the heart of every American community. When I meet him in Charleston&amp;rsquo;s freeway-bordered downtown it is not obvious that Green Power&amp;rsquo;s VP Mark Nestlen is a vital cog in America&amp;rsquo;s roadmap to carbon neutrality. The Oklahoma native talks mostly in the manner of a strategic investor, but his enthusiasm for industrial transition is real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People are thanking us for investing here,&amp;rdquo; says Nestlen, &amp;ldquo;and what we have found is that communities will rally around green tech companies that can come in and provide jobs for folks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the core aims of the IRA is to reduce American dependence on Chinese and European renewable technology, handing billions in direct and indirect funding to electric vehicle makers for production and energy technology research. Even in carbon-loving West Virginia that is welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leaving West Virginia behind, I take the freeway over state lines into Kentucky and towards Ohio. Appalachian coal used to fuel the mills and factories stretching out along the border of the three states, and as America&amp;rsquo;s fossil economy grew exponentially the entire basin of the Ohio River that links them was transformed into an industrial powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, though, many of the mills are gone, leaving behind a toxic legacy. The river is now one of America&amp;rsquo;s most polluted, dealing with a poisonous combination of industrial waste, agricultural contamination and mining runoff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;img title="The West Virginia Coal Miner outside the capitol. Credit: US Library of Congress" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/West-Virginia-miner.jpg" height="499" alt="'The West Virginia Coal Miner', a statue outside the state capitol in Charleston" width="500"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Glimpses of the future&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Cincinnati, on the river&amp;rsquo;s north bank, I navigate the labyrinth of slip roads and viaducts to the city&amp;rsquo;s old core, now regenerated and increasingly sought after by people who want to walk rather than drive to buy their morning coffee. Cincinnati votes Democrat and is publicly committed to decarbonisation and sustainability as part of its progressive politics, but its urban fabric beyond its gentrified central neighbourhoods is a mess. The sheer scale of the climate challenge facing America becomes apparent rolling along the seemingly endless miles of concrete in its car-dependent suburbs, yet even here there are glimpses of alternative, climate-friendly ways of living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here I meet Tanner Yess, perhaps Cincinnati&amp;rsquo;s only long-distance cycle commuter and the energy behind a number of radical community climate projects. His family migrated to the US from Fiji and Yess is very much at home in Lower Price Hill, a multi-ethnic working-class neighbourhood squeezed between Cincinnati&amp;rsquo;s huge railyards and the river. Lower Price Hill is a laboratory for what climate intervention across urban America might look like and Yess seeks to serve those who have been left behind in America&amp;rsquo;s rush towards middle-class dormitory towns and double driveways. When we meet he has just finished installing a new roof on a local building, part of a range of interventions to help the poorer and predominantly non-white residents cope with the weather extremes headed their way in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Climate change is a multipronged issue, so we try to bring everything together,&amp;rdquo; he says as he sips a beer in the sun. &amp;ldquo;Climate change is the ultimate FU [Fuck You], from colonisation, from segregation, whether we&amp;rsquo;re talking about Fiji or Cincinnati.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be it the Pacific or urban America, climate change hits the poorest hardest. One of the most notable features of the IRA is that alongside green technology and business subsidies, it channels finance directly to minority and vulnerable communities. America&amp;rsquo;s poorest currently struggle to afford energy and fuel, and housing is often substandard, so measures like insulation, community transport and solar panels are top of the list for the most underserved groups. Fundamentally the IRA funds projects that tackle everyday needs rather than trying to persuade people of the dangers of climate change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This isn&amp;rsquo;t about dying polar bears &amp;ndash; we need to meet people where they&amp;rsquo;re at,&amp;rdquo; says Yess pointedly. &amp;ldquo;Nobody here knows anything about the Paris Agreement or Biden&amp;rsquo;s stimulus, but they know their basement floods and that their air quality is bad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vested interests&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Cincinnati I cross into Indiana and head up towards Chicago, counting down the miles as the hills of the eastern US give way to the endless farms and open plains of the Midwest. Halfway across Indiana the freeway suddenly emerges into one of the biggest windfields east of the Mississippi, with new turbines stretching off into the distance on either side. The cheap energy that Americans have become used to is more likely to come from these huge turbine installations than from Appalachian coal in the future, and the plains are rapidly swapping grain silos for wind parks as farmers take advantage of generous tax breaks and land rents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually I roll into the small city of Evanston, just north of Chicago, on the shore of Lake Michigan. I am here for the last stop on my trip: a visit to the Institute for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern University, one of America&amp;rsquo;s leading interdisciplinary climate hubs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As a climate scientist we often like to say that our work is policy relevant but not policy prescriptive. We like to put our information out there and let policymakers run with it and make their own decisions,&amp;ldquo; says Daniel Horton, a climatologist at the institute, diplomatically. &amp;ldquo;The passage of the IRA was a big deal,&amp;rdquo; he admits though. &amp;ldquo;In the parlance of Biden and Obama it was a BFD [Big Fucking Deal], and that legislation has really put us on the right trajectory to start to decarbonise our economy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the approval of the IRA into law, climate and environmental justice experts who had fought an uphill struggle under the Trump presidency suddenly found themselves being listened to, and provided with the money to put their ideas into action quickly. The reluctance to intervene directly in climate policy is partly due to the fact that people like Horton are the epitome of the supposed &amp;ldquo;liberal elite&amp;rdquo;, the bogeyman of the Republican party and an increasingly unhinged conservative base. In reality, opposition to the IRA and climate action is underpinned by a fear that America might begin to shift away from a system that serves the rich and powerful at the expense of both people and planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Solving climate change requires systematic change, and the IRA represents a really positive big step in that direction,&amp;rdquo; Horton says optimistically, before pausing to qualify what he has just said. &amp;ldquo;Whether we can get to 1.5C change [as a limit], though, is an open-ended question.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I head for the airport along the dual carriageways lined with drive-thrus and strip malls sparkling in the spring twilight, I think again about Horton&amp;rsquo;s realist approach. America may now be broadly headed in the right direction, but there are still countless fights to come. Its green revolution will likely be less about building utopias than about coercion, adaptation and giving people a reason to leave old loyalties behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
