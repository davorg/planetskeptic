Mike Lee reacts with disbelief and shock that President Biden said some Republicans propose sunsetting Social Security and Medicare. Pure disbelief. Where could Biden get this obviously false crazy idea? Note that he did this while sitting next to Sen. Rick Scott, the guy who actually formally wrote the proposal as the Senate GOP platform position.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh. Funny how Lee used the promise of destroying social security while campaigning for the senate, and Rick Scott published a brochure explaining that he would do it. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/08/biden-wisconsin-speech-state-of-the-union-hecklers/">They’re on the record</a> and are now lying about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>After Lee was shown on TV expressing outrage over Biden saying that some Republicans wanted to cut those entitlements, critics online shared a video of an event from Lee’s Senate campaign. In the video originally posted to YouTube, Lee told a group of voters in Cache Valley, Utah, on Feb. 23, 2010, that he was about to “tell you one thing you probably have never heard from a politician.”</p>
<p>“It will be my objective to phase out Social Security, to pull it up from the roots and get rid of it,” Lee said at the time. “People who advise me politically always tell me it’s dangerous and I tell them, ‘In that case it’s not worth my running.’ That’s why I’m doing this, to get rid of that. Medicare and Medicaid are of the same sort. They need to be pulled up.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ron Desantis and Nikki Hailey have also endorsed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/09/trump-desantis-biden-social-security-medicare/">cutting social security and raising the retirement age</a>. I’m rather horrified at that, being 65 years old, and considering a delayed retirement already, at 67 or 68. Also, I registered for social security when I was 13 years old, and noticed then that a significant chunk of my $1.65/hour pay was snatched away by the gubmint. I figured it was OK, since it would contribute to my unimaginably distant retirement (now pretty easily imagined), but it means I’ve been paying in for 52 years. You don’t get to cut MY money, guys.</p>
<p>I hope the Democrats can get fired up and campaign hard on this issue.</p>
<p>Also, could everyone shut up about the stupid balloon? Yeah, China spies on us, we spy on them, everyone is spying on everyone.</p>

    <title>Jesus Haploid Christ</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/02/09/jesus-haploid-christ/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Do I need to cover this in my genetics course? Years ago, Ron Wyatt, the infamous pseudoarchaeologist, claimed to have made a remarkable discovery: he found the site of Jesus&amp;#8217; crucifixion! There was a hole, where the cross had been erected, and beneath that was a small chamber, and in that chamber was the Ark of the Covenant! Furthermore, Jesus&amp;#8217; blood had dripped down through the hole, and had splattered on the Ark, allowing him to collect a dried blood sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t believe it? It&amp;#8217;s on video, sort of. There&amp;#8217;s a hole in the ground, and Wyatt squats in it and says there&amp;#8217;s a chamber 60 feet down, and a door, and the Ark had been stuffed in there and packed in animal hides and boards and rocks. He doesn&amp;#8217;t actually show that, but would he lie to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkXwNHOhuVg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Wyatt found this site by a combination of &lt;a href="https://wyattmuseum.com/the-ark-of-the-covenant-special-article/2011-338"&gt;reading the Bible really hard, and by having visions&lt;/a&gt;, so it must be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day in Jerusalem, after the swelling in Ron’s legs and feet went down a bit, he decided to go sightseeing in the immediate area around his hotel near the Damascus Gate. Walking along an ancient stone quarry, known to some as “the Calvary Escarpment,” he began conversing with a local authority about Roman antiquities. At one point, they stopped walking, and Ron’s left hand pointed to a site being used as a trash dump and he stated, “That’s Jeremiah’s Grotto and the Ark of the Covenant is in there.” Even though these words had come from his own mouth and his own hand had pointed, he had not consciously done or said these things. In fact, it was the first time he had ever thought about excavating for the Ark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very special trash heap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he spent years digging down into the trash heap, and finally found something deep in a crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With adrenalin flowing through his veins and great anticipation, he looked around to see what else he could see, which wasn’t much. He shined his flashlight around the open area and then up to the ceiling. There, he saw something that caught his eye – it was a crack in the ceiling with a black substance within the crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crawling slowly and painfully over the rocks to the rear of the chamber, he saw a stone case extending through the rocks. It had a flat stone top which was cracked completely in two and the smaller section was moved aside, creating an opening into the stone case. But the top was too near the ceiling for him to look inside. Yet he knew what was inside – the crack in the ceiling was directly above the cracked part of the lid, where it was open, and the black substance had fallen from the crack into the case because some of it had splashed onto the lid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this time, as Ron recalls, as the instant realization of what had happened here dawned on him, that he passed out. When he realized that the crack in the ceiling was the end of the crack he had found in the elevated cross-hole many feet above him, and the black substance was blood which had fallen through the crack and into the stone case, he KNEW the Ark was in the stone case. But the most overwhelming realization was that Christ’s Blood had actually fallen onto the Mercy Seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he says it was Christ&amp;#8217;s blood, I guess that must be what it is. Who can argue with such meticulous logic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the fun part for a biologist. He collected a sample of the black goop, and rehydrated it. It was blood! Red blood cells, white blood cells, the works, and it was &lt;em&gt;still alive&lt;/em&gt;. He says he was able to culture the cells, squash some white blood cells, and examine their chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I have qualms. If Jesus&amp;#8217; blood was immortal, and could survive 2000 years of dessication and bacterial invasion, how could he squash a cell? And if he did, did the chromosomes and cellular debris on the slide continue to live? Are these tissues still living and growing in a slide box somewhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a prompt for a horror story somewhere, but right now we&amp;#8217;re talking about SCiEnCE, so let&amp;#8217;s get back to that karyotype. We have discovered &lt;a href="https://anchorstone.com/chromosomes-somatids-and-the-blood-of-christ/"&gt;how many chromosomes Jesus had&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances all human beings have 46 chromosomes…. 23 from their mother and 23 from their father. There are 22 pairs of autosomes which determine things such as our height, hair and eye color, etc. The 23rd pair is the sex determinant pair. They consist of either “X” or “Y” chromosomes. The mother only has “X” chromosomes. The father has both “X” and “Y” chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the sex-determinant pair is matched “X-X”, the child is a female. If “X-Y”, the child is a male. Thus we see that the single chromosome provided by the father in this chromosome pair determines the gender of the child. When the blood sample Ron Wyatt took from the crack in the rock ceiling above the Mercy Seat was tested, it contained 24 chromosomes…. 23 from the mother and one “Y” chromosome from the father, 24 chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Eugene Dunkley states in his article on the genetics of the blood of Christ, 24 chromosomes is exactly what would be expected if a man was born of a virgin. There are 23 chromosomes from the mother and a “Y” chromosome from a father. But that father cannot be a human father because the other 22 chromosomes on the father’s side are missing. Therefore the existence of a “Y” chromosome is at the very least a mystery, if not a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was Jesus haploid, he was aneuploid! I&amp;#8217;m glad that mystery has been cleared up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we don&amp;#8217;t have any photographs of the karyogram, no samples available, and you can&amp;#8217;t get a piece of Jesus&amp;#8217; immortalized haploid cell line, which would be interesting for biological research, and would probably be worse than HeLa at taking over cell cultures. All we have is &amp;#8220;Ron Wyatt said so.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also, possibly relevant to my genetics course: that last link talks about &lt;q&gt;somatids&lt;/q&gt;, which are immortal blobs found in &lt;em&gt;everyone&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; cells, which can only be seen using a special microscope called a somatoscope, invented by a guy named Gaston Naessens. I tried following &lt;a href="https://yummy.doctor/video-list/the-somatid-cycle-gaston-naessens-discussing-his-somatoscope/"&gt;an explanation of what they are, how they work, and how they disprove the germ theory of disease&lt;/a&gt;, but the dense layers of bullshit and bogosity proved too much for me. Cut me a break, I&amp;#8217;d just read a bunch of Ron Wyatt nonsense, I was already saturated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll dig deeper into that trash heap, but at least I&amp;#8217;ve concluded it&amp;#8217;s not suitable for any science class.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Another blessed event: YouTube has <em>banned</em> Kent Hovind! His KentHovindOfficial channel has been shut down, all of his videos erased. Hallelujah! To add insult to injury, he briefly appeared to complain about his deletion, and then urged everyone to go to his second channel, Dinosaur Adventure Land…then that was wiped out and deleted! Ah, such sweet schadenfreude.</p>
<p>There is still work to be done. Matt Powell, his mini-me, still has his MattPowellOfficial channel, which he can use to trumpet hate. Amusingly, Powell just recently left Dinosaur Adventure Land to return to his ‘ministry’ in Michigan. Hovind had a little farewell party in which he suggested Powell could return in a few years to take over DAL, clearly offering to make him his heir…and in the video, Powell flatly said no. Poor Kent. Abandoned. Denied. In public.</p>

<p>But what if I don’t want to read long blog posts on a micro-blogging site? What if I’d rather not deal with long-winded assholes clogging up the feed? I guess I don’t have a choice, except, of course, that I’ll instantly block anyone who posts a treatise.</p>
<p>Worse still, though, I just got this message:</p>

<p>Oh no! I must have been chattering up a storm today. Got carried away. I just couldn’t shut up. Supposedly, the <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-limits">limit is 2400 tweets/day</a>. But I’ve been tied up in lab and classes all day! How could I have done that?</p>
<p>So I looked to see how much ol’ blabbermouth PZ had babbled today.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>It was 6 tweets, and that broke Twitter’s capacity.</p>
<p>OK, that’s fine, I can switch to <a href="https://octodon.social/@pzmyers">my Mastodon account</a> and go crazy. Maybe I’ll post 8 times today. 10 times if I feel like flooring the accelerator.</p>

<p class="lead">I went through high school thinking that evolution was pretty neat. I read all the popular treatments — those Time/Life books, National Geographic, science magazines, etc. — and they made it sound like Darwin had got everything right in 1859. I could go along with that.</p>
<p>But then, in 1975, I went off to college and had access to a university library and started reading the real hardcore stuff. I was just mainlining PNAS &amp; Science &amp; Nature &amp; Evolution &amp; the Journal of Embryology and Experimental Morphology and soaking in all this exciting stuff, and that’s when I discovered the concept of genetic drift (specifically, thanks to Lewontin). My mind was blown. Suddenly, questions I had never even thought to ask were answered with clarity. Certainly nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution, but likewise nothing in evolution makes sense except in the light of neutral genetic drift.</p>
<p>I guess <a href="https://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/2021/07/lets-get-genetic-drift-in-k-12.html">Holly Dunsworth had the same revelation</a>, and also noticed the sad gap in public education.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the USA, K-12 evolution education standards are missing GENETIC DRIFT as well as the word NEUTRAL.</p>
<p>(see here: <a href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/topic-arrangement/hsnatural-selection-and-evolution">https://www.nextgenscience.org/topic-arrangement/hsnatural-selection-and-evolution</a>)</p>
<p>I don’t know how to understand life’s perpetual change without those fundamentals.</p>
<p>If students know about meiosis (which *is* in the standards), then they know about genetic drift. It’s just a matter of linking meiosis to evolution. </p>
<p>Genetic drift is a very simple concept and makes natural selection make a whole lot more sense!</p>
<p>I shout about this on Twitter and I get “just be happy anyone teaches evolution in K-12 at all” and “teachers don’t know about drift” in response. But evolution without genetic drift is not evolution, and if teachers knew about drift, then they’d be more comfortable teaching evolution. I guarantee it! </p>
<p>Without drift, it’s too easy to just replace God with natural selection. And that habit of narrating evolution by giving agency to natural selection is super-duper weird for non-believers let alone for believers! (This a no hatred of religion, faith, or creationism zone.)</p>
<p>Genetic drift paves the way for thinking about and then narrating evolution as the constant change that life/nature/biology is. Everyone gets that time is just constant change and they will get that  nature/biology/life is too. They embody it themselves, being different from their parents. </p>
<p>Plus, continuing to teach evolution as only being natural selection (which is what the standards are doing), is also dangerous. That selection-obsessed mindset is tied to racism, sexism, essentialism… all the stuff that we have to remove from our species’ shared origin story. Darwin only had selection (not drift, etc) to work with and look what his imagination did with evolution: racism, sexism, essentialism</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh wow, yes. I’ve got to stand up and cheer at that. Also specifically the bit about meiosis, because I’m teaching genetics right now and am constantly emphasizing the role of chance in inheritance. We’re built on a platform of coin flips and die rolls and long shots in heredity, yet somehow in our public education, that all vanishes and is replaced with something close to fixed destiny (in higher ed, that isn’t true, fortunately. Usually.)</p>
<p>Also, drift nicely bridges all those gaps in comprehension the creationists love to inflict on us.</p>

    <title>Fighting for the rights of future generations</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6073/fighting-for-the-rights-of-future-generations#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2AJN2YR.jpg" height="664" alt="Fighting for the rights of future generations" width="1000"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Two years ago, 16-year-old Anjali Sharma took the brave step of suing Australian environment minister Sussan Ley. Alongside seven other teenagers and an 87-year-old nun, she argued in court that the country owed a duty of care to its young people, and that, based on this, it should reject the planned expansion of a coal mine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In 2021, a judge supported her claim, saying Ley was responsible for avoiding personal injury or death to all Australians under the age of 18 &amp;ldquo;arising from emissions of carbon dioxide into the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere&amp;rdquo;. It was upheld as a landmark legal ruling and was celebrated by young climate campaigners across the world. But the celebration didn&amp;rsquo;t last long: the Federal Court of Australia overturned the decision on appeal in 2022. The three judges agreed that the threat of climate change was real, but concluded that no specific duty was owed to the young people. (Each judge had different reasons for reaching this conclusion.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Sharma was devastated but remains convinced that such a duty is a moral imperative that cannot be denied. She continues to urge politicians to listen to the voices of young people &amp;ldquo;who are begging for more comprehensive action on climate change&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;This is not an outlandish position to take: over the past century, intergenerational rights have been asserted numerous times in prominent international agreements. In the 1945 Charter of the United Nations saving &amp;ldquo;succeeding generations from the scourge of war&amp;rdquo; was identified as one of the new body&amp;rsquo;s main purposes, while the 1972 Stockholm Declaration introduced the notion of a general environmental duty to people in the future. In 1992, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change called on parties to &amp;ldquo;protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity&amp;rdquo;. And 23 years later, the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change emphasised the responsibilities of states to consider intergenerational equity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The idea that we might explicitly recognise the rights of future generations is, therefore, not at all far-fetched. Legal standing was once the preserve of rich white men, but it has been gradually extended to include all humans &amp;ndash; and even corporations. The rights of nature are increasingly being recognised in law, in countries from Ecuador to New Zealand, as well as communities across the US. Advocates say that protecting the rights of ecosystems such as rivers and forests can help foster the deeper kind of systemic thinking needed to support humanity in the long-term, and also directly supports future generations by helping ensure they have a functioning world to live in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But time is running out. As the impacts of climate change and other environmental disasters become increasingly tangible, human rights bodies are stressing the importance of taking action now to ensure the continued existence and flourishing of humankind. It is today&amp;rsquo;s young people whose lives and well-being are at stake. In 2019, the UN Human Rights Committee said environmental degradation, climate change and unsustainable development &amp;ldquo;constitute some of the most pressing and serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life&amp;rdquo;. A 2018 report by the London-based Intergenerational Foundation concluded that the oil and gas industry was &amp;ldquo;rigging the future against the young&amp;rdquo; by shirking the enormous costs of decommissioning its activities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;Persuading the courts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Yet for all these warnings, future-focused action on climate has been lacking. This has led young people around the world to take matters into their own hands. Like Sharma, they argue that the wide-ranging and devastating global impacts of rising greenhouse emissions will have a disproportionate effect on the lives and wellbeing of younger generations, in many cases infringing their basic human rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Greta Thunberg&amp;rsquo;s solo protests outside the Swedish parliament famously inspired a worldwide movement called Fridays for Future, and gave her the clout to directly admonish world leaders for their inaction in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Such high-profile actions have been credited with shifting the narrative on climate change around the world; a 2021 study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; showed that Americans who reported being more familiar with Thunberg also felt more confident that they could help mitigate climate change as part of a collective effort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;One young woman from Fridays for Future, Luisa Neubauer, went on to sue the German government. The judge ruled that existing legislation placed an unfair burden on younger people. The decision forced the state to swiftly amend its climate laws last year, tightening its targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions and setting out more clearly how it was going to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It is not the only court to have reached such a conclusion. In 2018, the Colombian Supreme Court ruled in favour of 25 children and young people who said the state was failing to protect their rights to life and a healthy environment. The court found that deforestation in the Amazon causes serious damage to all Colombians of present and future generations and that the protection of fundamental rights extends to the unborn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;These are just a few examples from the burgeoning field of climate litigation, in which people across the world are taking governments and countries to court in a bid to force them into action on climate change. In South Korea, a 20-week-old foetus recently become the youngest ever claimant in such a case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Of course, such young claimants can&amp;rsquo;t act on their own. The non-profit law firm Our Children&amp;rsquo;s Trust is one of the bodies supporting children and young people to take the lead. It has coordinated and supported dozens of climate-related lawsuits across the US since 2011, testing legal ground and attempting to shift public policy and opinion. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s vital that young people are the ones leading these cases and have the agency to make these decisions about their representation and what they want for themselves in their lives,&amp;rdquo; says Our Children&amp;rsquo;s Trust founder Julia Olson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Their most high-profile case, first filed in 2015 by then 19-year-old Kelsey Juliana, alongside 20 other young people, uses the long-established &amp;ldquo;public trust&amp;rdquo; doctrine to argue that the atmosphere is a public resource that the government is responsible for looking after for the benefit of the people &amp;ndash; and that acting in a way that exacerbates climate change is therefore a breach of their constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The young people and their lawyers have since been navigating the labyrinth of the US judicial system. Settlement talks with the US Department of Justice fell apart last year and they are now waiting to hear if an amended version of their claim can go to trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;How to be a good ancestor&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;But while the young are increasingly advocating for themselves in our legal systems, there is more work to be done to change attitudes in society. Roman Krznaric, philosopher and best-selling writer, is one of the key voices today bent on spreading the message that we all have a profound moral responsibility to leave the world in good shape for future generations. He began to write 2020&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Good Ancestor: How to Think Long-term in a Short-term World&lt;/em&gt; after experiencing a mounting sense of frustration. &amp;ldquo;Never in history have our actions had such potentially damaging impacts on the generations to come,&amp;rdquo; he tells me. &amp;ldquo;But in wealthy countries, especially, we&amp;rsquo;ve colonised the future. We treat [it] like a distant colonial outpost where we can freely dump ecological degradation and technological risks as if nobody was there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;He notes that nearly every world religion and form of spiritual thought has a version of the &amp;ldquo;Golden Rule&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; do unto others as you&amp;rsquo;d have them do unto you &amp;ndash; which can easily be extended to encompass the future. He recognises neurological tussles in the human brain between the desire for instant gratification and the ability to plan and prepare for the long haul, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe that short-term thinking can simply be blamed on human nature. &amp;ldquo;[The latter is] why we save for our pensions or write songlists for our own funerals. That&amp;rsquo;s how we built the Great Wall of China and voyaged into space; our minds can dance across time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Ancestor&lt;/em&gt; explores ways in which political, economic and social institutions could be designed to nurture and amplify our longer-term thinking. It cites the growing global network of over 4,800 businesses which have adopted social and environmental performance goals as well as financial ones, earning them certification as &amp;ldquo;B Corps&amp;rdquo;, as an example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Economists have been selling us the narrative of the individual self-interested human for at least 100 years,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s now a counter narrative to that . . . and I think those new narratives make a difference because when we see ourselves as more cooperative creatures we start designing institutions that way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Writer Ella Saltmarshe believes public imagination and collective action can help us all be good ancestors. In 2018, she founded the Long Time Project with Beatrice Pembroke, now executive director of culture at King&amp;rsquo;s College London, to help individuals and organisations broaden how they think about the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The project has developed a toolkit to help organisations map the operational and cultural areas where they can embed &amp;ldquo;long time&amp;rdquo; principles and measure their success. Local and national authorities around the world have been testing out its practical ideas, including an empty chair used to symbolically represent future generations in meetings. New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s Environmental Protection Authority used another exercise, during induction days for new staff, called &amp;ldquo;Human Layers&amp;rdquo;, where participants move forwards and backwards in the room, while reflecting on people&amp;rsquo;s lives in the past and future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Economist Tatsuyoshi Saijo has been advocating for such an approach for the past decade as part of his Future Design movement. This encourages Japanese policymakers to put themselves into the shoes (or in this case, the symbolic ceremonial robes) of citizens from 2060. As it turns out, people representing the future systematically advocated for far more transformative plans for their towns and cities &amp;ndash; whether on climate, automation, the problems of an ageing society or long-term investment in health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In some countries, this kind of long-term thinking is starting to be built into legislation. Sophie Howe has held the role of future generations commissioner for Wales since it was conceived in 2015 under the nation&amp;rsquo;s novel Wellbeing of Future Generations Act. She describes her job as being &amp;ldquo;the conscience&amp;rdquo; on behalf of people who will live in Wales in the future. Her first success involved the scrapping of a planned 14-mile motorway. She argued that it would conflict with Wales&amp;rsquo; low-carbon goals, equality provisions and biodiversity plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Since then, Howe has advocated for wider changes to Welsh transport policy, the formal declaration of a climate emergency and substantial rises in environmental spending. She suspects that when members of the Welsh parliament passed the law in 2015 &amp;ldquo;they didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what they were getting themselves into&amp;rdquo; but says there have since been some &amp;ldquo;massive shifts&amp;rdquo; in policy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Wales is not the only country taking this approach. There is a Committee for the Future in the Finnish Parliament, while Hungary has a future generations ombudsman. But determining the needs of the unborn isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy. As a reference point, Howe uses the results of a national exercise across Wales which asked thousands of people what kind of country they would like to leave for their children and grandchildren, resulting in 13 different priorities from the right skills for their future to good quality housing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;However, she recognises that a shift in culture and mindset is also essential to make meaningful change. &amp;ldquo;Some of the big elements in my work have been in building a movement, inspiring people and communicating on the [Wellbeing of Future Generations] Act. Just sort of describing what Wales could look like if you&amp;rsquo;ve got this right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Intergenerational action&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Many of the adults who are committed to promoting long-term thinking credit their relationships with the young people in their lives. Saltmarshe sees the aim of the Long Time Project as expanding people&amp;rsquo;s sense of kinship. &amp;ldquo;We start with the emotions people feel about the people they care about and then try to grow those to a more collective concern.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Her eureka moment came when she rushed to stop her two-year-old nephew from pulling a wardrobe down on himself, while she was reading about the horrors of climate change. &amp;ldquo;He cried at the injustice of being taken away from the best game in the universe. And, I guess to his surprise, I started to cry too, because in that moment I suddenly realised that the future I&amp;rsquo;d been reading about was the future he&amp;rsquo;d likely be alive in. And I was not going to be around to scoop him up from danger.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Krznaric, the philosopher, has talked movingly about his 13-year-old twins. &amp;ldquo;You know, my children could easily be alive in the year 2100 &amp;ndash; and that future isn&amp;rsquo;t science fiction.&amp;rdquo; But what about people without children? Do they have the same vested interest in the future? There is a growing movement of people choosing not to procreate; a popular forum on social media site Reddit, called &amp;ldquo;r/childfree&amp;rdquo;, has more than a million users. People have different reasons for choosing not to have children, but the environmental impact of reproducing &amp;ndash; and an uncertain climate future &amp;ndash; is certainly a live topic of discussion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;For many, the reason they don&amp;rsquo;t want children is because they know about the impacts that we&amp;rsquo;re having on the planet,&amp;rdquo; says Krznaric. &amp;ldquo;Our mortality is one of our greatest hopes for looking towards the future because most human beings, when they reach middle age, start thinking about their legacy when they die. But I think what being a good ancestor is about is about going beyond that; it&amp;rsquo;s about caring about the universal strangers of the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;There are some causes for hope. In Australia &amp;ndash; a nation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions from coal power per capita &amp;ndash; the Labor party won resoundingly this year on the platform of a &amp;ldquo;better future&amp;rdquo; in what was dubbed a &amp;ldquo;climate election&amp;rdquo;. Their new prime minister Anthony Albanese has promised meaningful action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But the country&amp;rsquo;s younger residents know better than to trust in promises. Anjali Sharma has already raised concerns about the government&amp;rsquo;s approval of new gas projects, asking citizens not to &amp;ldquo;settle for mediocre&amp;rdquo;. Will Australia, and the rest of the world, make the shift from short-termism to the sort of approach that values and protects future generations? Such meaningful change has yet to be seen. And the clock is ticking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>

    <title>Book review: Haramacy</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/9781800181328-uk.jpeg" height="431" alt="Haramacy book" width="281"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haramacy (Unbound),&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; edited by Zahed Sultan, Dhruva Balram and Tara Joshi &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s my second day back in London after living away for more than seven years. I board the Overground train at Whitechapel to hear a stream of invective from the end of an otherwise silent carriage. A middle-aged man is levelling every known obscenity at the young man sitting opposite him. &amp;ldquo;Talk English!&amp;rdquo; he shouts. &amp;ldquo;Look at you &amp;ndash; none of you talk English! What the hell are you doing in this country? Get the **** out of here.&amp;rdquo; No one intervenes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;It is into this Britain, with its perennial hues of nationalist racism, that &lt;em&gt;Haramacy&lt;/em&gt; makes an intervention. Conceived in 2020 and authored during the pandemic, the book is an edited anthology of non-fiction writings by mostly Britain-based authors from the Middle East and South Asia and their diasporas. Its essays explore matters from music, love and sexuality to health, violence and capitalism, all interwoven with the overarching themes of ethnicity, heritage and home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;The title is a play on the Arabic word &lt;em&gt;haram&lt;/em&gt;, meaning forbidden or indecent, and the English &amp;ldquo;pharmacy&amp;rdquo;. As such, it provides a tonic for the many assumptions, omissions and reductions that define contemporary discussions about race and society in the UK. As its editors Dhruva Balram and Tara Joshi observe of the dynamics of media and publishing, &amp;ldquo;we are largely asked to speak on our cultures and our ethnicity only when they are trending . . . We have often been frustrated in not being able to deliver the necessary stories we wanted to read about ourselves, our communities and our friends.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;The disparate, multi-generational voices of &lt;em&gt;Haramacy &lt;/em&gt;come as a riposte to the homogenising categories to which mainstream society has reduced diasporic identities. As Balram notes in an essay on his upbringing in Toronto, citing the Mauritian-Canadian writer Naben Ruthnum, &amp;ldquo;what people in the South Asian diaspora in the West share is that people looking at them assume that we all come from a similar place and past.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Against these assumptions, the authors of &lt;em&gt;Haramacy&lt;/em&gt; establish a dialogue amongst themselves as much as with the dominant culture &amp;ndash; a discourse highlighting the many internal faultlines, conflicts and contradictions of identity and community. For example, Cyrine Sinti&amp;rsquo;s essay &amp;ldquo;The &lt;br&gt;Illegitimate Indian&amp;rdquo; is a sober account of her mixed gypsy heritage, and its role in shaping her often violent relations to British, European and Indian society. As she writes, &amp;ldquo;Midnight moon rituals, sex work and ethnic defiance to my left, white-supremacy, bare-knuckle fighting and fascist contempt to my right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;While the voices in &lt;em&gt;Haramacy&lt;/em&gt; deep-dive into questions of heritage, it is far from a work of mere introspection. Rather, its contents are deeply political and necessary meditations on currents of historical and structural racism as they shape all facets of individual lives. Notably, a number of essays decry how certain members of society have been viewed, not as people, but in terms of their productive capacities &amp;ndash; as was made particularly stark during the pandemic. Among them, Sanjana Varghese writes in an essay on the lockdown in London, &amp;ldquo;I am tired of couching the value of people&amp;rsquo;s lives in productivity, like these people didn&amp;rsquo;t matter before they were disinfecting hospital surfaces or taking people&amp;rsquo;s garbage away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Similarly, Kieran Yates examines how the iniquitous dictates of labour in their most extreme form corrode the health of specific communities through sleep-deprivation, stress and exploitation. In this way, individual experiences of burn-out become deeply linked to struggles for equality. As she writes, &amp;ldquo;There is power in the politics of rest . . . in practical terms it fortifies us to be able to fight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haramacy&lt;/em&gt; is as much a call for collective mobilisation as it is a vivid account of individual identities. Storytelling becomes yet another tool to counter the narratives of power. As Saleem Haddad explains, &amp;ldquo;The point was never to write to change the world. At best, once could write to open up the world somehow . . . To write through all the powerful narratives that strive to bury your voice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Punctuation is powerful!!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6070/punctuation-is-powerful#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2EMX71K.jpg" height="1000" alt="Protest march" width="1500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;After the storming of the Washington Capitol on 6 January 2021, Donald Trump revelled in the violent mayhem. Two days later, he tweeted that his supporters &amp;ldquo;will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!&amp;rdquo; Soon after, Twitter bowed to the pressure and banned its most famous user. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how the triple exclamation marks at the end of that tweet could have added more fuel to the fire. Trump inundated his Tweets with !, !!, !!!, and even !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (that&amp;rsquo;s 15 characters &amp;ndash; someone was very angry that a foreign film won the best movie category at the Oscars in 2014). Such compulsion to ! did not go unnoticed: the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; observed that Trump&amp;rsquo;s messages looked like &amp;ldquo;someone on the verge of a hysterical breakdown or a profound religious awakening&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;! shakes us awake. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do. In a 2011 study, Utrecht social psychology professor Kees van den Bos did an fMRI scan on participants, examining which brain areas activate upon seeing an exclamation mark flash on a screen. Neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex fire up, responsible for judgment and alertness. It&amp;rsquo;s not panic yet, but the stage before, when we decide whether what we&amp;rsquo;re confronted with is unsettling enough to expend more attention and energy. The results of the cognitive study were confirmed in surveys that had the same participants assess moral issues. They played a game with an opponent (in reality a computer) who would withhold rewards from them after the game. When seeing a ! before judging their opponent&amp;rsquo;s actions, participants found the mismatch of give-and-take to be &amp;ldquo;very unfair&amp;rdquo; rather than just &amp;ldquo;unfair&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Banning Trump made Twitter noticeably quieter. While he was reinstated in 2022 he has since declined to tweet, and we are yet to see if he takes the same approach with Facebook, after Meta's recent announcement that they intend to lift their ban. But the damage may already be done, and not only by the former President of the United States. Today, exclamation marks play an integral part in how we navigate Twitter. In the wake of the pandemic, and following misinformation about the 2020 US election being &amp;ldquo;stolen&amp;rdquo;, the platform installed a fact-check alert by adding a small blue exclamation mark in a circle at the bottom of potentially (or probably) misleading posts. The exclamation mark flags up that there&amp;rsquo;s something untoward going on. Beware!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;But perhaps this recent usage unfairly maligns the exclamation mark, which has a long history that tells us something about the evolution of language itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;thehistoryofpunctuation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Punctuation addresses the need to comprehend the text &amp;ndash; both the sense of the words, as well as their emotional meaning. In classical times, writing was not a separate manifestation of language, but a mere record of speech. And since we don&amp;rsquo;t pause much between words when speaking (we do, just imperceptibly so), wordshadnospacesbetweenthemlikesomakingreadinghardandslow. An educated reader would have been able to figure out where one word ends and another starts, but learners would have had trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Aristophanes, the head librarian of the venerable library of Alexandria in Greek-influenced Egypt, noticed that non-native Greek readers had problems navigating elaborate literary sentences. He pioneered punctuation by adding a dot at different levels of the line, flagging up the grammatical structure of a sentence and three kinds of pauses (long, medial and short).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It took hundreds of years, however, and the right kinds of choices by people in power (mainly popes and kings), to establish punctuation in the west. Gaelic-speaking scribes in ninth-century Ireland who copied out church texts in Latin slipped blanks between words, making it easier to understand the text, revolutionising reading and writing in the process. With the rise of more kingdoms, city states and global trade during the later Middle Ages and early Renaissance, written communication moved out of the monastery and into the offices of merchants and messengers of states. Writing became worldly. It needed to offer quick and easy retrieval of the content of words, while also manoeuvring increasingly nuanced meanings that punctuation helped decode.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The question mark arrived sometime between the eighth and 13th century (depending on which shape one accepts as ?). It was the first sign to give guidance on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to read, rather than &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;. We don&amp;rsquo;t have to scan the context or spot interrogative words to know we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a question.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long after this that the exclamation mark entered the scene. In the mid-14th century, Iacopo Alpoleio, a scholar from the small Italian town of Urbisaglia, composed a treatise on &amp;ldquo;The Art of Punctuation&amp;rdquo; and put a new mark forward: &amp;ldquo;seeing that the exclamatory or admirative sentences were pronounced in the same way as continuing or interrogative discourse, I acquired the habit of pointing the end of such sentences by means of a clear point, and a comma placed to the side above that same point.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s a bit like a full stop and an apostrophe earring, dangling from the top of the line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Half a century later, in 1399, another Italian academic realised the form Alpoleio only described. Adding hand-written notes to the text he dictated to his secretary, the lawyer Coluccio Salutati put a spirited slanting / over a full stop, becoming the first person to exclaim in words. Coluccio was such a punctuation fan that he also invented the first parentheses in the very same manuscript (but that&amp;rsquo;s another story). Soon after, Coluccio&amp;rsquo;s !-shape hits those early printshops of Venice and Basel that were experimenting with the new technology from 1450 of printing text with movable letters. The exclamation mark&amp;rsquo;s survival is guaranteed through its inclusion in print type. But survival doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean understanding or confident use. Originally, ! was supposed to signal &amp;ldquo;exclamation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;admiration&amp;rdquo; or wonder. What precisely does that mean, though? Would its use be only restricted to feelings suggesting something we&amp;rsquo;d call &amp;ldquo;wow!&amp;rdquo; today? Or could you also add a mark to all kinds of textual shouting like &amp;ldquo;hey!&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;good sir!&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;zounds!&amp;rdquo; (the Renaissance version of &amp;ldquo;fuck&amp;rdquo;)?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;From suspicion to saturation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;For a good 300 years after its first mention, neither readers, educators nor printers grasped quite what the exclamation mark was up to. In his 1611 English-French dictionary, Randal Cotgrave defined it as &amp;ldquo;the point of admiration (and detestation)&amp;rdquo;. The parenthesis testifies to the slippery nature of the mark, wriggling out of people&amp;rsquo;s reach and flying from marvel to disgust at the drop of a hat. And as if capitulating to the wayward ambiguity of the exclamation mark travelling up and down the spectrum of human emotion, 18th-century lexicographers like Dr Samuel Johnson allowed the sign to enlarge its sphere of influence to encompass any eruption of passion or &amp;ldquo;pathetical sentence&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It seemed as though ! had made its mark. But after a brief stint as the perfect punctuation mark to express the delicate promptings of the heart of a Rousseau or an Austen, the exclamation mark lived a low life as a misunderstood and mistrusted exaggeration of emotion. In the hugely influential 1906 grammar manual &lt;em&gt;The King&amp;rsquo;s English&lt;/em&gt;, the Fowler brothers sternly warn against that &amp;ldquo;excessive use of exclamation marks&amp;rdquo; which is &amp;ldquo;one of the things that betray the uneducated&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;War, however, makes no distinction between social classes: in propaganda posters of both sides in the Second World War, ! does double duty, both as attention-catcher and encouragement to stay alert. But its real natural home was perhaps yet to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s social media is inextricably intertwined with internet technologies and smart phones. While typewriters as late as the 1970s did not have an extra key for !, requiring a laborious back-and-forth dance of typing a dot, backspacing, and adding an apostrophe above it (much as Alpoleio proposed), we can now produce any amount of !!!!!!!!!!!! simply by holding down our thumbs on our devices, and at no added cost whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;New technology has made ! ubiquitous. At the same time, it has powerful competitors. If the single exclamation mark encapsulates varied emotions in a voiceless faceless text from anger to admiration, emojis express a greater hue of feelings and feeling-situations in a more detailed way. Different kinds of laughing eyes, with or without tears, transmit more nuanced messages about emotion. Our sentences become shorter, less in need of punctuation traffic signs to orchestrate what we mean. Can you remember the last time you used a semicolon? Do we even remember what it&amp;rsquo;s for? Are emojis and texts killing punctuation?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Yes. And no. While it&amp;rsquo;s true that emojis have become so detailed and varied that they can (just about) convey the plot of a Shakespeare play without the crutch of the Bard&amp;rsquo;s own lines, they&amp;rsquo;re actually not useful for swift recognition of emotion. We need to pause that bit longer and scrutinise the small pictures. How does the sender intend that fire emoji to work in this particular context? That&amp;rsquo;s the same work of interpretation that is needed with the exclamation mark, but we&amp;rsquo;re much less burdened with ! and its single remarkable form.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like ! will be going anywhere soon, even if its biggest orange-faced fan has lost his favourite platform. And while it can be used to provoke outrage and panic, ! also has a softer side, which seems to do the opposite: soothing tensions and bringing people together. A 2006 study by researcher Carol Waseleski has shown how exclamation marks convey friendliness in chat rooms, bridging the gap between anonymous online communication and friendly presence. Take that, worry-mongers of Twitter! There&amp;rsquo;s nothing inherently good or bad about the exclamation mark. ! is what you make of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Florence Hazrat's &amp;ldquo;An Admirable Point: A Brief History of the Exclamation Mark!&amp;rdquo; is published by Profile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Intelligence is everywhere</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6068/intelligence-is-everywhere#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanist-Octopus.jpg" height="798" alt="Octopus illustration" width="1000"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Octopuses are having a moment. So are slime moulds and honeybees. Mushrooms are in vogue. After 250 years of humanity (well, some of humanity&amp;hellip;) confidently atop the great pyramid of being, we in the west are becoming more aware that we might, perhaps, have company. The ingenuity and inventiveness of the natural world, its complexity and its collaboration, are becoming harder and harder to deny. Some people are even calling it intelligence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Over the last five years, a cluster of books has brought these ideas to public attention. In 2016, Peter Godfrey-Smith published &lt;em&gt;Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness&lt;/em&gt;, in which he argued that &amp;ldquo;evolution built minds twice over&amp;rdquo;, and octopuses&amp;rsquo; invertebrate intelligence may shed light on what it means for us to be conscious, too. In 2019, Richard Powers&amp;rsquo; novel &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt;, about eight people&amp;rsquo;s lives connected through their relationship with trees, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In 2020, word of mouth lifted Robin Wall Kimmerer&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Braiding Sweetgrass&lt;/em&gt;, published seven years previously, into the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller list, for the vision it presented of mutual care and connection between people and plants. That year, Merlin Sheldrake published &lt;em&gt;Entangled Life&lt;/em&gt;, another bestseller, exploring fungi and the &amp;ldquo;wood wide web&amp;rdquo; of their mycorrhizal collaboration with plants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;This year sees the arrival of two extraordinary books that weave these threads one step further: &lt;em&gt;Ways of Being: Beyond Human Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, by British artist, technologist and writer James Bridle, and &lt;em&gt;The Mountain in the Sea&lt;/em&gt;, the first novel from American Ray Nayler. One is fiction, the other non-fiction &amp;ndash; but they speak to the same themes: intelligence beyond the human, of not just plant and animal varieties, but artificial and technological as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ways of Being&lt;/em&gt; sets about &amp;ldquo;expanding our definition of intelligence, and the chorus of minds which manifest it.&amp;rdquo; Synthesising the work of ecologists and other scientists, Bridle (who uses they/them pronouns) seeks to explore the &amp;ldquo;multiple forms of being and doing, of living and thriving, structured across and interwoven between the many branches of the tree, or thicket, of life.&amp;rdquo; Ultimately, they argue for a &amp;ldquo;technological ecology&amp;rdquo; in which our recent creations might not distance us from nature, but instead help us better understand the collaboration and teeming complexity of the natural world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mountain in the Sea&lt;/em&gt; is also a story about the meeting of more-than-human minds, encompassing humans, other animals and human technology. In the novel, rumour spreads of an unusual pod of octopuses living on a shipwreck off the Con Dao islands in Vietnam. They&amp;rsquo;re collaborating, signalling &amp;ndash; perhaps even using (can it be?) language. Marine biologist Dr Ha Nguyen, who has spent her whole career researching cephalopod intelligence, is fascinated &amp;ndash; and so is transnational tech corporation DIANIMA, which has bought and sealed off the archipelago and parachuted Dr Nguyen in, alongside the world&amp;rsquo;s first android robot, to find out what is going on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Will the creatures offer unprecedented breakthroughs in artificial intelligence technology? Or do they just want to be left the hell alone? Nayler&amp;rsquo;s debut is equal parts page-turning near-future thriller and a profound exploration of language, communication and otherness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;"Nature" and "technology" are not in opposition&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Both books are exhilarating and kaleidoscopic. They draw on rich traditions of thought &amp;ndash; geography, anthropology, ecology and systems science in the west, alongside older rural and Indigenous traditions of observation and being-in-relation with a place&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t traditional nature writing in which &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo; is opposed to &amp;ldquo;technology&amp;rdquo;. Quite the opposite. For both authors, artificial intelligences are simply &amp;ldquo;other minds&amp;rdquo;, a new human-made branch on the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As Bridle writes, &amp;ldquo;We have already learned &amp;ndash; from the gibbons, gorillas and macaques &amp;ndash; that intelligence is relational: it matters how and where you do it, what form your body gives it, and with whom it connects.&amp;rdquo; In this spirit, I spoke to both writers to understand the genealogy of these books in personal, as well as intellectual terms. How did the authors open their minds to other minds, and more-than-human worlds?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;For Nayler, it seems that &lt;em&gt;The Mountain in the Sea &lt;/em&gt;was a lifetime in the making. &amp;ldquo;I wrote a report when I was maybe in fourth or fifth grade about octopuses,&amp;rdquo; he told me. &amp;ldquo;And then I had spent this time in Vietnam as the environment, science, technology and health officer at the consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, and especially on Con Dao, working on a few different projects.&amp;rdquo; Through his career in the United States Peace Corps and Foreign Service, Nayler lived and worked all over the world. But he found something exceptional in the remote Con Dao islands, off the southern coast of Vietnam. &amp;ldquo;I just grew to love that place, this very troubled environment: it&amp;rsquo;s a national park with a lot of issues with poaching, overfishing and other environmental degradation from the human population. And that place stuck with me as a place that I wanted to set a story.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Why octopuses specifically? &amp;ldquo;I wanted a first contact story that wasn&amp;rsquo;t with an alien, but with a species here on Earth. And that wasn&amp;rsquo;t about finding intelligent life &amp;ndash; which is such a misnomer, because I think that wildlife is incredibly intelligent in very different ways &amp;ndash; but that was about finding contact with an animal that had a symbolic level of communication, like we do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;While Nayler looks at human-animal communication through science fiction, Bridle draws on a diversity of scientific research. &amp;ldquo;Humans have spoken to and with animals for as long as we have walked alongside them, which is forever,&amp;rdquo; they write. One example relates to the Yao people of Mozambique, who forage for wild honey cooperatively with honeyguides &amp;ndash; small brown birds who make distinctive calls to get Yao people&amp;rsquo;s attention, while the Yao vocalise a tongue-rolling &amp;ldquo;brrrrr-hm&amp;rdquo; to call the birds in turn. The hunters triple their chances of finding a hive in the forest, while the birds benefit from the hunters&amp;rsquo; sharp axes cutting open the tough hives, releasing the nutritious beeswax inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not just hunter-gatherers making the effort: computer scientists are, too. &lt;em&gt;Ways of Being&lt;/em&gt; covers recent research from Google, MIT and the University of Arizona, such as the use of sensors and machine learning to classify patterns in whale song and prairie dog calls, in the hopes of figuring out the principles of their speech. Bridle values this attentiveness to other beings, but reminds us not to limit our aspirations: &amp;ldquo;Our goal should not be to master their languages, but rather to better understand animals&amp;rsquo; lives in context, and thereby to alter our relationships with them in ways which are mutually beneficial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Nayler&amp;rsquo;s fictional octopuses might agree. When they finally choose to speak directly to Dr Ha Nguyen, one creature presents itself to her, letting her see the pictograms flashing across its mantle and &amp;ldquo;pouring through the chromatophores of its skin&amp;rdquo;. Its message is an insistence on their mutual consciousness. When, later, the octopuses start making physical, writing-like signs, it is not in order to engage further with humanity, but to utter a clear and unexpected instruction: &amp;ldquo;Fuck off.&amp;rdquo; They wish to be left alone, their environment and emergent way of life undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Nayler&amp;rsquo;s interest in language &amp;ldquo;came out of my exploration of biosemiotics,&amp;rdquo; he tells me: Jesper Hoffmeyer&amp;rsquo;s books &lt;em&gt;Biosemiotics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Signs of Meaning in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; were particular inspirations. &amp;ldquo;If semiotics is the study of signs and sign systems, biosemiotics takes that and expands it to every single level of life,&amp;rdquo; Nayler explained. &amp;ldquo;Biosemiotics is the study of signs at the level of the cellular, all the way up to complex human symbolic communication.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s physical, of course,&amp;rdquo; Nayler continued, &amp;ldquo;all sign exchange is physical and occurs in the world,&amp;rdquo; from the electrical pulses that jolt through a nerve cell, to the pigment sacs that expand and contract in an octopus&amp;rsquo;s skin. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing metaphysical about it. But you can&amp;rsquo;t really explain life without attending to the exchange of signs and signals processing. &amp;lsquo;Even a cell can process meaning&amp;rsquo; is essentially the argument. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that a cell has a brain, but it means that a cell can take inputs and interpret that input and do something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an ontological shock: what if the capacity the human has for language, the thing we thought made us special, is not in fact unique to us, but actually something present across many different forms of life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;The singing world&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;"More-than-human doesn&amp;rsquo;t even begin to cover it,&amp;rdquo; Bridle writes in &lt;em&gt;Ways of Being&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Not only are we the products of multiple entangled ancestors, spanning vast ranges of the evolutionary field; we are not even individuals at all.&amp;rdquo; Chapter 3, &amp;ldquo;The Thicket of Life&amp;rdquo;, explores one search for the origins of life through unravelling the &amp;ldquo;internal fossil record&amp;rdquo; of DNA, RNA and proteins inside our cells. Cells not only signal to each other, Bridle explains, they&amp;rsquo;re deeply entangled &amp;ldquo;endosymbionts&amp;rdquo;. Deep in evolutionary history, scientists theorise, one bacterium engulfed another one and their hybridity became the cellular structures of mitochondria and chloroplasts, which produced the energy enabling complex, multi-cellular life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Bridle&amp;rsquo;s writing here is joyful, almost delirious: &amp;ldquo;Frseeeeeeeefronnnng and we all go tumbling down the genetic line together . . . The lichens farm algae and we farm bacteria and each feeds the other, the trees are talking and everyone&amp;rsquo;s singing.&amp;rdquo; I am not surprised to read that ayahuasca has been part of Bridle&amp;rsquo;s journey from London-based technologist to island-dwelling, regenerative-farming exploring, more-than-human thinker. &amp;ldquo;I have heard a plant speak, and I still don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand how, nor can I adequately describe the experience, but I know it to have happened, and it changed me utterly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;More-than-human thinking isn&amp;rsquo;t just about recognising the near-to-human cleverness of certain animals, but recognising agency and interdependent relations across every kingdom of life, from the single-celled extremophiles known as archaeans, to fungi, animals and plants. For both writers, forests have been particularly inspiring environments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Nayler said, &amp;ldquo;I had a short story a little while ago called &amp;lsquo;Eyes of the Forest&amp;rsquo;, and there&amp;rsquo;s a character in there that says, &amp;lsquo;It matters how you see the forest but what matters more is how the forest sees you.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; His years in the Peace Corps in Turkmenistan taught him that communication exists in the space between self and other: not only in the intent of the speaker, but the perceptions and interpretation of the recipient, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Later on, he came across anthropological writing that brought this idea home. Indigenous Amazonian &amp;ldquo;perspectivism&amp;rdquo; is the conception that &amp;ldquo;the world is inhabited by different sorts of subjects or persons, human and non-human, which apprehend reality from distinct points of view.&amp;rdquo; Nayler pays homage to this tradition through the book-within-a-book in his novel, Dr Ha Nguyen&amp;rsquo;s monograph &amp;ldquo;How Oceans Think&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a reference to anthropologist Eduardo Kohn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;How Forests Think&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;For Bridle too, forests provided the germinal moment. &amp;ldquo;I had a series of encounters where it very much felt like the Universe was kind of knocking on the door and being like, hey, you need to pay attention to these things,&amp;rdquo; Bridle told me. &amp;ldquo;The first direct encounter was with Suzanne Simard and her work in the forests of Western Canada. I was completely blown away by the things she explained about the way in which the forest was operating, the way the forests work and the way they live and the way they communicate and share resources.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Simard&amp;rsquo;s research explores how roots and fungi form a network of communication and resource-sharing between trees. This research inspired Richard Powers&amp;rsquo; novel &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt;, which was also a catalyst for Bridle, who writes, &amp;ldquo;As I read it, I felt something shift in myself, a sense of having been blind all my life to events and processes, whole other lives that surround us all the time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Origins of thought&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;For both writers, moving away from their home countries of the UK and the US was important to the development of their thinking &amp;ndash; but moving away from big global cities to more rural and peripheral locations proved even more impactful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Living in different cultures has a huge effect because it makes you question everything that you know,&amp;rdquo; Bridle told me. &amp;ldquo;Examining the assumptions of one&amp;rsquo;s own culture is the necessary prerequisite for any kind of new critical thinking.&amp;rdquo; In particular, moving to a small Greek island enabled &amp;ldquo;a much more intense and personal relationship with the more-than-human world than I&amp;rsquo;d had previously in my whole life&amp;rdquo;. For Nayler, his time living in Turkmenistan with the Peace Corps revealed to him all the ways in which his American culture was in fact the strange and &amp;ldquo;alienating&amp;rdquo; one, in contrast to the slower-paced, highly social Turkmen life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ways of Being&lt;/em&gt; refers extensively to Indigenous thought, from Tyson Yunkaporta on thinking with stones, to the sortition voting methods of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy. When we spoke, however, Bridle told me how they were not solely seeking traditional ecological knowledge or models of alternate social relations from outside European cultures, but also from within:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was looking to people in Greece, to histories of magic in southern Italy, to traditional folk music: I cite the Sami joikers or Corsican and Sardinian folk singers. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned as much from people who forest forage for plants on my own island and the relationship they have with them as I have by reading about plant work in the Americas or elsewhere. So I do think it&amp;rsquo;s possible to learn from one&amp;rsquo;s own traditional knowledge as well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Some writers might react against the western capitalist worldview by fetishising traditional rural or Indigenous lifeways. Instead, Bridle and Nayler are attempting something more interesting: a counter-reading of western science that finds there has been space for ecosystemic thinking and more-than-human community all along. Recall &lt;em&gt;Braiding Sweetgrass&lt;/em&gt;, by Robin Wall Kimmerer, who is both an enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation and Professor of Environmental and Forest Biology at the State University of New York (SUNY). In a 2017 magazine interview, Kimmerer said that &amp;ldquo;I wanted readers to understand that Indigenous knowledge and western science are both powerful ways of knowing, and that by using them together we can imagine a more just and joyful relationship with the Earth.&amp;rdquo; Connection and interdependence might be lessons from Indigenous thought and ecology both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Systems thinking has been fighting its way into public and academic awareness for a very long time,&amp;rdquo; Nayler told me, &amp;ldquo;starting maybe even as early as the late 19th century.&amp;rdquo; As Nayler points out, it&amp;rsquo;s a theme that appears in Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;, in which he emphasises that the key point is not the struggle for survival in one species, but a tangle of interconnected life:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Bridle also recruits Darwin as an early ally to the cause of more-than-human thought. In 1838 the naturalist took to visiting an orangutan named Jenny at London Zoo, bringing her a mouth organ to play on. &amp;ldquo;Let man visit Ouranoutang in domestication . . . see its intelligence . . . and then let him boast of his proud preeminence,&amp;rdquo; Darwin wrote in his notebook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Systems theory is an interdisciplinary field, based on the principle of studying systems holistically, rather than as atomised parts. In 1948 came Norbert Wiener&amp;rsquo;s founding work &lt;em&gt;Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine&lt;/em&gt;, which developed the idea of self-organising systems. In 1972, Donella Meadows and colleagues published &amp;ldquo;The Limits To Growth&amp;rdquo; report, based on the global computer model they&amp;rsquo;d developed, evaluating the circumstances that would lead to environmental collapse. At the same time, James Lovelock was developing Gaia theory: the idea of the Earth and its inhabitants as a self-regulating whole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Nayler observed that &amp;ldquo;I think the reason systems theory feels like it&amp;rsquo;s everywhere right now is because it&amp;rsquo;s finally starting to bubble to the surface in public discourse, after having been an argument that&amp;rsquo;s been going on in science for generations. My counter question would just be why it seems to have taken such a long time to address what seems to be obvious, actually, to quite a few people for a very long time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;The need for a new model&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;So, why now? &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re all desperately searching for a way of making sense of a world that has clearly gone quite horrifically in the wrong direction, and is proceeding further in that direction all the time,&amp;rdquo; Bridle said when I put this to them. &amp;ldquo;And so there&amp;rsquo;s a need for new knowledge and new understandings. We need to build those actively. It requires thought, it requires the construction of new models and metaphors of how the world works.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;We live in a doubly existential moment. We have named an entire geological era, the Anthropocene, for our abilities to terraform the planet &amp;ndash; and yet we fear that we are unable to terraform our own culture enough to make it compatible with sustaining life. Meanwhile, as Bridle writes, &amp;ldquo;the new-found sophistication of our own technologies threatens to supersede us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;This summer, AI image-generation tools have raised questions over what we had thought to be the most human of skills: artistry. Meanwhile, &amp;ldquo;longtermist&amp;rdquo; thinkers fret over the risks of artificial general intelligence &amp;ndash; the name given to the prospect of AI becoming able to learn flexibly and meet or exceed human intellectual capabilities. Bridle describes this as &amp;ldquo;a new Copernican trauma&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;wherein we find ourselves standing on a ruined planet, not smart enough to save ourselves, and no longer by any stretch of imagination the smartest living things around.&amp;rdquo; Through ecology and technology both, we come to a new cosmology in which man is no longer the centre of the universe &amp;ndash; which may be, for some, a shock. Nayler&amp;rsquo;s novel raises the same predicament. In it, Dr Ha Nguyen writes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Communication is communion. When we communicate with others, we take something from them into ourselves, and give them something of ours. Perhaps it is this thought that makes us so nervous about the idea of encountering cultures outside the human. The thought that what it means to be human will shift &amp;ndash; and we will lose our footing. Or that we will have to finally take responsibility for our actions in this world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Bridle agrees, writing that &amp;ldquo;Our very survival depends upon our ability to make a new compact with the more-than-human world, one which views the intelligence, the innate being of all things &amp;ndash; animal, vegetable and machine . . . as an urgent call to humility and care.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s both a very old idea and the leading edge of contemporary thought. Bridle insists passionately that &amp;ldquo;All of this efflorescence of new thinking in this area &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; new thinking, even if a lot of it draws upon traditional knowledge and Indigenous practices, or obscure critical theory, or quite complex novel scientific thinking. All of it is new thinking, because it&amp;rsquo;s being done by new people and phrased in different ways that allows it to be understood in new ways. And it constructs new people by doing that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Because that is the work to be done. The ultimate gift of this more-than-human thinking might be to make us more humane.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Q&amp;A: Adam Rutherford</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6067/qa-adam-rutherford#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Adam-Rutherford-by-Stefan-Jakubowski1.jpg" height="1063" alt="Adam Rutherford" width="1596"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adam Rutherford is a geneticist, author, broadcaster and President of Humanists UK. His latest book is &amp;ldquo;Control: The Dark History and Troubling Present of Eugenics&amp;rdquo; (Weidenfeld &amp;amp; Nicolson).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your latest book explores the history of eugenics. How did the movement come about? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;The idea that you can change population structure, or control how demographics work by restricting reproduction, or by planned marriages, goes back to [antiquity]. Plato talks about it very explicitly in &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;. But the Victorian English polymath Francis Galton gave eugenics its renaissance. He defined it as the moulding of populations &lt;br&gt;according to the desirability of particular characteristics. Galton was piggybacking off what was then new science by Charles Darwin: evolution by natural selection. I&amp;rsquo;m very clear, however, that eugenics is a political ideology, not a scientific project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you describe Galton and Darwin as racist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Francis Galton was a white supremacist in an extreme way, even for his time. Darwin expressed views about racial hierarchy that were pretty typical for the 19th century. But he was not wedded to the essentialist views of most of the scientific racists of that era. The central argument of scientific racism is that racial characteristics, which today we call phenotypes, cannot change. Darwin essentially mocked that view in his book &lt;em&gt;The Descent of Man&lt;/em&gt;. Conversely, he suggested that there is continuity between these sets of characteristics and that none of these characteristics are immutable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Scientific racism is expressed in Darwin&amp;rsquo;s work. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t central to it. In Galton&amp;rsquo;s work, it is. Does that make me an apologist for Darwin? Perhaps, I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You write that &amp;ldquo;The pathway of eugenics led directly to the gates of Auschwitz.&amp;rdquo; One figure you write about was Alfred Ploetz. Who was he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Ploetz was a driving force in the eugenics movement in Germany, which started in the 1890s. He was wedded to the idea of Nordic purity. He met Galton and was inspired by him. The term &amp;ldquo;racial hygiene&amp;rdquo;, which became the Nazi equivalent of eugenics, essentially ripped off the idea of public hygiene, which gained momentum in Germany during the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;In 1913 the German Society for Racial Hygiene, which Ploetz founded, had just a few hundred members. By the time Hitler came to power [two decades later], it had tens of thousands of doctors signed up. Which seems extraordinary, given that many of the fundamental ideals inherent to the German eugenics project focused on sterilising deformed babies, and people with disabilities or diseases like epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the American eugenics movement was also influential on Nazi Germany?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;The link [with Nazi racial science] is unequivocal, well-documented and direct. They took intellectual, scientific, financial and legal inspiration from the American eugenicists. The eugenics laboratories in Berlin during the Third Reich were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Also, the key players in the American eugenics movement included figures like Harry Laughlin and Charles Davenport. Laughlin helped draft important legislation which created a legal framework for involuntary sterilisation in the United States during the 1920s. This was the main inspiration for the Nuremberg Race Laws in Germany during the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also worth pointing out that the Americans were inspired by the British. But Britain never had a formal eugenics policy. There were, of course, many attempts to pass legislation [allowing involuntary sterilisation]. This was led by Winston Churchill, who, like Galton, was a white supremacist. The Americans, however, had eugenics policies in 31 states for the majority of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about China today and the practice of forced sterilisation, which appears to have resulted in a drop in birth rates among the Uyghur population?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;There are many challenges in trying to understand what has been happening in the last few years with regards to the Uyghurs, in what appear to be, according to some reports, effectively concentration camps . . . What the Chinese are doing as a state in this area is not very well known at all, and those allegations coming from Xinjiang are hard to verify.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the technologies that emerged out of former eugenics labs is prenatal screening. Does giving parents a choice to abort a foetus with Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome count as eugenics? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty clear about this: routinely screening pregnancies for conditions such as Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome, and offering women the choice of terminating that pregnancy, doesn&amp;rsquo;t count as eugenics. Eugenics is considered a top-down, state-imposed sanctioning of reproductive rights. And selective abortion or embryo selection, in response to conditions or diseases, is a manifestation of parental choice. But this is partially a semantic argument and partially a political one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you consult any parents of children with Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome for your research? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Yes. I did. And many of them disagree with me. They say the ready availability of abortions for foetuses diagnosed with Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome, or even with the potential risk, is a manifestation of eugenics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You note in your book how in Denmark and Iceland, for instance, roughly 99 per cent of parents choose to abort such foetuses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Yes, and this means incidence of Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome has effectively dropped to zero in those countries. That does indeed begin to look like a eugenics project. It really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether we call it eugenics or not. The real impact is that there is a group of people who exist today, who, through advances in technology and reproductive medicine, may not continue to exist in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your work shows how science, history and politics are connected. Does the scientific community do enough to acknowledge this interconnection? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;There is a natural tendency for scientists to think that because we have set up these methodologies, we&amp;rsquo;re not influenced by politics, psychological biases, or historical and social contexts. That is a noble aim, but it&amp;rsquo;s impossible. Mainly because science is done by humans, and it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to extract our own biases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You call the story of humankind one of &amp;ldquo;wonderful impurity&amp;rdquo;. What do you mean by that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;The history of humankind is indeed a story of continuous mixing, constant migration and shared ancestry. A very small proportion of humans moved out of Africa in the last 100,000 years. Since then, we have populated every corner of the world. What we now know is that those migrations happened gradually. So, what you see, in reality, is that there is a constant mixing of populations when average populations move from place A to place B. During those migrations, people have sex and have babies. That is the real story of human biodiversity, rather than the creationist view of humans, which talks about people moving out of Eden, as described in the book of&lt;em&gt; Genesis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So family trees are less linear than we think?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;We tend to think of our family trees as being these neat branching structures with these nice narratives, which satisfy our desire to understand where we come from. But such stories only tell a tiny fraction of what the total sum of our ancestry actually is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interview by J. P. O&amp;rsquo;Malley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p></div>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;
