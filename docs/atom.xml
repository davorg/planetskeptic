<p class="lead">The Washington Post is claiming that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/birds-song-nature-mental-health-benefits/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f005">listening to bird songs is good for you</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking to improve your mental health? Pay attention to birds.</p>
<p>Two studies published last year in Scientific Reports said that seeing or hearing birds could be good for our mental well-being.</p>
<p>So give them a listen as you learn why they may help.</p>
<p>Research has consistently shown that more contact and interaction with nature are associated with better body and brain health.</p>
<p>Birds appear to be a specific source of these healing benefits. They are almost everywhere and provide a way to connect us to nature. And even if they are hidden in trees or in the underbrush, we can still revel in their songs.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, fine, I will believe that going on regular walks in the park, paying attention to your environment, and living in a place compatible with other living things, is beneficial. I object to the idea that the effect is specific to birds. Why not spiders? A stroll in the park and checking out the trees and underbrush is something you can do while spidering, too.</p>
<p>You aren’t going to hear spider songs unless you have much better ears than I’ve got, but on the plus side, spiders don’t start shrieking and screeching and whistling outside your bedroom window at 5am.</p>

<p class="lead">I have turned in all my grades, and it’s beginning to sink in that there will not be a relaxing summer of relaxation. We’ve got an arachnology conference coming up at the end of June — the core data is all done, but we’ve got some details to fill in and lots of pretty photos to take, and we have an ongoing project in putting together a staging series. We’re also going to make some field trips throughout the summer to get out of the lab and see some sunshine and more exotic spiders. I’m also reviving my course in developmental ecology next spring, so I’ve got to do all the prep work for that this summer.</p>

But inside the carapace, it is hollowed out. A rapidly diminishing number identify with it, share its metaphysical beliefs, subscribe to its positions on LGBTQI+ equality, or attend its services.

And this interest is set to increase, if the 2021 UK census is a benchmark. It showed that over the past decade, there has been a 12-fold increase in British people stating their religion as Shamanism... Behind the headlines, however, Shamanism&amp;rsquo;s complex origins are surprising and rarely understood."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The summer 2023 issue of New Humanist is on sale now! &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt; for as little as &amp;pound;10 a year for a digital subscription, or &amp;pound;27 for a print subscription.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in this issue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ACV_KeyArt11__960x540-copy.jpg" height="437" alt="Video game graphics" width="770"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;How &lt;strong&gt;Samira Ahmed&lt;/strong&gt; discovered a lost Beatles tape&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominic Hinde&lt;/strong&gt; takes a road trip through US coal country to see how efforts to champion green energy are playing out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenan Malik&lt;/strong&gt; argues that a deep and paralysing pessimism underlies Critical Race Theory and the struggle for equality&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rachel Muller-Heyndyk&lt;/strong&gt; explores how neo-Nazis are weaponising video games&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noah Berlatsky&lt;/strong&gt; looks at the history of ChatGPT-style poetry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Historian &lt;strong&gt;Mathew Lyons&lt;/strong&gt; reflects on how caring for his father through Alzheimer's raised questions about identity and memory&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conor Feehly&lt;/strong&gt; on whether intuition plays a role in science&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andy Field&lt;/strong&gt; on our love-hate relationship with voice notes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christopher Shrimpton&lt;/strong&gt; discovers the cruel history of portrayals of women in art&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;PLUS: Columns from &lt;strong&gt;Michael Rosen&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Laurie Taylor &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Marcus Chown&lt;/strong&gt;, book reviews, poems, cryptic crossword and &lt;strong&gt;Chris Maslanka&lt;/strong&gt;'s quiz&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe to the print edition now to get a beautiful copy of the magazine delivered to your door, or choose a digital subscription to read it on the app.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Humanist, a quarterly magazine of culture, ideas, science and philosophy, is published by the &lt;a href="https://rationalist.org.uk/"&gt;Rationalist Association&lt;/a&gt;, a 136-year-old charity promoting reason and free enquiry. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Poor Peterson, beset on all sides</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/17/poor-peterson-beset-on-all-sides/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Jordan-Peterson-the-Target.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Jordan-Peterson-the-Target.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="291" class="alignright size-full wp-image-70145" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Jordan-Peterson-the-Target.jpg 200w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Jordan-Peterson-the-Target-103x150.jpg 103w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"/></a></p>
<p class="lead">I’ve said before that Jordan Peterson is a bad biologist, not any kind of biologist at all, and especially not an evolutionary biologist. When someone knowledgeable in the field looks at his expertise, he’s <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/10/am-i-surprised-that-jordan-peterson-was-a-bad-psychiatrist/">not even a good clinical psychologist</a>. What, exactly, is he supposed to be good at? We can definitely say <a href="https://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2023/05/11/jordan-peterson-does-not-understand-ancient-languages/">it sure isn’t ancient languages and the Bible</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>…I discuss in detail how Peterson routinely tries to use ancient myths and the Bible to support his various noxious viewpoints, despite the fact that he has absolutely no understanding of the academic study of these subjects and his interpretations of them display a profound ignorance of the historical and cultural contexts from which they originate and how ancient audiences understood them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peterson frequently makes etymological arguments, which I’ve always found silly and are typically used <em>creatively</em> by know-nothings to make rhetorical points. Fake etymologies are common on the internet. The annoying thing about Peterson is that he uses them to sound “scholarly,” but he’s using them in bizarre ways.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>By the way, sin. There’s two derivations of the word sin: one is chet, which is from the Hebrew, and the other is hamartia, from the Greek. And they both are archery terms that mean to miss the target.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then he goes on to babble about sports arenas and crowds and I don’t know what, all while gesturing madly. It’s <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.jordan.b.peterson/video/7198284246824340741">weird display</a>. Very cringe.</p>
<p>But he’s getting everything wrong! Not that that would slow him down in the slightest.</p>
<blockquote><p>In these few short sentences, Peterson has already made three serious errors. First, he mispronounces the Hebrew word חֵטְא (ḥeṭʾ)—a noun derived from the verbal root ח־ט־א (ḥ-ṭ-ʾ)—as /t͡ʃɛt/ (pronouncing the ⟨ḥ⟩ at the beginning like the ⟨ch⟩ in cheese) when it should actually be pronounced /χɛt/. This is a pronunciation mistake that no one who actually knows anything about Hebrew would make, since the sound /t͡ʃ/ does not exist in ancient or modern Hebrew. By mispronouncing the word in this blatant manner, Peterson clearly demonstrates that he does not even know the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<p>Second, Peterson claims that these words are “derivations of the word sin,” but this is factually incorrect. Neither of these words is the etymological root of the English word sin; instead, they are ancient Hebrew and Greek words that occur in the texts of the Bible that modern translators normally render into English as the word sin because translators have decided (whether rightly or wrongly) that sin is the closest English equivalent of these terms.</p>
<p>Etymologically speaking, the English word sin actually derives from the Middle English word sinne, which derives from the Old English word synn, which derives from the Proto-West Germanic word *sunnju, meaning “responsibility,” “care,” “worry,” or “need.” This word, in turn, derives from the Proto-Germanic word *sunjō, meaning “truth.” This, in turn, comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₁sónts, meaning “a thing which exists or is true,” which is the active participle of the Proto-Indo-European verb *h₁es-, meaning “to be.”</p>
<p>Third and finally, Peterson claims that both the Hebrew word ḥeṭʾ and the Greek word ἁμαρτία are “archery terms,” but this is only partly true. It is true that ancient texts do use both of these words to refer to when a person shoots an arrow or throws a spear and misses their intended target. Nonetheless, ancient texts also use both of these words in a much more general sense to refer to any kind of mistake or failure that a person makes. In fact, some of the earliest attested occurrences of the word ἁμαρτάνω use it in this more general sense to mean simply “make a mistake.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll take the author’s word for it all, but using a tenuous link between sin and archery is already ridiculous. It’s an unwarranted extrapolation and interpretation, even if the etymology were correct. It’s like if I were talking about developmental biology, using technical terms we take for granted, like “competence” and “induction” and “determination,” and used a dictionary to declare that we thought embryos were self-willed intelligent beings. No, it’s more that embryologists in the 1920s were enamored with psychology and were borrowing terms to apply to concepts that had absolutely nothing to do with minds.</p>
<p>Peterson is that clueless nerd with a dictionary making stuff up to justify his conclusions.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hallo, I’m Skatje Myers, a PhD student in Computer Science (joint degree in Cognitive Science) at the University of Colorado at Boulder, advised by Martha Palmer.</p>
<p>My research focus is in accelerating development of new corpora for semantic role labels (SRL).</p>
<p>I’m investigating techniques for conducting active learning for semantic role labeling: How can we determine which sentences will most improve the model when annotated and added to our training data? This methodology enables us to improve annotation efficiency by selecting only the most informative sentences to annotate.</p>
<p>Additionally, I’m examining approaches for projecting semantic annotation cross-lingually: If we know what the semantic roles are in an English sentence, and we know the translation of that sentence, can we figure out which words to assign those roles to in the target language? These projected annotations may serve either as a starting point for manual annotation that will expedite the process, or as training data themselves.</p>
<p>I’m presently exploring these techniques specifically in regards to developing and expanding a Russian PropBank corpus.</p></blockquote>

    <title>Criminalisation of abortion endangers women and girls - including in the UK</title>

As some states moved to criminalise abortion, there was outcry against the idea of pregnant women being treated as criminals for exerting agency over their own bodies. But, as a new report from researchers at the World Health Organization (WHO) makes clear, criminalisation of abortion is the norm, not the exception, globally. Of the 182 countries for which there was data as of October 2022, abortion was completely decriminalised in just one: Canada. Penalties range from fines to, in a handful of countries, life imprisonment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the UK there is a widespread belief that abortion is not a crime. In England, Scotland and Wales, the procedure is legal if authorised by two doctors before 24 weeks&amp;rsquo; gestation, or in cases where there are serious health risks to continuing the pregnancy. But it remains criminalised outside these parameters under legislation passed in 1861.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, at least two women were charged with abortion-related offences in England, both for allegedly taking abortion pills after the 24-week limit. One of the cases was dropped after prosecutors agreed it was not in the public interest to pursue it; the other woman pled guilty to unlawfully administering a poison or noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage, an offence under the 1861 law, and is awaiting sentencing. This year, already, at least two more people have been charged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dozens of women have also been investigated over the past decade, according to a recent report in the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;. Some were arrested in their hospital beds; at least one was jailed. A girl as young as 15 had her phone and laptop confiscated, for investigation, during her GCSE exams. Police produced text exchanges with her boyfriend, where she expressed doubt over having the baby, as evidence against her, before a coroner concluded that the pregnancy had ended due to natural causes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Northern Ireland maintained a near-total ban on abortions until 2020, when Westminster took advantage of the collapse of Stormont&amp;rsquo;s power-sharing deal to intervene. There are still 11 countries &amp;ndash; including Andorra and Malta &amp;ndash; where abortion is prohibited in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The great irony of these laws is that they don&amp;rsquo;t reduce abortions. A study in 2020 from researchers at the Guttmacher Institute and WHO found that the abortion rate was the same in countries where it was &amp;ldquo;broadly legal&amp;rdquo; as in those where it was completely banned. Meanwhile, even partial criminalisation can be dangerous, because it can discourage or delay women from seeking safe abortions and cause health workers to be overly cautious, even to the point of denying legal forms of care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evidence is clear: criminalisation only serves to limit safe and regulated abortions, while putting women and girls at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a preview from New Humanist's summer 2023 issue. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Malaria vaccine: A scientific victory</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6116/malaria-vaccine-a-scientific-victory#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Diana Polekhina on Unsplash" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/diana-polekhina-ZBstHWt9vLc-unsplash.jpg" height="850" alt="A stock photo of a syringe containing a yellow liquid" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Ghana became the first country in the world to approve a highly effective malaria vaccine, an achievement 80 years in the making. Known as R21, it is the first for malaria &amp;ndash; or indeed any parasitic disease &amp;ndash; to exceed the World Health Organization&amp;rsquo;s 75 per cent efficacy target. Parasites are much more complex than viruses or bacteria, so this is a major breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Preliminary results from final-stage trials have not yet been published, but Ghana has already cleared the vaccine for use in children aged 5-36 months &amp;ndash; the group at highest risk of death from malaria. Nigeria followed suit shortly afterwards. The WHO is still reviewing the data to determine whether it will recommend the vaccine for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge of targeting the malaria parasite is that it changes its structure throughout its lifecycle. R21 targets the parasite at a very early stage, before it has spread extensively throughout the body. This rapid response is helped along by an &amp;ldquo;adjuvant&amp;rdquo; (an ingredient that boosts the body&amp;rsquo;s immune response to vaccines) called Matrix-M, which comes from the Chilean soapbark tree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another major obstacle has been funding. Pharmaceuticals typically invest in vaccines expecting to recoup the costs by selling them to wealthy countries. But malaria mostly affects lower-income countries. R21 was developed by researchers at Oxford University&amp;rsquo;s Jenner Institute, which also developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19. Their work was supported by awards from the European Commission, UK Research and Innovation, the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Serum Institute of India, among others. According to Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, it is the first major vaccine to be approved by an African country before rich nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new vaccine is no silver bullet. Doubts remain about the reported efficacy as trials continue, and about the practicalities of delivery, as it requires three initial doses and possibly boosters, which can be a challenge in rural areas. Funding for a widespread rollout also remains an issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, R21 marks a major scientific advancement and brings significant hope in the fight against one of the world&amp;rsquo;s deadliest diseases. It comes on the back of two decades of impressive progress against malaria, mainly through the use of antimalarial drugs, insecticides and nets. The disease has already been eliminated in 15 countries since 2000. Global eradication once seemed impossible. Increasingly, it looks like a practical aim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>An assault on our rights</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Medical staff block Lambeth Bridge, London, during a climate protest. Credit: Alisdare Hickson" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Stop_Financing_Fossil_Fuels__51997248014_-credit-Alisdare-Hickson.jpg" height="1080" alt="A group of medical professionals block Lambeth Bridge in London to protest against fossil fuel extraction" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; went to press last week, the Public Order Act had just become law, introducing new police powers to restrict protests in the UK. It comes on the back of high-profile demonstrations in recent years that have seen groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Black Lives Matter take actions such as blocking roads, airports and printing presses in a bid to raise public awareness and push politicians into action. Some of the new restrictions came into effect just days before the coronation of King Charles III, ahead of anticipated anti-monarchy protests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government says it &amp;ldquo;fully supports the right of individuals to engage in peaceful protest&amp;rdquo; but that the &amp;ldquo;guerrilla tactics&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;serious disruption caused by a small minority of protestors has highlighted that more needs to be done to protect the public and businesses from these unacceptable actions.&amp;rdquo; But if Rishi Sunak and his party &amp;ldquo;fully support&amp;rdquo; the right to protest, they&amp;rsquo;re doing an impressive job of hiding it. They already introduced new restrictions last year, under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. That act increased the instances in which police could intervene in protests. Intentionally &amp;ldquo;causing a public nuisance&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; an offence which could cover peaceful actions like blocking the entrance to a building, or occupying a public space &amp;ndash; is now punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and the jailing of peaceful protesters has already begun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new law goes further again. It introduces new criminal offences, including &amp;ldquo;locking on&amp;rdquo;, where protestors chain themselves to buildings or objects, a tactic that was famously used by the suffragettes in the 1900s. That is now punishable by up to six months in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also newly criminalised are &amp;ldquo;obstructing major transport works&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;interfering with key national infrastructure&amp;rdquo; (the government has specifically mentioned airports and printing presses, both of which have been the sites of climate protests), and &amp;ldquo;tunnelling&amp;rdquo;, which is defined as &amp;ldquo;creating&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;being present&amp;rdquo; in a tunnel, &amp;ldquo;where such an act is causing or capable of causing serious disruption&amp;rdquo;. This last offence seems to specifically target anti-HS2 protesters, some of whom have occupied tunnels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law also allows magistrates to ban particular people from attending protests, and extends police powers, allowing officers to stop and search people without suspicion of any wrongdoing in and near protest sites. Under normal circumstances, police generally need to have &amp;ldquo;reasonable grounds&amp;rdquo; to suspect that someone is carrying an illegal item or something that could be used to commit a crime in order to stop and search them. Even then, the racial discrimination involved in that assessment of suspicion is well known and there is little evidence that it is an effective tool to fight crime. These efforts to pre-emptively clamp down on protests are deeply concerning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lords rejected some of the most serious provisions &amp;ndash; including a government bid to restrict the use of the right to protest on &amp;ldquo;an issue of current debate&amp;rdquo; as a defence in court. But this is not enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human rights organisations, and some politicians and lawyers, have condemned the law as an assault on democratic freedoms. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T&amp;uuml;rk, called on the government to reverse the legislation. The new law imposes &amp;ldquo;disproportionate criminal sanctions on people organising or taking part in peaceful protests,&amp;rdquo; he said, and is &amp;ldquo;wholly unnecessary as UK police already have the powers to act against violent and disruptive demonstrations&amp;rdquo;. Four UN special rapporteurs on rights have also expressed &amp;ldquo;grave concerns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is, unfortunately, little chance that the government will pay any attention to the international outcry. This regressive law is likely here to stay, with far-reaching consequences for our democracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Demons of sleep</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6114/demons-of-sleep#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'Night and Sleep' by Evelyn De Morgan. Credit: Heritage Image Partnership" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/MPWRM3.jpg" height="1324" alt="'Night and Sleep' (1878), a painting by Evelyn De Morgan, shows two people drifting through the air" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sleep is a hot topic these days. Popular science books promise to uncover why we do it at all, while exploring its importance for a healthy life. Self-help manuals seek to teach the art of sleeping well amidst the stresses of modern life. Wearable devices and mobile apps monitor quality and quantity, nudging users to make adjustments to their bedtime routines. Meanwhile, last summer&amp;rsquo;s heatwave produced endless variations of top tips for ensuring the right amount of sleep in sweltering temperatures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These examples do not just point to an increased curiosity for an activity that, after all, makes up a third of our lives. Rather, they suggest a certain anxiety around sleep and a desire to master it. The key goal of Matthew Walker&amp;rsquo;s international bestseller &lt;em&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, was to demonstrate the importance of sleep to a society that, he argues, all too often neglects it with disastrous consequences for our health. That was published in 2018. Since then, the idea that our society may be experiencing a &amp;ldquo;sleep crisis&amp;rdquo; has become more popular, with reports that people&amp;rsquo;s sleep debt &amp;ndash; namely, the difference between the amount of sleep they need and the amount they actually get &amp;ndash; has been rising in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This concern over the number of hours people sleep, or fail to, has led to growing attempts at regimenting and optimising the night-time, be it through sleep-tracking, sleep-hygiene routines and sleep hacks, relaxation apps, or other assorted gadgets, from smart mattresses to smart light systems. Underlying these attempts is the sense that sleep should be harnessed. As one popular sleep-tracking wearable puts it: &amp;ldquo;Sleep more. Achieve more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this landscape, Alice Vernon&amp;rsquo;s new book &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It&lt;/em&gt; offers a breath of fresh air. Vernon highlights the need to widen our conversations around sleep beyond the anxious focus on maximising the number of hours we spend doing it. Her stories of troubled sleep purposefully steer well clear of the subject of insomnia &amp;ndash; a condition that has been the core theme of a recent boom of memoirs, such as Marina Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Insomnia&lt;/em&gt; (2018) and Samantha Harvey&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Shapeless Unease: A Year of Not Sleeping&lt;/em&gt; (2020).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, Vernon turns her attention to sleep disorders like somnambulism (sleepwalking), sleep paralysis and hallucinations. And of course, the titular night terrors: terrifying dreams which will typically cause the sleeper to scream and bolt out of bed, and which, unlike nightmares, the sleeper will typically not remember upon waking. Through exploration of these phenomena, &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; invites us to embrace the weirdness of sleep and to look more closely at aspects of our night lives that often thwart any attempts at control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gateway to consciousness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is many things at once: a vivid memoir of Vernon&amp;rsquo;s own experiences of troubled sleep, an accessible account of the science of the sleep disorders that are collectively known as parasomnias, and a rich cultural history of how these disorders have been interpreted and represented throughout the centuries. Such a fluid approach feels fitting. Sleep is both a subject of scientific research, about which we know more and more, and a phenomenon that can still elude our rationality and even fill us with utter horror, producing endless theories and fuelling the imagination. In skillfully weaving the strands of the book together, Vernon perfectly captures the liminal status of sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parasomnias, the focus of &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt;, are undesirable movements, perceptions, behaviours and emotions that arise as the brain transitions between REM (rapid eye movement) sleep &amp;ndash; the stage when dreams tend to occur &amp;ndash; non-REM sleep and wakefulness. These disorders, Vernon tells us, are quite common: 70 per cent of people experience a parasomnia at least once over the course of their life, typically sleep-talking or nightmares. She points out that the real percentage is probably even higher, given that a feature of some sleep disorders is that, upon waking, people do not have any recollection of what they have experienced during the night. What is more, people may be reluctant to talk about them: there is still a certain stigma attached to these &amp;ldquo;sleep demons&amp;rdquo;, which for centuries were explained away through the supernatural, or seen as a mark of insanity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; argues that we need to talk more about parasomnias, both to combat this stigma and to give voice to what these disorders tell us about ourselves. In Vernon&amp;rsquo;s impassioned writing, parasomnias emerge as an important gateway into different forms of consciousness, both individual and collective &amp;ndash; which we ignore at our peril. &amp;ldquo;Our little upheavals or our major traumas&amp;rdquo;, she writes, &amp;ldquo;can all come back through the trapdoor of sleep, so to ignore this part of ourselves can mean that we never really face what our dreams are telling us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader&amp;rsquo;s journey starts with the very first parasomnia that Vernon experienced as a child: sleepwalking. We then move on to hypnopompic hallucinations &amp;ndash; primarily visual hallucinations that manifest moments after waking up; think spiders scuttling on your pillow. Later on, we explore sleep paralysis, night terrors and, finally, dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A thread running through the book is the story of Vernon&amp;rsquo;s claustrophobic and manipulative relationship with a former teacher, whom she calls Meredith after mara, &amp;ldquo;an Old Norse word for a witch who would lie on people&amp;rsquo;s chests and try to suffocate them&amp;rdquo;. The mara is what we now know to be sleep paralysis, a parasomnia where the body&amp;rsquo;s inability to move &amp;ndash; preventing us from acting out our dreams and hurting ourselves or the people we sleep with &amp;ndash; continues after waking up. The person is lying down, fully awake and conscious, and yet entirely unable to move. Even screaming is impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a paradoxical and terrifying situation. In response, the brain can conjure up images of sinister figures looming over the sleeper and weighing them down, to explain the sensation of being pinned to the bed and the feeling of pressure on one&amp;rsquo;s chest and limbs. While Meredith&amp;rsquo;s oppressive hold on teenage Vernon is linked to a number of Vernon&amp;rsquo;s experiences of parasomnias, it is most clearly reflected in the sleep paralysis &amp;ldquo;demons&amp;rdquo; that populate her nights later on in her life. Vernon describes how, during sleep paralysis, she feels &amp;ldquo;crushed under the intense stare of Meredith, under her hands and her sharp nails&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sleep paralysis, nightmares and dreams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chapter on sleep paralysis is among the most engrossing. Beyond exploring the science of this parasomnia and providing memoiristic insights into the trauma that lies at the root of her own experiences, Vernon traces how the disorder has shaped paranoid beliefs across the ages. Looking at the historical records of the 17th-century Salem witch trials, for instance, Vernon learns how experiences of sleep paralysis generated several accusations of witchcraft in the trials. More recently, this parasomnia is thought to be the origin of many reports of alien abductions that supposedly happened at night and were accompanied by a peculiar heavy feeling. &amp;ldquo;What we see during sleep paralysis,&amp;rdquo; Vernon explains, &amp;ldquo;has changed significantly as our cultural depiction of monsters has shifted&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parasomnias seem to have always played a role in the cultural imagination. &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; is peppered throughout with insightful readings of historical paintings and texts, many of which are iconic, that draw on these strange and powerful phenomena. Vernon&amp;rsquo;s reflections on Dracula, the protagonist of Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s 1897 novel, note that he causes paralysis, somnambulism and night terrors in his victims. He was not just a vampire, she concludes, but &amp;ldquo;every parasomnia combined in the figure of a folkloric monster&amp;rdquo;. Just as vampires straddle life and death so do parasomnias &amp;ndash; during these sleep disorders &amp;ldquo;the waking, rational self is effectively &amp;lsquo;dead&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; The book goes on to illustrate how many of our famous writers, from Robert Louis Stevenson to Shirley Jackson, drew inspiration for their fiction from their real-life experiences of various parasomnias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not just that parasomnias can inspire creativity or that culture can help shed light on these strange sleep phenomena. Rather, Vernon argues that storytelling can have therapeutic potential when it comes to sleep. She points to the DreamsID project, a collaboration between sleep scientist Mark Blagrove and artist Julia Lockheart, in which participants share their dreams, nightmares and other parasomnias, whose findings seem to suggest that the process encourages empathy. Imagery rehearsal therapy is also discussed: a cognitive-behavioural treatment for reducing the number and intensity of parasomnias, where the patient is helped to reimagine their nightmares with different, less terrifying outcomes. There are also attempts being made to harness lucid dreaming, which allows people to be aware that they are sleeping and therefore lets them direct their own dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is something deeply liberating about &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; invitation to encounter sleep on its own terms, in all its weirdness and darkness. As Vernon writes, &amp;ldquo;sleep isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the number of hours, [or] the time it takes to nod off . . . Sleep is about stories. It&amp;rsquo;s about monsters, and ghosts, desires, aggression, trauma and anxiety, health, creativity, and the state of our inner lives.&amp;rdquo; Her book is a powerful reminder of what we miss when we think of sleep merely as something to master, in order that we might be more productive in the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alice Vernon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It&amp;rdquo; is published by Icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer.

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
