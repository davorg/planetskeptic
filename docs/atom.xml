<p class="lead">You knew this would set ol’ Bill’s non-existent hair on fire: the Los Angeles Dodgers invited a drag group, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, to a baseball game, and even apologized for a previous disinvitation. Cue a <a href="https://www.catholicleague.org/dodgers-reinvite-bigoted-sisters/">Catholic League tirade</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>In a statement released to the press, the Dodgers said they had “much thoughtful feedback from our diverse communities, honest conversations within the Los Angeles Dodgers organization and generous discussions with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.” On May 22, the “Sisters” met with Kasten and LGBTQ organizations, as well as local government officials.</p>
<p>There was no indication that Catholic leaders, clergy or lay, were invited to participate in these “honest conversations.” Only one side was listened to—the side that sponsors hate speech. The fact that gay and trans leaders agree with the vulgar anti-Catholic rhetoric and behavior of the “Sisters” means they now have no moral leg to stand on when asking for an end to bigotry against them.</p>
<p>Knowing full well how the ruling class in this country can no longer be trusted, I told my staff yesterday that it wouldn’t surprise me if MLB and the Dodgers reversed course. To that end, I personally went through our files on the “Sisters” and prepared a report on them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cool. So now the Catholic League claims that their bigotry is warranted, because the Catholic church was not invited to a conversation between a baseball team and a <a href="https://www.thesisters.org/">LGBTQ advocacy group</a>. Why would anyone expect Catholic leaders to be invited to everything?</p>
<p>Two things intrigued me, though: one is that he told his “staff” something. He has a staff? What is it, one part-time secretary and the building custodian? He’s another of those people with a history of amplifying his constituency with a fax machine and a bullhorn, like Moms for Liberty, Libs of Tik-Tok, and <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/the-guardians-who-slumbereth-not/">Mel and Norma Gabler</a>.</p>
<p>But the second thing…Bill has a <a href="https://www.catholicleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SISTERS-OF-PERPETUAL-INDULGENCE.pdf">dossier on the the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence</a>? Of course he does. And it makes me like them even more.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist">
<p style="text-align: center">SISTERS OF PERPETUAL INDULGENCE<br/>Bill Donohue</p>
<p>1979: This was the beginning of the Sisters. In San Francisco’s Castro<br/>
District three men dressed in traditional nun’s habit walked the streets.<br/>
One of them carried a machine gun. Then they went to a nude beach. It<br/>
was then that they adopted the name the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.<br/>
1982: A year after AIDS was discovered, the Sisters were upset, but they<br/>
did not complain about the lethal sex practices that gave rise to AIDS;<br/>
rather, they complained about the “fear and prejudice” that it was<br/>
engendering. “Sr. Florence Nightmare” and “Sr. Roz Erection”<br/>
addressed the issue.<br/>
1987: The Sisters were granted a tax-exempt status after trashing Pope<br/>
John Paul II’s visit to San Francisco. The Sisters held an “exorcism” and<br/>
a “Condom Savior Mass” in Union Square. At the event, they featured<br/>
“the Latex Host” and referred to Jesus as “the Condom Savior.” They<br/>
also burned the Pope in effigy.<br/>
1987: They staged a “Hunky Jesus” contest, something they do every<br/>
year on Easter Sunday.<br/>
1989: On their tenth anniversary, they held many events, including one<br/>
with “Sr. Psychedelia’s” rise from the dead, and “Pope Dementia’s<br/>
Altered Boys.” They wore “only thongs and smiles.”<br/>
1989: At the “Condom Savior Mass,” the Sisters read from a text of the<br/>
“Condom Savior Consecration.” It said, “The Latex Host is the flesh for<br/>
the life of the world. Just as the Creator who has life sent us, we have life<br/>
because of the Condom Savior. Those who feed on this latex will have<br/>
life because of it. This is the bread that comes down from Heaven, and,<br/>
unlike those who eat not and therefore die, those who feed on this bread<br/>
shall live forever!”<br/>
1990: A staff writer for the Miami Herald said the Sisters were noted for<br/>
“carrying a 20-foot replica of a penis” at its street events.<br/>
1992: At a rally in Sacramento at the Capital Christian Center, the Sisters<br/>
held signs of the Cross with a pink inverted triangle in the place of Jesus;<br/>
the inscription read, “Stop Crucifying Queers.”<br/>
1992: “On Parade,” a publication of the San Francisco Lesbian/Gay<br/>
Freedom Day Parade and Celebration Committee, published an article by<br/>
“Sister Dana Van Iquity” which said the motto of the Sisters is “Encroach<br/>
not on my crotch!” and “Leave my loins alone.” He described the day’s<br/>
events, including “Dykes on Bikes” and “Dykes with Tikes on Trikes.”<br/>
1993: At another rally at the Capital Christian Center, protesters held a<br/>
sign, “Queer Alert: Fighting for Freedom From Religion.”<br/>
1993: Twelve years after AIDS hit, they demonstrated in Washington,<br/>
“reeling in anger and despair” over five of their members who died of the<br/>
sexually transmitted disease.<br/>
1993: The Sisters were banned from the March on Washington’s stage<br/>
for being “too controversial and not the appropriate image” for C-Span<br/>
and “the movement.”<br/>
1993: The Sisters are seen as so offensive that they incur the wrath of<br/>
Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen, the authors of a landmark book on<br/>
gays, After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of<br/>
Gays in the 90s. They say of the Sisters, “‘Fringe’ gay groups ought to<br/>
have the tact to withdraw voluntarily from public appearance at gay<br/>
parades, marches, and rallies, but they don’t care whether they fatally<br/>
compromise the rest of us.”<br/>
1994: They served “holy communion wafers and tequila” to the<br/>
congregation at a mock Mass.<br/>
1999: On the cover of the April 1, 1999 edition of the San Francisco Bay<br/>
Times there was a full-page picture of a Sister superimposed on a crosslike photo with his hands stretched out, imitating Jesus on the Cross.<br/>
2000: In San Francisco, they held a Good Friday event where they<br/>
sponsored a fetish fashion show that provided “a chance to get spanked<br/>
and free “Sticky Buns.” Dr. Carol Queen held her “Good Vibrations<br/>
Dildo Fashion Show.”<br/>
2001: I petitioned the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Sisters,<br/>
citing multiple examples of “vulgar, obscene and bigoted material against<br/>
the Catholic Church and its members.”<br/>
2002: They celebrated Easter with an “Indulgence in the Park” event that<br/>
featured a “clown-drag-nun” fundraiser, along with the annual “Hunky<br/>
Jesus” contest.<br/>
2004: They spent the entire month of December bashing Christmas in<br/>
Los Angeles.<br/>
2008: San Diego House of the Sisters—The Asylum of the Tortured<br/>
Heart, which was founded in 2005, held a “Midnight Confessional<br/>
Contest” that gave prizes to those with the “hottest confessions.” It was<br/>
held in a gay bar.<br/>
2009: They held a block party in San Francisco where some of the men<br/>
danced naked in the street.<br/>
2010: At the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts winter gala, the Sisters<br/>
were asked to perform six musical acts in a “Nunway Noir” drag fashion<br/>
show where attendees could “bask in the bloody gore of occult film<br/>
screenings.”<br/>
2011: In a Daily Beast column, gay writer Andrew Sullivan called the<br/>
Sisters’ “Hunky Jesus” event a form of “blasphemy.” He was so angry at<br/>
them that he said, “This makes me feel like Bill Donohue.”<br/>
2018: The Multnomah County Library in Portland, Oregon hosted “Drag<br/>
Queen Storytime with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence,” despite their<br/>
history of anti-Catholicism. The event explicitly targeted kids 2-6.<br/>
2022: The Sisters gave an award for featuring Lil Hot Mess, “a man who<br/>
dresses as a woman for children and one of the leading activists behind<br/>
Drag Queen Story Hour.”<br/>
2023: A Sister won the “Free Choice Mary” pro-abortion award. The<br/>
man, dressed with a nun’s veil, wearing a bra and panties, was featured<br/>
holding a baby doll with a sign, “I Had A Choice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I gotta appreciate that not only did they raise the ire of Bill Donohue, but they outraged Andrew Sullivan.</p>
<p>I’m also amused that their great crime in 2004 was spending <q>the entire month of December bashing Christmas in Los Angeles</q>.</p>
<p>I like it!</p>

<p>Orcas are social creatures that can easily learn and reproduce behaviors performed by others, according to the 2022 study. In the majority of reported cases, orcas have made a beeline for a boat’s rudder and either bitten, bent or broken it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m surprised that whales of all species hadn’t taken action <em>centuries</em> ago, when humans started exterminating them wholesale.</p>

    <title>The insufferable pettiness of Anna Krylov</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/23/the-insufferable-pettiness-of-anna-krylov/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/krylov.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/krylov-129x150.jpg" alt="" width="129" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-70184" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/krylov-129x150.jpg 129w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/krylov-257x300.jpg 257w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/krylov.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 129px) 100vw, 129px"/></a></p>
<p class="lead">I just discovered an op-ed from 2021 written by Anna Krylov, the <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/21/oh-yuckthat-was-an-awful-paper-by-krylov-and-her-cronies/">crusader against political correctness</a> whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VN4rzBSjcY">terrible paper I criticized on YouTube</a>. It’s also a terrible opinion piece, but it is evidence that she is trying to launch a career that would appeal to the right wing, and also that she isn’t very thoughtful.</p>
<p>The piece is called <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c01475">The Politicization of Science</a> and it’s the same ol’, same ol’. She starts off by giving her personal history — she grew up in the Soviet Union, in a town that was renamed multiple times in response to the shifting political rule, and she knew people who were denied educational opportunities because they weren’t sufficiently deferential to the powers-that-be. It’s deplorable stuff, and the stupid whims of the political class wrecked many aspects of Russian science. I can see where Krylov is sensitive to the problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after the history lesson, it goes off the rails. She thinks the US is following the same path (and it may, but not for the reasons she cites.)</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Fast forward to 2021–another century. The Cold War is a   distant memory and the country shown on my birth certificate   and school and university diplomas, the USSR, is no longer on   the map. But I find myself experiencing its legacy some   thousands of miles to the west, as if I am living in an Orwellian   twilight zone. I witness ever-increasing attempts to subject   science and education to ideological control and censorship.   Just as in Soviet times, the censorship is being justified by the   greater good. Whereas in 1950, the greater good was advancing   the World Revolution (in the USSR; in the USA the greater   good meant fighting Communism), in 2021 the greater good is   “Social Justice” (the capitalization is important: “Social Justice”   is a specific ideology, with goals that have little in common   with what lower-case “social justice” means in plain   English). As in the USSR, the censorship is enthusiastically imposed also from the bottom, by members of the   scientific community, whose motives vary from naive idealism   to cynical power-grabbing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, wait, wait: I had to stop at that claim that “Social Justice” (capitalized) has little in common with “social justice” (lower case.) That’s weird. I followed her citations to see where that’s coming from, and it’s all Helen Pluckrose, James Lindsay, Peter Boghossian, and John McWhorter — sources that despise the idea of social justice, and have, shall we say, a rather uninformed and biased perspective. But now I was eager to learn about Western censorship.</p>
<p>Her examples are underwhelming.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Today’s censorship does not stop at purging the scientific   vocabulary of the names of scientists who “crossed the line” or   fail the ideological litmus tests of the Elect. In some   schools, physics classes no longer teach “Newton’s Laws”,   but “the three fundamental laws of physics”. Why was Newton canceled? Because he was white, and the new ideology   calls for “decentering whiteness” and “decolonizing” the   curriculum. A comment in Nature calls for replacing the   accepted technical term “quantum supremacy” by “quantum   advantage”. The authors regard the English word “supremacy”   as “violent” and equate its usage with promoting racism and   colonialism. They also warn us about “damage” inflicted by   using such terms as “conquest”. I assume “divide-and-conquer”   will have to go too. Remarkably, this Soviet-style ghost-chasing   gains traction. In partnership with their Diversity, Equity, and   Inclusion taskforce, the Information and Technology Services   Department of the University of Michigan set out to purge the   language within the university and without (by imposing   restrictions on university vendors) from such hurtful and racist   terms as “picnic”, “brown bag lunch”, “black-and-white   thinking”, “master password”, “dummy variable”, “disabled   system”, “grandfathered account”, “strawman argument”, and   “long time no see”. “The list is not exhaustive and will   continue to grow”, warns the memo. Indeed, new words are canceled every day–I just learned that the word “normal” will   no longer be used on Dove soap packaging because “it makes   most people feel excluded.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What does it mean that Newton was “canceled”? How? We still learn about his work, Newton still gets a prominent place in the history of science, and calling the laws he discovered “fundamental” seems more important than calling them “Newton’s.”</p>
<p>She cites a letter published in Nature expressing an opinion — you know, like Krylov is doing in the Journal of Physical Chemistry letters — that suggests some of the terminology used in computing is poor. In the 17 December 2019 issue of Nature, Carmen Palacios-Berraquero, Leonie Mueck &amp; Divya M. Persaud say:</p>
<blockquote><p>We take issue with the use of ‘supremacy’ when referring to quantum computers that can out-calculate even the fastest supercomputers (F. Arute et al. Nature 574, 505–510; 2019). We consider it irresponsible to override the historical context of this descriptor, which risks sustaining divisions in race, gender and class. We call for the community to use ‘quantum advantage’ instead.</p>
<p>The community claims that quantum supremacy is a technical term with a specified meaning. However, any technical justification for this descriptor could get swamped as it enters the public arena after the intense media coverage of the past few months.</p>
<p>In our view, ‘supremacy’ has overtones of violence, neocolonialism and racism through its association with ‘white supremacy’. Inherently violent language has crept into other branches of science as well — in human and robotic spaceflight, for example, terms such as ‘conquest’, ‘colonization’ and ‘settlement’ evoke the terra nullius arguments of settler colonialism and must be contextualized against ongoing issues of neocolonialism.</p>
<p>Instead, quantum computing should be an open arena and an inspiration for a new generation of scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, if I were working in the field of quantum computing I’d take that into account, and I can see their point. All it is, though, is a strong suggestion in a scientific journal, exactly equivalent (although far less wordy) to what Krylov was doing…but she is oblivious to the comparison. It’s <em>terrible</em> that anyone would talk about the uses of language, but only when the interpretations differ from Anna Krylov’s.</p>
<p>Another example she gives is a set of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11a8cUt1SCfIxQRBZk_TnRYM5ltENL7LI/view">recommendations from the “Words Matter” Task Force at the University of Michigan</a>. I confess, there’s a lot in there that I find silly and pointless, such as discouraging the use of the phrase “brown bag lunch” (yeah, that’s what color paper bags are!), but others are worthwhile, such as avoiding the word “crippled” to refer to broken systems, or let’s call “man-hours” “person-hours”. It’s all very bureaucratic, but it’s not censorship or oppression.</p>
<p>That a capitalist company would not want to alienate potential customers by implying that they might be abnormal is also not censorship. She should be far more concerned that I’ve been trying to avoid the use of the “normal” word in my classes, replacing it with less judgmental words like “typical” or “common”. Is color-blindedness not normal? Should I imply that a few students in my class are abnormal because they’re not trichromatic? Krylov is even sillier than that U. Michigan list.</p>
<p>That’s the real problem here. Some people, mostly conservatives and Republicans, are trying to distract us with trivial, petty nonsense as far more serious problems are taking over this country. Sure, go ahead and complain that you’ll continue to defy the tyranny of the Left trying to rename “brown bag” lunches — but meanwhile, the Right is banning books, firing teachers who dare to mention that they’re not heterosexual, outlawing women’s health procedures, and making life a living hell for trans people. Those concerns don’t get mentioned by Krylov. Instead, she wants to damn anyone who tries to expand education to historically deprived groups by removing biases. All in the name of saving humanity.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>The answer is simple: our future is at stake. As a community, we face an important choice. We can succumb to extreme left ideology and spend the rest of our lives ghost-chasing and witch-hunting, rewriting history, politicizing science, redefining elements of language, and turning STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education into a farce. Or we can uphold a key principle of democratic society–the free and uncensored exchange of ideas–and continue our core mission, the pursuit of truth, focusing attention on solving real, important problems of humankind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember: the Unilever corporation removing the word “normal” from their beauty products is an example of “EXTREME LEFT IDEOLOGY.” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/ron-desantis-florida-university-new-college-woke-war">Ron Desantis dismantling academic freedom and appointing a Discovery Institute hack to control a liberal arts college</a>…eh, no big deal.</p>

<blockquote class="creationist"><p>As believers, we cannot in good conscience use transgendered pronouns—no matter our intentions—because, in doing so, we are lying. When we use she/her (or Miss or Mrs.) for a man or he/him (or Mr.) for a female, we are participating in the lie that sex/gender is on a spectrum or that a man can be a woman and a woman a man. Or if we use “they/them” (or Mx., etc.) or the myriad of other “pronoun” options today, we are participating in the lie that humans are not innately sexed as either male or female. We’re participating in the lie that humans can choose to be or are naturally androgenous or ambiguous, when that is not true because God has created us either male or female.</p></blockquote>

    <title>Could be grim…but I’ll probably watch it</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/22/could-be-grimbut-ill-probably-watch-it/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;On 2 June, we get a new &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/duggar-documentary-series_n_6467cc92e4b0005c605923ae"&gt;docuseries on the Duggars&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Gothard, and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_in_Basic_Life_Principles"&gt;IBLP cult&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s going to be &lt;em&gt;ugly&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;ll be hours of hateful, stupid people manipulating each other…so kinda like &lt;i&gt;Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&lt;/i&gt;, only with more religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tw1rAMzPf70" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s an interesting new genre: documentaries exposing the seedy, tawdry abuses within religious organizations. I saw one episode of another series, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/the-secrets-of-hillsong-carl-lentz-1850438481"&gt;The Secrets of Hillsong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, this weekend. So far, I&amp;#8217;m not impressed, since it was dedicated to giving Carl Lentz&amp;#8217;s side of the story, and we already know he&amp;#8217;s a creepy sexual predator…so subsequent episodes better give the victims&amp;#8217; side of the story. It promises to get much juicier and unpleasant in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual abuse is a central theme of the first half of the four-part docuseries. Hillsong founder Brian Houston is the one who confronted Lentz on his inappropriate sexual relations and oversaw Lentz’s removal, but Houston, too, would be ousted from the church in 2022 for his own infidelities—and currently faces up to five years in jail for allegedly helping to cover up his father Frank Houston’s sexual abuse of children. In 1977, Frank founded the original iteration of Hillsong, the Sydney Christian Life Centre, but stepped down when pedophilia allegations against him emerged in 1998. Nonetheless, Frank was invited to pray with former President Trump at the White House in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Vanity Fair reported in 2021 that a college student and congregant named Anna Crenshaw alleged that she was sexually abused in 2015 by Hillsong staffer Jason Mays, who had already previously pleaded guilty to indecent assault. Despite these allegations against Mays, Hillsong briefly suspended then reinstated him. Even back in 2018, according to Page Six, whistleblowers in the church sent a letter to leaders citing “verified, widely circulated stories of inappropriate sexual behavior amongst staff/interns,” and characterized Hillsong as “dangerous and a breeding ground for unchecked abuse.” The letter references an unnamed church leader who had “multiple inappropriate sexual relationships with several female leaders and volunteers and was verbally, emotionally, and according to one woman, physically abusive in his relationships with these women.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the allegations levied against Hillsong in FX’s new docuseries expand beyond sexual abuse: Lentz acknowledges deep institutionalized racism that prevented anyone but white men from assuming leadership positions within the international church, while one of Hillsong’s few Black female congregants in Kansas City recalls in the docuseries that she was once physically removed from the church by police when church leaders learned she had spoken out against lacking diversity in the organization. The woman is one of several Black women to allege racial discrimination within the church in the docuseries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cults are rotten all the way through, as demonstrated by IBLP and Hillsong, but somehow their followers are so fervent and sincere, even as they are exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The tiny particle that could answer big questions</title>

The DUNE project will investigate the neutrino &amp;ndash; the tiniest of fundamental particles, meaning &amp;ldquo;the little neutral one&amp;rdquo; in Italian. It is being constructed one mile deep below Sanford Lab in South Dakota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neutrinos are so tiny that they barely interact with anything and simply glide straight through you, through the Earth and out the other side. But these particles have a mighty role to play in helping us understand some of the most fundamental questions in physics: What is the origin of matter and why is there an imbalance of matter and anti-matter? Is there a grand unifying theory that connects all forces? How do black holes form?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 scientists and engineers, from 200 labs and universities across 30 countries, are collaborating to build DUNE in the hope it will reveal key information about this mysterious particle. The DUNE experiment starts with an underground particle accelerator, where particles will smash into a target to generate an intense beam of neutrinos that will travel through the ground towards the detectors. That&amp;rsquo;s the easy part. The real challenge is in the design and construction of huge, highly complex detector systems that are capable of seeing a particle that doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each of four detector modules will be a liquid-argon chamber filled with 17,000 tons of argon. Neutrinos colliding with argon atoms will produce charged particles that in turn knock out electrons that will be detected by 150 2.3m x 6m units of tightly-wound copper beryllium wires, thus providing a signal that can be recorded as neutrino data. And now the DUNE collaboration has announced the exciting news that mass production for this first, colossal detector module has started, after a series of successful prototype tests at CERN.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

And this interest is set to increase, if the 2021 UK census is a benchmark.

    <title>Criminalisation of abortion endangers women and girls - including in the UK</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Image credit: Bret Kavanaugh/Unsplash" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bret-kavanaugh-MIfUp3FA5ek-unsplash.jpg" height="912" alt="An empty hospital bed" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reversal of Roe v Wade in the United States last year sent shockwaves throughout the world. As some states moved to criminalise abortion, there was outcry against the idea of pregnant women being treated as criminals for exerting agency over their own bodies. But, as a new report from researchers at the World Health Organization (WHO) makes clear, criminalisation of abortion is the norm, not the exception, globally. Of the 182 countries for which there was data as of October 2022, abortion was completely decriminalised in just one: Canada. Penalties range from fines to, in a handful of countries, life imprisonment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the UK there is a widespread belief that abortion is not a crime. In England, Scotland and Wales, the procedure is legal if authorised by two doctors before 24 weeks&amp;rsquo; gestation, or in cases where there are serious health risks to continuing the pregnancy. But it remains criminalised outside these parameters under legislation passed in 1861.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, at least two women were charged with abortion-related offences in England, both for allegedly taking abortion pills after the 24-week limit. One of the cases was dropped after prosecutors agreed it was not in the public interest to pursue it; the other woman pled guilty to unlawfully administering a poison or noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage, an offence under the 1861 law, and is awaiting sentencing. This year, already, at least two more people have been charged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dozens of women have also been investigated over the past decade, according to a recent report in the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;. Some were arrested in their hospital beds; at least one was jailed. A girl as young as 15 had her phone and laptop confiscated, for investigation, during her GCSE exams. Police produced text exchanges with her boyfriend, where she expressed doubt over having the baby, as evidence against her, before a coroner concluded that the pregnancy had ended due to natural causes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Northern Ireland maintained a near-total ban on abortions until 2020, when Westminster took advantage of the collapse of Stormont&amp;rsquo;s power-sharing deal to intervene. There are still 11 countries &amp;ndash; including Andorra and Malta &amp;ndash; where abortion is prohibited in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The great irony of these laws is that they don&amp;rsquo;t reduce abortions. A study in 2020 from researchers at the Guttmacher Institute and WHO found that the abortion rate was the same in countries where it was &amp;ldquo;broadly legal&amp;rdquo; as in those where it was completely banned. Meanwhile, even partial criminalisation can be dangerous, because it can discourage or delay women from seeking safe abortions and cause health workers to be overly cautious, even to the point of denying legal forms of care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evidence is clear: criminalisation only serves to limit safe and regulated abortions, while putting women and girls at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a preview from New Humanist's summer 2023 issue. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Malaria vaccine: A scientific victory</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6116/malaria-vaccine-a-scientific-victory#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Diana Polekhina on Unsplash" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/diana-polekhina-ZBstHWt9vLc-unsplash.jpg" height="850" alt="A stock photo of a syringe containing a yellow liquid" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Ghana became the first country in the world to approve a highly effective malaria vaccine, an achievement 80 years in the making. Known as R21, it is the first for malaria &amp;ndash; or indeed any parasitic disease &amp;ndash; to exceed the World Health Organization&amp;rsquo;s 75 per cent efficacy target. Parasites are much more complex than viruses or bacteria, so this is a major breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Preliminary results from final-stage trials have not yet been published, but Ghana has already cleared the vaccine for use in children aged 5-36 months &amp;ndash; the group at highest risk of death from malaria. Nigeria followed suit shortly afterwards. The WHO is still reviewing the data to determine whether it will recommend the vaccine for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge of targeting the malaria parasite is that it changes its structure throughout its lifecycle. R21 targets the parasite at a very early stage, before it has spread extensively throughout the body. This rapid response is helped along by an &amp;ldquo;adjuvant&amp;rdquo; (an ingredient that boosts the body&amp;rsquo;s immune response to vaccines) called Matrix-M, which comes from the Chilean soapbark tree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another major obstacle has been funding. Pharmaceuticals typically invest in vaccines expecting to recoup the costs by selling them to wealthy countries. But malaria mostly affects lower-income countries. R21 was developed by researchers at Oxford University&amp;rsquo;s Jenner Institute, which also developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19. Their work was supported by awards from the European Commission, UK Research and Innovation, the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Serum Institute of India, among others. According to Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, it is the first major vaccine to be approved by an African country before rich nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new vaccine is no silver bullet. Doubts remain about the reported efficacy as trials continue, and about the practicalities of delivery, as it requires three initial doses and possibly boosters, which can be a challenge in rural areas. Funding for a widespread rollout also remains an issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, R21 marks a major scientific advancement and brings significant hope in the fight against one of the world&amp;rsquo;s deadliest diseases. It comes on the back of two decades of impressive progress against malaria, mainly through the use of antimalarial drugs, insecticides and nets. The disease has already been eliminated in 15 countries since 2000. Global eradication once seemed impossible. Increasingly, it looks like a practical aim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>An assault on our rights</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6115/an-assault-on-our-rights#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Medical staff block Lambeth Bridge, London, during a climate protest. Credit: Alisdare Hickson" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Stop_Financing_Fossil_Fuels__51997248014_-credit-Alisdare-Hickson.jpg" height="1080" alt="A group of medical professionals block Lambeth Bridge in London to protest against fossil fuel extraction" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; went to press last week, the Public Order Act had just become law, introducing new police powers to restrict protests in the UK. It comes on the back of high-profile demonstrations in recent years that have seen groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Black Lives Matter take actions such as blocking roads, airports and printing presses in a bid to raise public awareness and push politicians into action. Some of the new restrictions came into effect just days before the coronation of King Charles III, ahead of anticipated anti-monarchy protests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government says it &amp;ldquo;fully supports the right of individuals to engage in peaceful protest&amp;rdquo; but that the &amp;ldquo;guerrilla tactics&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;serious disruption caused by a small minority of protestors has highlighted that more needs to be done to protect the public and businesses from these unacceptable actions.&amp;rdquo; But if Rishi Sunak and his party &amp;ldquo;fully support&amp;rdquo; the right to protest, they&amp;rsquo;re doing an impressive job of hiding it. They already introduced new restrictions last year, under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. That act increased the instances in which police could intervene in protests. Intentionally &amp;ldquo;causing a public nuisance&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; an offence which could cover peaceful actions like blocking the entrance to a building, or occupying a public space &amp;ndash; is now punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and the jailing of peaceful protesters has already begun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new law goes further again. It introduces new criminal offences, including &amp;ldquo;locking on&amp;rdquo;, where protestors chain themselves to buildings or objects, a tactic that was famously used by the suffragettes in the 1900s. That is now punishable by up to six months in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also newly criminalised are &amp;ldquo;obstructing major transport works&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;interfering with key national infrastructure&amp;rdquo; (the government has specifically mentioned airports and printing presses, both of which have been the sites of climate protests), and &amp;ldquo;tunnelling&amp;rdquo;, which is defined as &amp;ldquo;creating&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;being present&amp;rdquo; in a tunnel, &amp;ldquo;where such an act is causing or capable of causing serious disruption&amp;rdquo;. This last offence seems to specifically target anti-HS2 protesters, some of whom have occupied tunnels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law also allows magistrates to ban particular people from attending protests, and extends police powers, allowing officers to stop and search people without suspicion of any wrongdoing in and near protest sites. Under normal circumstances, police generally need to have &amp;ldquo;reasonable grounds&amp;rdquo; to suspect that someone is carrying an illegal item or something that could be used to commit a crime in order to stop and search them. Even then, the racial discrimination involved in that assessment of suspicion is well known and there is little evidence that it is an effective tool to fight crime. These efforts to pre-emptively clamp down on protests are deeply concerning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lords rejected some of the most serious provisions &amp;ndash; including a government bid to restrict the use of the right to protest on &amp;ldquo;an issue of current debate&amp;rdquo; as a defence in court. But this is not enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human rights organisations, and some politicians and lawyers, have condemned the law as an assault on democratic freedoms. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T&amp;uuml;rk, called on the government to reverse the legislation. The new law imposes &amp;ldquo;disproportionate criminal sanctions on people organising or taking part in peaceful protests,&amp;rdquo; he said, and is &amp;ldquo;wholly unnecessary as UK police already have the powers to act against violent and disruptive demonstrations&amp;rdquo;. Four UN special rapporteurs on rights have also expressed &amp;ldquo;grave concerns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is, unfortunately, little chance that the government will pay any attention to the international outcry. This regressive law is likely here to stay, with far-reaching consequences for our democracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p></div>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
