    <title>How I think of arachnophobes</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/01/16/how-i-think-of-arachnophobes/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;In what I consider among the most cringeworthy videos of all time, a whole family of arachnophobes notice a small house spider on the ceiling, and &lt;em&gt;freak out&lt;/em&gt;. There is much screaming and whining and indecision by daddy chickenshit, mama chickenshit, and a couple of shrieking baby chickenshits. They should all be ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I include the video just to document how stupid these people are, but I don&amp;#8217;t recommend actually watching it &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s way too much over-the-top drama over a harmless animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re going to hate me for this, but when someone tells me they&amp;#8217;re afraid of spiders, I&amp;#8217;ll always picture these people in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s strange that anyone would have such a binary view of how women &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be. You know that it&amp;#8217;s possible to appreciate spiders without chugging beer and smashing cans on your forehead, right? And that arachnophobia isn&amp;#8217;t a parameter on the femininity spectrum? People are more complex than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who am I to talk? My vision of idealized femininity was fixed in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">Siouxsie Wiles explains the <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/opinion/130948983/when-it-comes-to-covid-a-name-can-be-important">sneaky shenanigans behind COVID PR</a>. It’s literally PR <em>for</em> the disease.</p>
<blockquote><p>In late 2020, the WHO started naming Covid-19 variants after letters of the Greek alphabet. Omicron was the letter given to the variant that emerged in late 2021.</p>
<p>Just looking at the data on the cumulative number of confirmed Covid cases worldwide, which we know is an underestimate, I think it’s pretty safe to say that Omicron has probably infected more people in the last year than caught Covid in the first two years of the pandemic put together.</p>
<p>All those Omicron infections mean the virus has also continued to evolve, but so far, the WHO hasn’t given any of the Omicron offshoots a new Greek letter. That’s why the world has been drowning in an alphabet soup of Omicron subvariants, from the BA’s and BJ’s to the BQ’s and XBB’s. I guess if we gave any one of them a new Greek letter, it would spoil the idea that the pandemic is over, and we don’t have to worry about Covid any more.</p></blockquote>
<p>You’d think the dead bodies would be a clue — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/14/china-covid-death-toll-revision/">China has revealed that they’ve had 60,000 deaths since December</a> — but no, we’re all in denial. A few people are trying to bring attention to an <em>ongoing</em> problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspired by someone on Twitter who nicknamed BA.2.75 Centaurus, last year Professor Ryan Gregory, a biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada, started compiling a list of nicknames for Omicron subvariants based on mythological creatures. Which is easier to remember? That BJ.1 and BM.1.1.1 combined to form XBB, which evolved into XBB.1, and then XBB.1.5? Or that Argus and Mimas combined to form Gryphon, which evolved into Hippogryph and then into Kraken?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s something, I guess, but I feel like tactics to draw the public’s attention to our evolving pandemic aren’t going to be effective if the public simply doesn’t care. The general citizenry is just opposed to taking <em>any</em> action to slow the spread of the disease. No one is asking much — Siouxsie explains what a common sense response would be.</p>
<blockquote><p>Am I concerned about Kraken? Regular readers will know I take all variants seriously. What concerns me more is that we are no longer working collectively to reduce the spread of Covid.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean I want us to return to the days of lockdowns. I just want us to use the tools we know to reduce the transmission of not just every variant of Covid so far, but also many other airborne infectious diseases – high-quality masks, clean air and staying home when infectious. We’ll reap the rewards in the long run.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Masks”? Tyranny!</p>

<blockquote><p>Like any other lawmaker, Rep.-elect Robert Garcia will swear his oath of office on a foundational text. He chose the US Constitution over the Bible or another religious book, and when the time comes, he’ll also take his oath with three sentimental items, including the first edition comic of <i>Superman</i>.</p>
<p>“I’ve read almost all genres, but Superman is always the character that stood out and spoke to me the most,” Garcia, a Democrat from California, told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Reporters on Tuesday spotted the vintage comic book among the items laid out in the House of Representatives in preparation of the swearing-in of newly elected members. In a tweet, Garcia, who describes himself as a comic book nerd in his Twitter bio, acknowledged it was for him. He said he will be sworn in to Congress with the Constitution as well as a photograph of his parents, who both died during the pandemic; his naturalization paperwork from when he became a US citizen; and the first edition of Superman, which he borrowed from the Library of Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m happy to see that someone chose something wholesome, rather than that archaic book of misogyny, racism, and violence. Immigrants have to stick together, too.</p>

<p class="lead">Genetics class begins this week, and I am ready for the first week. Syllabus: done. This week’s lectures: done. This week’s lab: done. I can sit back and relax and maybe go for a walk today, that bit of stress is gone.</p>
<p>Now the lab for the second week…that’s another story. That week the students are supposed to start breeding flies, and I got my fly stocks all set up in December, and I was supposed to be at the stage of expanding the colony to have a surplus in time to hand them out. Some of the lines have been duds. Wild type flies are doing fine, the <i>scarlet</i> mutants are proliferating like gangbusters, but the <i>white miniature forked</i> mutants are barely getting by, and I’m down to a handful of <i>brown</i> flies, because they keep dying off. Fresh stocks have been ordered, but I’m going to be cutting it close — every step in these crosses has to be carefully timed in order to get results that don’t conflict with those stupid interruptions in our schedule, like spring break.</p>
<p>So I’m fine this week except that I’m going to be panicking about next week. There’s always something to elevate my anxiety.</p>

    <title>Jocelyn Bell, woman of steel</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6065/jocelyn-bell-woman-of-steel#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Jocelyn Bell (Burnell), 1967" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bell12.jpeg" height="600" alt="Portrait of Jocelyn Bell (Burnell), 1967" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Chance favours the prepared mind. But it also favours the person who works twice as hard as everyone else because of a severe dose of impostor syndrome. At least, it did in the case of Jocelyn Bell. Fifty-five years ago, she discovered &amp;ldquo;pulsars&amp;rdquo;, which are the relics of stellar explosions that pack the mass of the Sun into the volume of Mount Everest and spin at up to 716 times per second.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Bell, now Dame Jocelyn Bell, is famous for being overlooked for the Nobel Prize for Physics, which went to her supervisor Anthony Hewish. She is also one of the rare scientists to have their discovery on a bank note: the Bank of Ulster &amp;pound;50 note. But her road to fame was a rocky one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Born in Lurgan, a town in Northern Ireland, Bell had an interest in science, partly because her architect father had designed the Armagh Observatory. But girls at her school were expected to study domestic science only. Thankfully, her parents kicked up an almighty fuss and the policy was changed. It might have been expected that things would be better at the University of Glasgow. But for Bell, the only physics undergraduate in her year, entering a lecture theatre was not unlike walking past a building site, with the male students stamping their feet and wolf-whistling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Radio astronomy appealed to Bell because she did not like doing astronomy at night. While at Glasgow, she had a summer job at the Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory near Manchester. It might have led to research towards a PhD had the observatory&amp;rsquo;s director Sir Bernard Lovell not taken against women. Resigned to going to Australia, an important centre of radio astronomy, she applied to Cambridge on the off-chance. To her amazement, she was accepted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;***&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Cambridge was a daunting place. Not only was Bell a woman in a male environment but she was doubly disadvantaged by coming from provincial Northern Ireland. Convinced that she been admitted because of a bureaucratic mistake, she worked long and hard in the hope it would extend the period before she was, inevitably, &amp;ldquo;found out&amp;rdquo; by the university.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;For two years, she helped build a very strange radio telescope at Lord&amp;rsquo;s Bridge, west of Cambridge. The brainchild of Hewish, it covered the area of 57 tennis courts and consisted of vertical wooden poles connected together by 120 miles of cable like myriad washing lines. It was designed to look for the recently discovered, and totally mysterious, &amp;ldquo;quasars&amp;rdquo;. However, on 28 November 1967 Bell spotted something very unexpected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The output of the telescope was recorded by a pen on a rotating cylinder of paper. It was in the course of examining this that Bell noticed a &amp;ldquo;quarter inch smudge&amp;rdquo;. Magnifying it, she was amazed to see a signal peaking every 1.3 seconds, regular as clockwork. Hewish pooh-poohed it as almost certainly being man-made radio interference. But Bell, like a dog with a bone, refused to drop the matter. Used to examining 100 feet of pen recorder trace a day, she set herself the task of re-examining three miles of chart, recorded over the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Her persistence was rewarded. She found a second source. Eventually she would find four. Given it was unlikely there were several similar man-made sources in different parts of the sky, she had proved Hewish wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The first source, for obvious reasons, had been dubbed LGM-1, for &amp;ldquo;Little Green Man - 1&amp;rdquo;. But it was astronomer Fred Hoyle who guessed that it was a &amp;ldquo;neutron star&amp;rdquo;, the super-dense relic left after a star had blown itself apart in a &amp;ldquo;supernova&amp;rdquo;. Like a spinning ice skater who pulls in her arms, the core of a star would spin ever faster as it shrank down to create a tiny neutron star. Although too faint to be seen in normal circumstances, some neutron stars sweep a lighthouse beam of radio waves across the sky as they spin, making them detectable as pulsars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Hewish, who died at the end of 2021, won the 1974 Nobel Prize, partly for the discovery of pulsars. And although three Nobel Prizes have now been awarded for pulsars, none has gone to Bell. Hewish once said that, when Columbus discovered the Americas, credit did not go to the first person who spotted land. But Bell was more than an inconsequential scientific deckhand. Having connected up every last cable of the Cambridge telescope, she knew the instrument far better than anyone else. And without her steely determination, born of all the adversity she had faced, the discovery of pulsars would not have been made at that time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marcus Chown is the author of many books on science. His most recent is &amp;ldquo;Breakthrough&amp;rdquo; (Faber &amp;amp; Faber, 2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>In a word: "mob"</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6064/in-a-word-mob#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/1024px-A_angry_mob_of_villagers_protesting_outside_the_house_of_a_d_Wellcome_V0010962.jpeg" height="720" alt="A 19th century watercolour depicts a doctor facing an angry mob." width="1024"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mob&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;late 17th century: abbreviation of mobile, short for Latin mobile vulgus &amp;ldquo;excitable crowd&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Politicians like to recycle words that stir the pot. In October, home secretary Suella Braverman did just that in her &amp;ldquo;plan for law and order&amp;rdquo; speech, when she said: &amp;ldquo;We need common sense policing. Unashamedly and unapologetically on the side of the law-abiding majority. That means that the mob needs to be stopped.&amp;rdquo; She later strung together a stream of invective: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;-reading, tofu-eating wokerati&amp;rdquo;. The two speeches together show the level of hostility she feels for specific groups of people &amp;ndash; as does the context of the word &amp;ldquo;mob&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;Before it was used to refer to a disorderly crowd, &amp;ldquo;mob&amp;rdquo; was an alternative to &amp;ldquo;mab&amp;rdquo;, meaning a &amp;ldquo;sluttish&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;promiscuous woman&amp;rdquo;. Recall Mercutio&amp;rsquo;s ironic speech about Queen Mab in &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;. By 1688, when the playwright Thomas Shadwell used the word in his play &lt;em&gt;Squire of Alsatia&lt;/em&gt;, a pun had been made by abbreviating the Latin phrase &lt;em&gt;mobile vulgus &lt;/em&gt;(the moving crowd) to &amp;ldquo;mob&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;The French Revolution inspired Edmund Burke, the historian most horrified by the turmoil in Paris, to use the word &amp;ldquo;mob&amp;rdquo; to describe events that had occurred closer to home: Britain&amp;rsquo;s Gordon Riots, which saw several days of looting and chaos in the capital, motivated by anti-Catholic sentiment. Leap forward to our own times, and the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; is writing about people facing the police in Brixton in 1981 as &amp;ldquo;the mob&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;In one syllable, &amp;ldquo;mob&amp;rdquo; reduces a group of diverse human beings into a single out-of-control mass. It dehumanises them and presumes they have no &lt;br&gt;legitimate reasons for being in the street. From a &lt;br&gt;linguistic point of view, it&amp;rsquo;s also convenient for combining with other words: mob rule, mob action, mob psychology or mob violence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;One puzzle remains in the case of Braverman. Her law and order speech went on to lambast &amp;ldquo;protestors who use guerrilla tactics and bring chaos and misery to the law-abiding majority.&amp;rdquo; But are these the same people reading the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and eating tofu? &amp;ldquo;Tofu-eating mob&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; would that be a vote-winner?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/IMG_74751.jpeg" height="959" alt="Carrie Jenkins" width="1596"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrie Jenkins is a philosopher, novelist and poet, working at the intersection of academic philosophy and the creative arts. She is a professor of philosophy at the University of British Columbia and led the Metaphysics of Love Project (2014 to 2019). Her latest book is "Sad Love: Romance and the search for meaning" (Polity).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have written that "we have a collective responsibility to figure out romantic love&amp;rdquo;. Why is this important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"&gt;We make so many life-changing decisions based on whether we&amp;rsquo;re in love &amp;ndash; decisions like whether to move across the world, get married, or have children &amp;ndash; and yet when it comes to &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; exactly we&amp;rsquo;re basing those decisions on, we&amp;rsquo;re often all too comfortable saying it&amp;rsquo;s a mysterious magical force that nobody can understand. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll know when you know,&amp;rdquo; people say, and &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t overthink it.&amp;rdquo; But this means a huge factor shaping not only our personal lives but the very fabric of society is left unexamined, and whatever harms it may be causing go unchallenged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love is such a popular topic, and so central to our lives, that it might seem bizarre that we still have to "figure it out&amp;rdquo;. But you&amp;rsquo;ve argued that the cloud of mystery around love might be purposeful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes! I call this the &amp;ldquo;romantic mystique&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the idea that we cannot understand love and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even try. My question is &lt;em&gt;who does that benefit&lt;/em&gt;? And my answer is: the people benefiting the most from the status quo continuing as it is. So we have to think about what status quo is created and sustained by our current baseline understanding of love being the way it is. We think of romantic love as (ideally) monogamous, permanent, and leading to the formation of new nuclear family units. So anyone who benefits from a society structured in this way benefits from the romantic mystique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, the romantic mystique is a force for social conservatism: it benefits the patriarchal, white supremacist, colonial, capitalist status quo. It does this by channelling love &amp;ndash; a powerful and potentially disruptive force that can lead us to form intense co-operative bonds with one another &amp;ndash; into a single structure that is easy to control. There&amp;rsquo;s a reason Margaret Thatcher once said she believed in individuals and families, but not society. Under capitalism, the nuclear family is essentially just a larger consuming unit. Whereas extended community bonds, and any form of love that may direct our focus beyond our picket fences, is risky. That kind of thing can lead to solidarity, collective action and political change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the aims of the Metaphysics of Love project and why was it important to pair philosophers with poets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had a frustration with the way philosophical discussions of love were proceeding, at least within the academic discipline of philosophy. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that those discussions weren&amp;rsquo;t fruitful and interesting in their own right, more that they felt limited. I only saw a few topics being addressed, and a relatively uniform perspective on life represented in the conversations. My questions and my perspective weren&amp;rsquo;t there, and the more I talked about it with others the more convinced I became that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one feeling that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I turned to interdisciplinary work partly in an attempt to break out of the mould: poetry struck me a natural source for the kind of insight and creative power that shakes things up. Poets are used to working at the edge of what can be said, or even beyond it. On the flip side, philosophy offers a massively powerful toolkit for digging into the theoretical and speculative aspects of those questions. So (despite what Plato said) I see a natural kinship between philosophy and poetry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These days, I draw on many different disciplines in my work. I now think of the approach not as interdisciplinary but as &lt;em&gt;undisciplined&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to straddle separate disciplines, but to challenge the very idea of separation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You've written about the &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; myth, but isn&amp;rsquo;t its power fading with every generation, as more people decide to remain unmarried and divorce rates rise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sadly, no! The myth is becoming more and more obviously unrealistic, but even as that happens its power may actually be increasing. That&amp;rsquo;s because the way the myth functions is as an &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt;, a standard against which we measure ourselves and find ourselves wanting. It&amp;rsquo;s unrealistic, but in the same way that beauty standards are: we are all meant to fall short to some degree, and then feel bad about it, and then to go out and buy something to feel (temporarily) better. My work isn&amp;rsquo;t aimed at showing the myth is unrealistic &amp;ndash; we know that already. It&amp;rsquo;s aimed at unmasking the myth as a &lt;em&gt;bad ideal to aim at in the first place&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us about your theory of how love functions both as a social construct and a biological phenomenon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, we have this ancient, evolved, biological machinery in our brains and bodies that accounts for many of our experiences of romance &amp;ndash; from the nervous adrenaline rushes, to the dopamine hits when our interest is reciprocated, to the surges of oxytocin that accompany a secure bond. But then we also have a socially constructed &lt;em&gt;script&lt;/em&gt; for a romantic relationship, where it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to proceed from an initial crush to a dating stage to sex then monogamous marriage and then kids. That&amp;rsquo;s the romantic &amp;ldquo;happy ever after&amp;rdquo; script.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My question is: how do these two things &amp;mdash;the biology and the social script &amp;ndash; fit together? And the analogy I like to use for this is an actor playing a role. A biological organism &amp;ndash; such as William Shatner &amp;ndash; can be cast in the scripted role of Captain Kirk on &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;. In the same way, we can &amp;ldquo;cast&amp;rdquo; the biological machinery of love in the role of modern romance. The interesting philosophical work, for me, is about how good that casting decision is. William Shatner does a good job as Captain Kirk. But how well does our biological love machinery fit the contemporary script for a romantic relationship? For some of us, it seems to work well (or at least, well enough). But for many of us &amp;ndash; most obviously for all the polyamorous people and the aromantic people [people with little or no romantic attraction to others] &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a poor fit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t the scripted role as such, but the idea that it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;one-size-fits-all&lt;/em&gt;. I argue for more conscious customisation and tailoring in our relationships. The more we do that kind of thing, the weaker the normative model becomes. That model can change, as many of us have seen in our lifetimes with the gradual moves towards the normalisation of same-sex romance. (When I was a teenager, the script stated &lt;em&gt;very firmly&lt;/em&gt; that romance was between a man and a woman. In that order.) The normativity of the romantic script &amp;ndash; and the policing of every &amp;ldquo;deviation&amp;rdquo; from it &amp;ndash; thrives in the darkness of the romantic mystique. The remedy is sunlight: more explicit discussion and open challenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Romantic Paradox?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This idea is based on an older idea, known as the Paradox of Happiness, which says that the pursuit of happiness is self-defeating. Philosopher J.S. Mill put it this way: &amp;ldquo;Those only are happy &amp;hellip; who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness &amp;hellip; Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way.&amp;rdquo; I also like Viktor Frankl&amp;rsquo;s catchy statement that happiness &amp;ldquo;cannot be pursued; it must ensue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My Romantic Paradox says that the same goes for the romantic &amp;ldquo;happy ever after.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re all inundated, from early childhood onwards, with the idea that we should pursue this as a (or even &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;) central component of a good life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But chasing after the romantic &amp;ldquo;happy after ever&amp;rdquo; is actually a way to end up frustrated and miserable. This can be considered a special case of the Paradox of Happiness, but the situation is exacerbated here by two factors. First, the expectations we put on romance: the higher the stakes, the greater the devastation when we &amp;ldquo;fail.&amp;rdquo; And second, the script for romance emphasises things like being a perfect fit for one&amp;rsquo;s soulmate and nothing ever changing, which make it less likely that we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to successfully navigate challenges and changes in a healthy way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your latest book, &amp;ldquo;Sad Love&amp;rdquo;, is a powerful case for embracing eudaimonic love, reflecting on its original Aristotelian meaning of &amp;ldquo;having a good guardian spirit.&amp;rdquo; How can we apply this to our lives today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The old meaning of &amp;ldquo;eudaimonic&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; even older than Aristotle &amp;ndash; comes from the roots &amp;ldquo;eu&amp;rdquo; (good) and &amp;ldquo;daimon&amp;rdquo; (spirit). I think of eudaimonia in a contemporary setting as being about good spirits in every sense. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to think of this as anything supernatural; it&amp;rsquo;s more like what&amp;rsquo;s going on when people call their &amp;ldquo;fairy godmothers&amp;rdquo; or talk about the &amp;ldquo;vibe&amp;rdquo; in a room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; daimons that can ruin our love lives, from the smallest scale &amp;ndash; like the little voices in our heads that tell us we aren&amp;rsquo;t good enough &amp;ndash; to the global &amp;ndash; like racism or homophobia. Good or bad daimons are operative at every scale in between, too: even in a globally white supremacist world, a supportive family or local community can give an interracial relationship a much better chance of thriving. When we think about romantic love, we are inclined to think of it as a private or personal thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I want to challenge this idea. Lovers are never operating in isolation, even when they build picket fences or close the bedroom door. I aim to call attention to how deeply love is affected by our interconnectedness, and depends for its very existence on supportive daimons at every scale from the tiny to the global.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoListParagraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eudaimonic love, you write, means abandoning mythology and taking on responsibility for crafting our relationships. Is this why you&amp;rsquo;ve said that existentialism is due for a come-back?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s a big part of it. Existentialism is all about the ways we create ourselves as individuals through our choices and our actions. So I&amp;rsquo;m saying that, in taking more responsibility for crafting and customising our relationships, we can move away from what existentialists would call &amp;ldquo;bad faith&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the attempted abdication of responsibility in favour of a script. We never &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; ditch our responsibilities &amp;ndash; after all, it&amp;rsquo;s we who chose to follow the script. But we can pretend to ourselves that we have no choice but to follow society&amp;rsquo;s script for (say) how a husband or a boyfriend is supposed to behave. That&amp;rsquo;s bad faith, and I want us all to come to a better sense of how much responsibility we really have for our own love lives, and for the evolution of the social scripts and norms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrie Jenkin's "Sad Love: Romance and the search for meaning" is published by Polity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: The Newlyweds</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/the-newlyweds-9781982134440_hr.jpeg" height="710" alt="The Newlyweds by Mansi Choksi" width="478"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Newlyweds (Icon) b&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;y Mansi Choksi &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;At first, reading &lt;em&gt;The Newlyweds&lt;/em&gt;, I was unsure as to the genre of the book &amp;ndash; testament, I would argue, to Mansi Choksi&amp;rsquo;s novelistic skills. It is a work of non-fiction, but written with such literary flair that you wonder whether the photos of the protagonists are a double bluff and it really is a novel after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;The book is promoted as a portrait of &amp;ldquo;love in the New India&amp;rdquo;, but many of the modern relationships are still doomed because they break centuries-old taboos on intermarriage between religions or castes and same-sex relationships. What is new is how Modi and his vigilante Hindu gangs weaponise intermarriage between Hindu women and Muslim men by framing it as &amp;ldquo;love jihad&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a disturbing twist on an old prejudice which gives ultra-nationalist activists the excuse to terrorise couples and their families today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;Also specific to the New India is the existence of an &amp;ldquo;NGO&amp;rdquo; called the Love Commandos, whose mission is to help young lovers thwarted by authoritarian parents, caste, community or religion to come together and be married. Sanjoy Sachdev, founder of the organisation, points to the first intercaste marriage between two Hindu gods, Shiva and Parvati, to give his mission a religious blessing, so that young lovers can &amp;ldquo;inherit a country where love is not a crime&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;The story of the NGO has a darkly comic twist. Sachdev, we learn, has himself never been in love, although he has had four children in an arranged marriage to a woman whose destiny it is to look after his ageing father while he gads about rescuing lovesick couples. This idealistic project is undercut with corruption. Sachdev bleeds the couples dry under one pretext or another, and once he has got his claws into those who have access to money, they are unable to escape his &amp;ldquo;shelter&amp;rdquo; easily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;The main focus of &lt;em&gt;The Newlyweds&lt;/em&gt; is on three sets of couples &amp;ndash; although other cases, including a brutal &amp;ldquo;honour&amp;rdquo; killing, also get a mention. Dhawinder and Neetu are from the same village, but one is a Sikh and one a Hindu; Monika and Arif are in a Hindu-Muslim relationship; and Preethi and Reshma are a lesbian couple. One of the most poignant moments in the book is when Reshma learns the word &amp;ldquo;lesbian&amp;rdquo;. She decides, unaware of the word&amp;rsquo;s long abusive history, that English is a great language because it contains a special word to describe her relationship with Preethi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;In the two main heterosexual relationships outlined in the book, the women&amp;rsquo;s parents and community wreak revenge on the men&amp;rsquo;s families, hounding them out of their homes and livelihoods. It would be interesting to know whether this is a common pattern; if so, it underlines the view that women are receptacles of the community&amp;rsquo;s honour and all hell must be let loose on men who sully that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;I have minor quibbles about the writing. There are some wonderful lines, like &amp;ldquo;Men with small smiles and big misconceptions about their place in the world barged into the lives of happy couples,&amp;rdquo; but these are mixed with exchanges that can feel a little on-the-nose. It is also crudely tilted towards an American audience &amp;ndash; the writer, or perhaps her editor, failing to recognise the cultural interconnectedness of the modern world with lines like &amp;ldquo;hastily sliding vegetable-filled pastries called samosas into a pan of whistling oil&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;Given the huge societal and emotional obstacles that the couples have to overcome to find happiness together, there is a deep poignancy when the relationships begin to unravel, sometimes as a result of economic and social pressures and sometimes due to incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;The author&amp;rsquo;s stated quest is to discover &amp;ldquo;if love can endure with dignity if it becomes tainted with shame&amp;rdquo;. The stories move from the societal restrictions placed on love in India to a more universal, introspective, almost unanswerable question that all the couples face to varying degrees: &amp;ldquo;Was it worth it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Meet the Milky Way</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6059/meet-the-milky-way#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="A black hole hurtles across the plane of the Milky Way" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/GRO_JI655-40_a_black_hole_hurtles_across_the_plane_of_the_Milky_Way.jpg" height="1051" alt="A black hole hurtles across the Milky Way" width="1475"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Milky Way: An Autobiography of Our Galaxy (Grand Central Publishing) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;by Moiya McTier &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Despite living inside it, a majority of people are not familiar with the galaxy we call home. In many cities, we can no longer even see the smudge of its stars spilling across the night sky. Moiya McTier, astrophysicist and folklore expert, sets out to right this situation in &lt;em&gt;The Milky Way: An Autobiography of Our Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;, introducing us all to the galaxy &amp;ndash; in its own words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an ambitious and wholly fresh take on science writing. Far more than just a nonfiction book about how space works, the &amp;ldquo;autobiography&amp;rdquo; is a narrative with a true character arc, for something so removed from human life that you might never have thought to anthropomorphise it in the first place. The Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s voice is unique and compelling, able to draw in any reader, whether or not they have prior interest in astronomy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;So, if a celestial body as mind-bogglingly expansive as the Milky Way actually talked to us, what would it say? In McTier&amp;rsquo;s world, it&amp;rsquo;s a snarky, self-righteous God-like figure. This is its opening line: &amp;ldquo;Take a look around you human. What do you see? Actually, don&amp;rsquo;t answer that. Why would I bother listening to you when I know you&amp;rsquo;ll get it wrong?&amp;rdquo; Soon after, it calls the reader a &amp;ldquo;vain, filthy animal&amp;rdquo; and our entire species &amp;ldquo;simple creatures&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;In the first few chapters, I longed for McTier&amp;rsquo;s soothing voice from the preface. The Milky Way was grating, condescending and unrelatable, constantly reminding us that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist without it. At the same time, however, I wondered if the reader would take the Milky Way seriously if it spoke and thought like a human. Our galaxy is currently a spry 13.6 billion years old. It seems natural that it might suffer from an extreme case of the Overview Effect, where &lt;br&gt;astronauts who see Earth from above reconsider our small planet&amp;rsquo;s place in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;While the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s lifetime is long, McTier tells its story in a quick-to-read 200-something pages, jam-packed with science. The Milky Way character leads us through the Big Bang and its own birth, giving us a detailed account of how galaxies are made, and also how astronomers have figured all this out. This is one of my favourite aspects of the book. The Milky Way often describes how humans came to know the stories it&amp;rsquo;s telling, and the part played by our toolkit of telescopes, from Gaia to Kepler and beyond. As an astronomer myself, I often wish that people knew more of what we astronomers actually do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;The &amp;ldquo;autobiography&amp;rdquo; goes on to tell us about our cosmic neighbourhood, known as the Local Group, introducing us to three nearby galactic pals: Larry (the Large Magellanic Cloud), Sammy (the Small Magellanic Cloud) and Trin (the Triangulum Galaxy). The Local Group has a vast zoo of different types of galaxies, from gorgeous spirals like next door Andromeda to weird, blobby irregulars. But of course, our narrator is most concerned with itself, and its distinct &amp;ldquo;body parts&amp;rdquo;. A fascinating part of the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s body is the supermassive black hole at its centre. Pretty much every big galaxy has a black hole, one of the most mysterious objects in space &amp;ndash; something so massive and dense that not even light, the fastest thing in the Universe, can escape its gravitational grip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Often in science writing, black holes are described as devouring monsters, or eldritch horrors. In McTier&amp;rsquo;s book, the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s black hole (nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Sarge&amp;rdquo;, for its scientific name Sagittarius A*) is instead described as a feeling that might be familiar to many readers: the seemingly inescapable tug of depression or negative thoughts. Sarge keeps trying to drag the Milky Way down, but the Milky Way won&amp;rsquo;t let it. For me, this felt like a turning point in my relationship with the character. The God-like galaxy reveals itself to be actually quite human, facing the challenges of what it means to be alive and feel despair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Much like humans, it also wonders about its own death, explaining &amp;ldquo;what it really means for a galaxy &amp;ndash; a massive, self-sustaining system with a disparate but coherent consciousness &amp;ndash; to die.&amp;rdquo; The death of the Milky Way is entangled with the end of the entirety of the Universe, a complicated cosmological affair. There are a few ways the Universe may meet its demise, and the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; answer is still debated by scientists. But they all have one thing in common: it&amp;rsquo;s extremely hard to explain the details of these scenarios in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms. Yet McTier does a fantastic job, managing to explain quantum fields in a way that does not scare off the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;The science communication is extremely well executed, but there is also much more to this book. McTier has a PhD in astrophysics, but she also has a Harvard degree in folklore. Interwoven with the fascinating information on astronomy, the Milky Way tells us about the names that different Earth cultures have given to it, the stories told about its constellations, and (my personal favourite) how sci-fi and other &amp;ldquo;modern myths&amp;rdquo; reveal truths in turn about humanity. &amp;ldquo;Did you think myths were just things of the past?&amp;rdquo; the Milky Way asks. &amp;ldquo;Absolutely not. Humanity makes new myths every day about the things you want to have faith in . . . At their core, myths are stories that you capital B believe in, even if you know some (or all) of it to be false.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, this cosmological &amp;ldquo;autobiography&amp;rdquo; is a deeply human book, exploring the intersections between myth and science while teaching the reader about our galaxy, the scientific process and more. We learn that the Milky Way does have a soft spot for humans, the weird and seemingly unique creatures that we are. And in the end, it even becomes a likeable pal: a friend watching over us from the skies, encouraging us to take care of each other and marvel in the discoveries our astronomers make. &amp;ldquo;Ask questions about the world around you and find real answers to them,&amp;rdquo; the galaxy instructs. &amp;ldquo;Decide you deserve better and fight to clean your sky of all kinds of pollution &amp;ndash; trust me, I&amp;rsquo;m worth it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2022/04/26/the-results-are-in/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
