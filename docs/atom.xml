    <title>I always wondered how you can be a university president &amp; on the board of pharmaceutical companies &amp; run a gigantic research lab</title>

<p class="lead">I know that guy! That’s Marc Tessier-Lavigne! He’s about my age, and we shared similar interests — we were both interested in axon guidance, and I followed his work avidly some years ago. He was publishing about netrins, signaling molecules that affect the trajectory of growing neurons, while I was studying growing neurons in grasshopper embryos. I met him several times, I attended talks he gave at various meetings, it was hard to avoid Tessier-Lavigne.</p>
<p>Our careers followed very different paths, though. I ended up teaching at a small liberal arts college, while he got a position at UCSF, and then was CSO at Genentech, and then was president of Rockefeller University, was on the boards of various pharmaceutical companies, and finally was president of Stanford University. He was a major go-getter, running gigantic factory-style labs, getting regularly published in <i>Science</i> and <i>Nature</i> and <i>Cell</i>. It was a life that looked horrible to me, just as my life of obscurity and teaching would have looked horrible to him, if ever he had deigned to notice me.</p>
<p>Why would I have disliked the prestigious path he took in science? Because he turned himself into a manager, a guy who was disconnected from the science that was being done in his massively well-funded labs. Ick. I’d rather play at the bench and help students get enthusiastic about doing science.</p>
<p>I may have chosen wisely, because now <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/stanford-university-president-marc-tessier-lavigne-announces-resignati-rcna95141">Tessier-Lavigne has been compelled to resign as an investigation found evidence of fraud in his work</a>. Yikes. This is bad.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Board of Trustees’ inquiry stopped short of accusing Tessier-Lavigne — who has been Stanford’s president since 2016 — of fraud, saying there’s no evidence he “personally engaged in research misconduct.”</p>
<p>However, it was concluded that five papers on which Tessier-Lavigne was a principal author included work from “some members of labs overseen by Dr. Tessier-Lavigne” who had “either engaged in inappropriate manipulation of research data or engaged in deficient scientific practices, resulting in significant flaws in those papers.”</p>
<p>When the issues emerged, “Tessier-Lavigne took insufficient steps to correct mistakes in the scientific record,” the board’s report said.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what happens when you become an over-worked administrator with your fingers in too many pies. That does not excuse him — he has his name on so many papers, and getting an authorship entails significant responsibilities — and it just tells you the kind of peril ambition can put you in.</p>
<p>I’ve been teaching about netrins and robo and neuropilins and all these molecules in neurodevelopment for years. Am I going to have to put an asterisk by the source papers and review their validity now? I’m hoping the descent into sloppiness was a late-career problem that doesn’t call into question all the fundamental stuff he did.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;New movie marketers decided to use the Greek alphabet in their poster, and caused my brain to stutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/sordt-d.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/sordt-d.jpeg" alt="" width="481" height="680" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70776" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/sordt-d.jpeg 481w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/sordt-d-106x150.jpeg 106w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/sordt-d-212x300.jpeg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &amp;#8220;C&amp;#8221; in the Greek alphabet; they should have substituted a &amp;Kappa;, kappa. No &amp;#8220;L&amp;#8221;, but there is a lambda, &amp;Lambda;. We get a sigma instead of an &amp;#8220;e&amp;#8221;, which is pronounced like an &amp;#8220;s&amp;#8221;. Then an omicron, so that part is OK. P is rho, it is pronounced like an &amp;#8220;r&amp;#8221;. Greek has a perfectly good, familiar letter A, alpha, but they put a delta, &amp;Delta;, in there. That&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221;. Then a tau, &amp;Tau;, which is a fine &amp;#8220;T&amp;#8221;, and an &amp;#8220;R&amp;#8221; character which doesn&amp;#8217;t exist and should be a &amp;Rho;. Then it ends with another &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that whole gemisch is pronounced &amp;#8220;??sordt?d,&amp;#8221; somehow, and I now have no confidence in the historicity of whatever this movie is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they plan to distribute this movie in Greece with that poster?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Progress in embryo analysis!</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Our new development in spider development is pretty basic stuff. We’re dechorionating embryos! That is, stripping off a thin membrane surrounding the embryo, so we can do staining and fixation and various other things. It’s a standard invertebrate technique — it turns out you can remove it by just washing them in bleach. Look, it works! This is a <i>Parasteatoda</i> embryo.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/dechorionated-embryo.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/dechorionated-embryo-500x529.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="529" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70773" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/dechorionated-embryo-500x529.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/dechorionated-embryo-142x150.jpeg 142w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/dechorionated-embryo-284x300.jpeg 284w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/dechorionated-embryo-768x812.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a></p>
<p>We’re still tinkering with the timing of the treatment. Five minutes is way too long, which basically dissolved the whole embryo. All it takes is a brief wash to break the chorion down. We’re also working out methods for manipulating them — they’re tiny! Just pipetting them into a solution is a great way to lose them. We’re now using a cut off microfuge tube to make a cylinder that we cap with a sheet of fine nylon mesh, to lower them into the solution. Of course, then we have to separate the embryos from the mesh. Fortunately, we opened up one egg sac and 140 embryos rolled out, so we have lots of material to experiment on.</p>
<p>The next question is whether they survive our abuse. We’ve got some of them sitting under a microscope, time-lapsing their response. We’ll see if they grow…or die and fall apart.</p>

    <title>Ending the legacies!</title>

<p class="lead">Conservatives cheered the Supreme Court decision to eliminate consideration of race in university admissions. I have to wonder if they’ll be so happy about this <a href="https://www.startribune.com/university-of-minnesotas-twin-cities-campus-will-stop-considering-race-legacy-ties-in-admissions/600290600/">other change at the University of Minnesota</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Admissions officers working on the U’s Twin Cities campus, which typically enrolls about 55,000 students, say they have long used a “holistic review” process that places the greatest weight on an applicant’s academic track record. But it also allowed them to report 10 additional attributes that were sometimes used to distinguish between otherwise similar candidates.</p>
<p>The university announced late last week that it would stop considering an applicant’s race, ethnicity or ties to U alumni or faculty — though it would still ask “for this optional information for recruitment and communication purposes about programs and services offered.”</p>
<p>Undergraduate student government leaders said Tuesday that they welcomed the effort to eliminate legacy admissions, noting some other colleges had already done so. But they wanted to know more about the plan to stop considering race and ethnicity, saying they believe it’s crucial to have a diverse campus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh god yes. End the legacy admissions. If you’re going to eliminate biases in admissions, the first place you should start is ending the privileges that give preferential status to children of alumni. The only reason to benefit them is the hope that alumni will give them more money.</p>
<p>I don’t think Republican businesspeople and professionals realized how much of an advantage they’ve had, and now it’s going to be gone (optimistically — I don’t believe someone who donates money for a building on campus is going to find their kids rejected, not matter how unqualified they are. After all, our appointed <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/09/i-predicted-this/">interim president brings nothing to the school except his affiliation with Hormel</a>.)</p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see how this works out.</p>

    <title>Gosh, I sure hope Marjorie Taylor Greene keeps working for the Biden campaign</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/07/19/gosh-i-sure-hope-marjorie-taylor-greene-keeps-working-for-the-biden-campaign/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/MJT-at-TPUSA.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/MJT-at-TPUSA-143x150.png" alt="" width="143" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-70766" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/MJT-at-TPUSA-143x150.png 143w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/MJT-at-TPUSA-287x300.png 287w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/MJT-at-TPUSA.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 143px) 100vw, 143px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class='lead'&gt;I worried that this ad by Joe Biden that quotes Marjorie Taylor Greene saying favorable things about him was a quote mine. I&amp;#8217;m so used to creationists pulling out short quotes that mean something completely different from what the author intended that I was afraid the Democrats might be pulling the same dishonest stunt, because we know she hates him. But MTG words do make &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1681424737384435713"&gt;a pretty good campaign ad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I approve this message. &lt;a href="https://t.co/f1q5giNM8j"&gt;pic.twitter.com/f1q5giNM8j&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1681424737384435713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I looked a little deeper. She actually said those things in a speech to TPUSA; she actually thought these things are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; for the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Joe Biden had the largest public investment in social infrastructure and environmental programs,&amp;#8221; Greene says in the ad, while images of the president smiling in various locations are shown as upbeat music plays. &amp;#8220;That is actually finishing what FDR started, that LBJ expanded on and Joe Biden is attempting to complete.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Programs to address education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, transportation, Medicare, Medicaid. And he is still working on it,&amp;#8221; she continues just before a Biden/Harris campaign logo appears on screen to end the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF? &amp;#8220;education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, transportation, Medicare, Medicaid&amp;#8221; are unpopular, awful programs for a president to promote, so she seeks to saddle him with that? FDR was one of our greatest presidents, and that&amp;#8217;s a comparison she wants to make? That&amp;#8217;s nuts, but it&amp;#8217;s actually what she thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinching it, &lt;a href="https://crooksandliars.com/2023/07/marjorie-taylor-greene-highlights-wonders"&gt;MJT posted a response to Biden&amp;#8217;s ad&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;#8217;s a different excerpt from her TPUSA speech, filling in the gaps in Biden&amp;#8217;s thoroughly edited version. What she was trying to communicate, poorly, was that Biden is a big fat socialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson is very similar to Joe Biden. How are they the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re both Democrat Socialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson was the majority leader in the Senate. Does that sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was Vice President to Kennedy. Joe was Vice President to Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was appointed as the president after JFK was assassinated, then he was elected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His big socialist programs were the Great Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Society were big government programs to address education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, transportation, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, and welfare, the Office of Economic Opportunity, and big labor and labor unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, LBJ had the Great Society, but Joe Biden had Build Back Better, and he still is working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest public investment in social infrastructure and environmental programs that is actually finishing what FDR started that LBJ expanded on, and Joe Biden is attempting to complete, socialism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden is not a socialist, not even a Democrat Socialist. He is not trying to &lt;q&gt;complete socialism&lt;/q&gt;, whatever that means. If the Great Society programs were socialism, then hooray for socialism, give us more of that, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, MTG was trying to put down Biden by chanting &lt;q&gt;socialism, socialism, socialism&lt;/q&gt; at him, but by spelling out what socialism means to her, she&amp;#8217;s basically educating everyone on what a good thing socialism can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention, Biden. Greene is actually telling you what works.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In a word: Kangaroo court</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6138/in-a-word-kangaroo-court#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Credit: Arun Clarke/Unsplash" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/kangaroo-arun-clarke-U-Wyetri5e4-unsplash-sq.jpg" height="1368" alt="Two kangaroos fighting" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kangaroo court&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; 19th century: an illegal court that punishes people unfairly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is happy with the investigation into whether Boris Johnson misled parliament over whether he broke Covid rules. Some allies of the former Prime Minister have dubbed the process a &amp;ldquo;kangaroo court&amp;rdquo;, a description that suggests that the committee in charge might be improvised, illegitimate or corrupt. The committee members are not amused.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The earliest written sources of the phrase &amp;ldquo;kangaroo court&amp;rdquo; are American &amp;ndash; not Australian, as you might expect. A 1841 article in the &lt;em&gt;Daily Picayune&lt;/em&gt; from New Orleans quoted another journal reporting lynchings &amp;ldquo;on charges of the Kangaroo Court&amp;rdquo;. This may, however, be a result of the presence of Australian miners in America. Why Kangaroo Courts? Perhaps because they were the ones that dealt with &amp;ldquo;claim-jumping&amp;rdquo; (when someone tries to take over someone else&amp;rsquo;s mining area). Others looking for the metaphor in the phrase have suggested that the court itself was &amp;ldquo;jumped up&amp;rdquo;, or that the improvised system of justice proceeded by leaps and bounds. Or even that the process was in the &amp;ldquo;pouch&amp;rdquo; of the accuser. The origins of oral phrases are frequently elusive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And what of the word &amp;ldquo;kangaroo&amp;rdquo; itself? The &lt;em&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; cites Captain Cook&amp;rsquo;s journal from 1770: &amp;ldquo;The animals which I have before mentioned, called by the Natives Kangooroo or Kanguru.&amp;rdquo; The &amp;ldquo;natives&amp;rdquo; he refers to here were the Aboriginal people at what colonialists called Endeavour River, Queensland. This claim was then rubbished, replaced by a widely held belief that the word means &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand&amp;rdquo;, given as an answer to Cook and his crew&amp;rsquo;s attempts to speak English to the Indigenous people. Linguistic fieldwork, however, has since confirmed the existence of a word &amp;ldquo;gangurru&amp;rdquo; in the northeast Aboriginal language of Guugu Yimidhirr, referring to a species of kangaroo. So it may be that Cook was not so wrong after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather as with Mr Johnson&amp;rsquo;s notion of truth, the origins of both &amp;ldquo;kangaroo court&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;kangaroo&amp;rdquo; are not so easy to pin down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Call me maybe</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistPhones-lowres.jpg" height="1928" alt="An illustration shows a smart phone next to a dumb phone with conversation spilling out of them" width="1500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My friend Vera likes to send me voice notes. Each one arrives with the innocent ping of an ordinary WhatsApp message. A Trojan Horse, ready to unload its hidden cargo the moment I open it. When I do so, Vera&amp;rsquo;s thoughts tumble out of my phone in a cascade of half-sentences and tangents, an improvised monologue composed entirely for me, wrapped in the background hum of the busy street she is currently walking along. I love these messages and I hate them in roughly equal measure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, WhatsApp announced that users of the messaging app send an average of 7 billion voice notes every single day. The internet is awash with articles proclaiming that the era of the voice note has arrived. &amp;ldquo;How voice memos became the new texts,&amp;rdquo; explained Australia&amp;rsquo;s ABC news in March last year, &amp;ldquo;Third of Gen Z now prefer VOICE NOTES to texts,&amp;rdquo; bellowed MailOnline in October, &amp;ldquo;The hot new thing in tech: speaking into your phone,&amp;rdquo; snarked CNN in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet, for every article proclaiming the brilliance of this new medium, there is another explaining why it should be made immediately extinct. Recent polling by YouGov reflects this unease. Of nearly 2,000 smartphone users, they found that only 16 per cent liked sending voice notes, whilst 36 per cent disliked it. Even among Gen Z, the supposed epicentre of the current voice message boom, half of those polled still said they dislike sending them, compared to 30 per cent who do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How to make sense of our ambivalent feelings towards this nascent phenomenon? For all its much heralded newness, the voice note essentially combines the functionality of two relatively old pieces of telephone technology: the text message (invented in 1992) and the answerphone (invented in 1949). A voice note is a recorded message, like the kind we used to leave on each other&amp;rsquo;s answerphones but now rarely do. Whereas those earlier messages were usually intended as a prelude to a phone conversation, a voice note is the conversation &amp;ndash; like a series of text messages, but burnished with that most tantalising of things, the human voice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Talk with electricity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is no surprise to me that our voices are reinscribing themselves in the ways we choose to communicate with one another. After all, the telephone remains, I believe, one of the great wonders of the modern age &amp;ndash; a device that brings people closer together at the same time as reminding them how far apart they are. Like something from a fairy tale, a telephone call is a granted wish that withholds as much as it gives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As is usually the case in a good fairy tale, the result is happiness forestalled. But then the telephone has always been associated with a kind of longing &amp;ndash; for human contact, if not intimacy. The very first words spoken down a telephone line (by Alexander Graham Bell to his assistant in the neighbouring room) were &amp;ldquo;Mr Watson &amp;ndash; come here &amp;ndash; I want to see you.&amp;rdquo; How many people in the 150 years since then have cried forlornly into their telephone, wishing they could see or touch or be with the person on the other end of the line?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, the intimation of this distance can give a telephone call a closeness that cannot be experienced in any other way. Bell called his invention &amp;ldquo;talk with electricity&amp;rdquo; and anyone who has stayed up too late talking on the phone would surely agree with him. An exchange of love letters might be romantic, but only the telephone really embodies all of love&amp;rsquo;s fervour and its anxiety, all its awkwardness. The headset cradled against your ear. The feeling of being very vulnerable and very excited at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet, by the time the 21st century was in full swing, this wondrous device appeared to be in terminal decline. Who or what killed the telephone call? Was it Drew Barrymore, crying into the phone in terror in the 1996 blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt;, and the deluge of prank calls that followed? Are Apple and Samsung to blame? The first smartphone could be bought in 1994, but only later were these handsets designed primarily as devices for watching, reading, touching and taking photographs, rather than talking. Smartphones today are not actually that convenient for making phone calls, and certainly not as pleasant as a traditional landline phone to hold to your ear for long periods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Quality of connection&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing in the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; in 2015, Ian Bogost claimed that the cause for the decline in telephone calls was the quality of connection. The shift from landlines to mobile phones required the transition from a stable and dependable network of wires to a cellular one that bounced calls erratically through the ether. And whereas a landline compels us to remain indoors, mobile phones enable us to be out in the world where interferences, sonic or otherwise, are manifold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But of course, talking on the phone whilst walking down the street was precisely the thing that made mobile phones so appealing. Suddenly, you could talk on the train, in the park, on a bad date &amp;ndash; even at the movies, as long as you didn&amp;rsquo;t mind the dirty looks. But such pursuit of ease and efficiency is never-ending. More than this, texts and emails enable the author (and the recipient) to retain a greater degree of control over their interaction. What SMS began, internet messaging services like WhatsApp have accelerated. In 2022, roughly 100 billion WhatsApp messages were sent every single day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The voice note might be thought of, then, as a reflection of all we have lost as we drifted away from the phone call. Whilst retaining comfort and convenience, they inject a new kind of intimacy &amp;ndash; something a little more human than a winky face emoji. As with a telephone call, we are speaking with no social cues to guide or reassure us, and none of the shared distractions that cushion our face-to-face conversations &amp;ndash; a coffee to stir, a window to look out of. We cannot compensate for nerves with energy or affection, or try to gauge the mood of the person sitting opposite. There is only our voice. Everything else is stripped away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is lost, however, is spontaneity. In the vacuum of a telephone call, you are required to improvise. You cannot spend hours, or even days, preparing exactly the right wording. A conversation on the telephone can feel like a high-wire act with the safety net removed. And yet we do it together, reaching out our hands and guiding each other through the darkness &amp;ndash; the awkward pauses, the misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Voice notes retain all the potential for misunderstanding and disconnection, but without the shared space to figure our way through. There is too much room to hide, or simply disappear. A telephone call asks something different of us; something we often think we hate, but perhaps we also need. It asks that we keep going &amp;ndash; improvising, listening and being listened to &amp;ndash; until we both know the conversation is over and, with a click, or simply a silence, the line can finally go dead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an edited extract from Andy Field&amp;rsquo;s new book &amp;ldquo;Encounterism&amp;rdquo; (September Publishing), from the summer 2023 issue of New Humanist. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Wooden shamanic totems in Siberia. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/shamanism-sq.jpg" height="1368" alt="Wooden shamanic totem poles in Siberia" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rhonda McCrimmon, from Dundee, has 180,000 TikTok followers. Some of them are doctors, others are teachers, lecturers or social workers. They are all looking for spiritual guidance. McCrimmon is a self-styled Shaman, and posts videos on connecting with spirit guides, power animals and cauldron healing. &amp;ldquo;One of the beautiful things about Shamanism is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from anywhere,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;It just is, and has existed for as long as anybody knows. It is not exclusive to one culture or ethnicity.&amp;rdquo; She is popular, with more than 1.5 million TikTok likes, and expensive too &amp;ndash; charging clients &amp;pound;3,500 for Shamanic practitioner courses lasting 20 months. Yet a growing body of opinion would question whether she knows what she is talking about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Shamanism has drawn attention, attracting celebrity followers including Jennifer Lawrence and Daniel Craig. In November, Princess Martha of Norway quit royal duties to focus on a Shamanic healing business with her Shaman fianc&amp;eacute;. And this interest is set to increase, if the 2021 UK census is a benchmark. It showed that over the past decade, there has been a 12-fold increase in British people stating their religion as Shamanism, from 650 in 2011 to 8,000 in 2021. Notably, this did not involve ticking a box, but writing their religion into a free-text space. Other nature-based religions also grew, but did not get the same traction. Paganism, which has European roots, increased its adherents by a quarter. The number of Wiccans grew by nearly 8 per cent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behind the headlines, however, Shamanism&amp;rsquo;s complex origins are surprising and rarely understood. Dr Susannah Crockford is a senior lecturer in anthropology at the University of Exeter. She says that the word &amp;ldquo;Shaman&amp;rdquo; originated with the Tungusic people of Siberia and referred to that community&amp;rsquo;s Indigenous spiritual practitioners. When the Russian conquest of Siberia occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries, Europeans returned to their homelands with stories of Shamans. &amp;ldquo;But in a very racist fashion, they laughed at them,&amp;rdquo; says Crockford. &amp;ldquo;The image of the Shaman became known in European literary circles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the 20th century, and European anthropologists were observing and writing about other cultures. On seeing Indigenous spiritual practitioners in other parts of the world, they labelled them all &amp;ldquo;Shamans&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;They used this word to describe spiritual practitioners across North America, South America and south-east Asia,&amp;rdquo; Crockford says. &amp;ldquo;None of these people used the word Shaman themselves, it was a colonial imposition on global practices that had Indigenous names. That is why you will find a broad diversity of practices under this label &amp;lsquo;Shamanism&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The bibles of western Shamanism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For western Shamans, Indigenous spiritual practices from around the world have been conveniently &amp;ndash; and questionably &amp;ndash; condensed into two books that serve as the bibles for their beliefs. In 1964, the Romanian historian Mircea Eliade published Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy. Differing Indigenous spiritual practices were merged in this book, yet it developed a following in 1960s America. It was another book, however, which became the blueprint for Shamanic practice in western societies. In 1980, the American anthropologist Michael Harner published The Way of the Shaman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Harner translated the Indigenous religions as he understood them, and then mashed them together,&amp;rdquo; says James L. Cox, emeritus professor of religions at the University of Edinburgh, who has a specialist research interest in Indigenous religions. &amp;ldquo;Harner turned Indigenous practices &amp;ndash; which tended to be about solving community problems, for example, a lack of rain or another person&amp;rsquo;s illness &amp;ndash; into an individualistic practice. In this western 1980s version of Shamanism, you could go to a weekend workshop and discuss your personal problems . . . It is a form of modern therapy where you discuss yourself in a group.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harner describes &amp;ldquo;trance&amp;rdquo; as key to unlocking the insights of western Shamanism. In this altered state, the individual is alert but experiences ecstasy through drumming, rattling, dancing and singing &amp;ldquo;power songs&amp;rdquo;. Later on in the book, readers are guided to communicate with rocks to solve their life problems: by picking up a big stone, asking it a question, and then watching it for visions. According to Harner Shamans in the west can also find their personal &amp;ldquo;power animal&amp;rdquo; by shaking a rattle and dancing like an animal of their choice. He writes that Shamans should &amp;ldquo;experience the emotions of the animal, and don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to make the cries or noises of it, if you experience the desire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book relies heavily on detailing the practices of North American and Amazonian tribes. In the opening, Harner recognises this, but adds that those who follow the techniques will not be simply &amp;ldquo;playing Indian&amp;rdquo;, but having the same &amp;ldquo;revelatory&amp;rdquo; experience, based on &amp;ldquo;methods learnt from South and North American Indians&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shannon O&amp;rsquo;Loughlin is a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, in the United States, and CEO of the Association on American Indian Affairs. &amp;ldquo;Shamanism itself is a colonial word. It is a misrepresentation and appropriation of Indigenous world views,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;The taking of Native ceremonies and using them for commercial or ego-driven practices is harmful to Native Nations, and to those non-Native persons using them without consent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Power animals and lunar energies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Karen Ward disagrees that her Shamanic practice culturally appropriates. She is a doctor of philosophy at Dublin City University, a psychotherapist, and identifies as an Irish Celtic Shaman. &amp;ldquo;If you can trace your lineage to something then you&amp;rsquo;re not appropriating,&amp;rdquo; she says, adding that &amp;ldquo;people should namecheck the traditions they use&amp;rdquo; in order to acknowledge their origins. &amp;ldquo;For me, Celtic Shamanism can be practised by going to Stonehenge on winter solstice, working with lunar energies, or by sitting in a circle &amp;ndash; where there is no priest or hierarchy &amp;ndash; and connecting with each other, and really listening to one another, giving another person in my circle that time. My ancestors would have done these things, I can trace my lineage back to all these traditions and not appropriate other cultures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there is little evidence of such ancient European practices, according to both Professor Cox and Dr Crockford. &amp;ldquo;People will call themselves Celtic Shamans,&amp;rdquo; says Crockford. &amp;ldquo;But it is very sketchy archaeologically and historically. We do not know that Druids existed, let alone their spiritual beliefs. So to reconstruct this as an ancient religion is an imaginative process. A lot of the practices that you will find in Celtic Shaman circles are strikingly like those detailed in Eliade and Harner&amp;rsquo;s books.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crockford notes that spirituality has taken off on social media. WitchTok is a spiritual community on TikTok that has received billions of views. &amp;ldquo;Just look at WitchTok,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Combined with the celebrity influence, it has become trendy. Those charging for Shamanism courses are like influencers. They are on the same channels &amp;ndash; YouTube, Instagram, TikTok. They will get money from ad revenue, and sell spiritual readings over Zoom and Facebook groups. Look at who takes these [courses] and who is making money, though. You cannot help but notice, it is usually white, English-speaking, middle- or upper-class people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Loughlin adds that name-checking is not enough. &amp;ldquo;Simply naming, &amp;lsquo;I have stolen this from Native Peoples&amp;rsquo; does not resolve or mitigate the harm,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Alleged traditional teachings from books, websites or from non-Native Peoples are simply not authentic. The value of these ceremonies is questionable and meaningless. Instead of practising &amp;lsquo;Shamanism&amp;rsquo;, start living minimally. Respect, and stop appropriating &amp;ndash; especially for profit &amp;ndash; from other cultures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Life is Hard by Kieran Setiya</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6139/book-review-life-is-hard-by-kieran-setiya#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/life-is-hard.jpg" height="499" alt="The cover of 'Life is Hard' has an illustration of a hummingbird and a thistle" width="312"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life is Hard: How Philosophy Can Help Us Find Our Way&lt;/strong&gt; (Hutchinson Heinemann) by Kieran Setiya&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kieran Setiya is an accomplished analytic philosopher and, increasingly, one of the finest public philosophers working today. His latest book, &lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt;, was written during the pandemic and its title certainly captures the present mood. But Setiya doesn&amp;rsquo;t just mean that life is hard now. After all, haven&amp;rsquo;t infirmity, grief and injustice always been with us, and won&amp;rsquo;t they remain so? Setiya&amp;rsquo;s focus is on the core features of life that make it seemingly inevitably hard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is a rich and rewarding read, reckoning with everything from personal failure to the meaning of life. The philosophy is fed by examples from Setiya&amp;rsquo;s life: his teenage heartbreak, the onset in his twenties of chronic and excruciating pelvic pain, his mother&amp;rsquo;s Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease, his involvement in climate activism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setiya is surely right that there are hardships that almost all lives will face, sooner or later; such is the human condition. His aim is to help us in &amp;ldquo;making the best of a bad lot&amp;rdquo;. He examines the ingredients that make life hard one by one, but what emerges is a view of life as a whole: humanistic, rooted in our social nature, and notably influenced by the novelist and philosopher Iris Murdoch. And if you have a stereotype of the philosophy professor as coldly rationalistic, then the centrality that Setiya gives to love might surprise you. &amp;ldquo;We are made for love,&amp;rdquo; he writes, &amp;ldquo;and we are lost without it.&amp;rdquo; Personally, I most often found his remarks to be moving and true. Some, perhaps, might find the book overly sentimental.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt; reveals the benefits of bringing careful analysis to the problems of life, but it also shows that this kind of philosophy calls for emotional intelligence. What it offers, ultimately, is consolation by acknowledgement. Setiya doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to magic away the problem of grief, for example, as the Stoic philosopher Epictetus did. Rather, he gives us words to understand our grief better, and so perhaps helps us live with the reality of love and loss. He supports this perspective throughout with a wonderful diversity of sources from literature, social science, psychology and history &amp;ndash; from the Bhagavad Gita to Gerrard Winstanley to Annie Ernaux.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discussion of failure is particularly illuminating. Setiya seeks to demonstrate how philosophy can liberate us, by showing that it&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to think of our lives in terms of one big narrative, at the end of which we&amp;rsquo;re either &amp;ldquo;winners&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;losers&amp;rdquo;. He also highlights the social forces that encourage us to think this way. Indeed, he shows how we must move beyond the logic of the self-help genre, by insisting on the social source of our problems and, where possible, their social remedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is why Setiya looks outward as well as inward, in part because when you look inward what you discover is how the world out there has made you. Perhaps the book&amp;rsquo;s vision is most inspiring and ambitious when he argues that the meaning of life itself is ultimately a political issue. &lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt; makes a compelling case that whether human life is meaningful depends on whether we give it meaning by collectively striving towards justice for humanity as a whole. Here, unlike in the case of our individual life stories, Setiya encourages us to think of the human story in terms of a grand narrative. He acknowledges the similarities with those great German philosophers Hegel and Marx, but unlike them he doesn&amp;rsquo;t see any historical destination as inevitable. It all depends on whether we get our act together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt; is a weighty and satisfying book. Some people might find it a little too earnest, even with Setiya&amp;rsquo;s likeable sense of humour. The seriousness feels so mandatory that it is tempting to rebel against it. Life is hard, the title tells us, and Setiya offers no superficial escapes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How neo-Nazis are radicalising gamers</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6137/how-neo-nazis-are-radicalising-gamers#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Graphics from 'Assassin's Creed: Valhalla'" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/valhalla.jpg" height="540" alt="A graphic from Assassin's Creed: Valhalla shows a Viking-esque warrior walking through a battlefield carrying an axe" width="960"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might seem contradictory that the most hateful viewpoints are often coupled with a yearning for a return to a romantic, idyllic past. In order for any political movement to survive, its leaders have to tell stories about how they think the world should be. On the far right, it usually goes as follows: our lands were once places of unspoiled, awe-inspiring natural beauty. People lived materially tough but spiritually enriching lives, graced with pristine, entirely white, nuclear families, green spaces and physical and psychological strength. The only thing they had to do to protect their way of life was to defend themselves &amp;ndash; unfailingly, violently &amp;ndash; against outsiders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if there isn&amp;rsquo;t a period of history that backs up that narrative, you can just invent one. A prime example of this is the far right&amp;rsquo;s celebration of the Vikings &amp;ndash; inaccurately re-envisioned as a singular white race built on glory and bloodshed, with a visually striking and fearsome aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Nazi party repeatedly adopted Viking and Nordic symbols to craft a fantasy of the Aryan race; the swastika is based on an ancient, Nordic artefact. As alt-right politics rose to the surface of party politics following the election of Donald Trump to the presidency, Norse-age symbols and &amp;ldquo;alt-history&amp;rdquo; also began to reappear. A year later, at the Unite the Right Rally, organised by Richard Spencer, protestors could be seen carrying Thor&amp;rsquo;s hammer as they marched through the streets of Charlottesville &amp;ndash; an event that led to the murder of Heather Heyer, after a participant deliberately drove their car into a crowd of counter-protestors. The Viking helmets seen in the Capitol riots in 2021 were also part of the far right&amp;rsquo;s perversion of Norse folklore and paganism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around this time, extremism researchers were also becoming concerned with the gaming community, which seemed to be increasingly overrun by violent, extremist imagery and propaganda. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t incidental. When the former Trump strategist Steve Bannon took over US far-right outlet Breitbart, he used his position to encourage Gamergate: an organised, misogynistic online harassment campaign directed against feminist gamers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recent research from the Global Network of Extremism and Technology (GNET) looks at the weaponisation by the far right of two video games in particular: &lt;em&gt;Assassins Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;. Both are based on an alt-history in which gamers can play out their white supremacist fantasies. &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is rooted in Greek and Norse mythology and has been frequently criticised for graphic scenes of violence and portrayals of toxic masculinity. Artwork from &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; has also been adopted by recognised white supremacist groups and shared online. The study shows how these hyper-real, reconstructed versions of history were adopted by fascists and scattered across the digital space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even before the release of &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed [Valhalla]&lt;/em&gt;, the game&amp;rsquo;s developers knew it would be used by white supremacists. There was a tonne of pre-warning press saying that they were trying to avoid the game being manipulated by Nazis. The argument you could make, though, is that they have still created this extremely sensationalised version of Vikings which isn&amp;rsquo;t accurate,&amp;rdquo; Dr Ashton Kingdon, a teaching fellow in criminology at the University of Southampton, who authored the report, tells me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Historical fantasies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; was launched in 2020 as the 12th instalment of the Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed series. It had the biggest launch to date, selling most of its copy within its first week. It is games developer Ubisoft&amp;rsquo;s second most profitable venture, gaining over $1 billion in revenue in 2022. Santa Monica Studio&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is a franchise that was originally based on Greek mythology. However, with its 2018 series, the developers decided to incorporate Norse mythology. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to overestimate the popularity of both games. Despite &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s mixed reviews, the game built up a fan base of 20 million players in just two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story of &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; centres on Eivor, whom the player can cast as male or female, and their brother Sigurd. It&amp;rsquo;s 873 CE. The siblings&amp;rsquo; backstory is told at the start of the game, over speeding visuals of a luminous, misty forest, as they recount witnessing their parents&amp;rsquo; murder before their eyes. From there, they take to England &amp;ndash; a land already populated with Danes and Norse after years of battle. The task is to gather allies and recruit new soldiers to defend the &amp;ldquo;homeland&amp;rdquo; against England&amp;rsquo;s begrudged four kingdoms: Mercia, East Anglia, Northumbria and Wessex. Players siege castles, set thatched huts alight and generally raid and massacre their way to glory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an immersive, cinematic game, full of expansive scenes of rolling green hills in Dark Age England. You can also wander through the mountainous terrains of Vinland, an area first discovered by Leif Erikson in 1000 CE, five centuries before Columbus. It&amp;rsquo;s not all killing and pillaging, either. The game throws you into some emotionally testing scenarios. You find yourself ushered into making swift, life-ending decisions over suspected traitors, or unearthing the motivations behind a man who is haunted by the spirit of his dead wife. For some relief, you can sing songs or partake in a drinking game or two.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The attention to detail and artistry are impressive, and the romanticisation might not seem immediately harmful. But when it falls into the wrong hands, an intricate, highly realistic rendition of Viking mythology sends a worrying message. One of the main gripes for historians is the overarching use of the term &amp;ldquo;Viking&amp;rdquo; itself. The idea of the blue-eyed, blonde-haired warrior conquering Europe just isn&amp;rsquo;t true. Viking, Kingdon explains, is actually a verb, alluding to the group&amp;rsquo;s activities. The seafarers settled across the Mediterranean, Caspian, Black, Arctic and North Atlantic seas. They could be distinguishable from Celts or Saxons not because of their ethnicity, but because of their skill in sailing. It was only in the 19th century, when Europe was becoming increasingly nationalistic, that the myth that the Vikings were a superior race &amp;ndash; descended from a genetically pure bloodline &amp;ndash; began to take hold of the popular psyche.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The imaginary locations shown in &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; tap into the insidious idea of &amp;ldquo;the hyperborea.&amp;rdquo; As Abbie Richards, an extremism researcher, succinctly puts it in a video explainer: &amp;ldquo;Hyperborea was this ancient, high civilisation where the Aryan race &amp;ndash; white people &amp;ndash; lived in paradise before they were forced to mix with other races. It&amp;rsquo;s a racist fairytale used to perpetuate white supremacy and to justify racist violence. This stuff is racist and antisemitic but also coded enough that people just engage with it like it&amp;rsquo;s just a story.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The term is rooted in esoteric Nazism, what Richards describes as &amp;ldquo;white supremacy disguised as a web of metaphysical and mystical nonsense. This flavour of Nazism is obsessed with the mythical Aryan race and restoring it [even though] it was never a thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Violence and video games&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, should we worry about these games and others like them? Not necessarily, but it&amp;rsquo;s a difficult line to toe. Researchers have emphasised that it&amp;rsquo;s not about the games themselves as much as how they are used. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing that&amp;rsquo;s inherent in video games that leads people towards extremist views or actions, nor is it the case that the violence within gaming &amp;ndash; or any other medium, like horror films or music &amp;ndash; will act as a form of radicalisation. In 2020, reanalysis of often-cited 2008 research from the American Psychological Association rebuffed claims that video games lead to an increase in aggressive behaviour. On the contrary, after reviewing 28 papers, the Royal Society for Open Science proposed that video games could have a positive impact on cognition and self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moral panics surrounding video games do not help to answer the complex question of why some people commit unthinkable acts. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of pseudo-psychology that sweeps aside structural issues, like regulation in technology and mental health care. By robbing people of their agency, it fails to hold the powerful to account. The National Rifle Association regularly blames video games for mass shootings to deflect from conversations on gun control. Following the shooting in Parkland, Florida in 2018, Trump said that &amp;ldquo;we have to do something ... I&amp;rsquo;m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people&amp;rsquo;s thoughts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would it be possible for an ordinary person without any particularly strong political leanings to spend hours playing &lt;em&gt;Assassins Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and emerge as a neo-Nazi? Kingdon doesn&amp;rsquo;t think so. &amp;ldquo;No, I think it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous to blame the games themselves for radicalisation. Video games themselves don&amp;rsquo;t create terrorists because the narratives in these games are not extreme. It&amp;rsquo;s more about the way they&amp;rsquo;ve been manipulated and weaponised as propaganda,&amp;rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Meme wars&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To really understand radicalisation in technology, we need to understand online subcultures and communities. Gaming has historically been seen as a space for men; games are marketed towards men, and have a history of casual misogyny. Female gamers, journalists and developers are often seen as intruders in this space and are targeted accordingly. At the start of Gamergate in 2014, feminists in gaming seeking better representation in storylines and the industry itself faced an onslaught of online abuse and threats. It is now widely acknowledged that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just organic. White supremacist groups used Gamergate as a political recruiting tool. Steve Bannon described how he was able to identify gamers as &amp;ldquo;These guys, these rootless white males [who] had monster power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As alt-right figures used Gamergate to drum up support for Trump in online, misogynistic spaces, the neo-pagan, hypermasculine figures in alternative history video games have captured the same fan base. While there are plenty of women playing video games they are often still seen as unserious consumers of more violent games marketed to men. In 2022, the Bryter annual gamers study found that an increasing number of women were playing video games, but that 72 per cent of them had experienced some form of harassment, with 36 per cent of them experiencing it regularly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might seem impossible to understand why anyone in society today would be drawn to the same Aryan race myths deployed in propaganda nearly a century ago. But many right-wing groups are adept at understanding and manipulating the language and imagery that young people, or at least some young people, can relate to. &amp;ldquo;The alt right knows that it won&amp;rsquo;t ever be able to get power in the ballot box. The only way they can attempt to gain influence is by shifting things culturally. They use images and symbols not just in games, but in meme culture too,&amp;rdquo; says Kingdon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In her book &lt;em&gt;Meme Wars: The Untold Story of the Online Battles&lt;/em&gt;, Joan Donovan describes how the right were able to capture audiences by offering simple, emotive images and slogans designed to be repeated and reshared across the internet: &amp;ldquo;Meme wars are culture wars, accelerated and intensified because of the infrastructure and incentives of the internet, which trades outrage and extremity as currency, rewards speed and scale, and flattens the experience of the world into a never-ending scroll of images and words, a morass capable of swallowing patience, kindness and understanding.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, too, went through what researchers would describe as a form of memification. By taking screenshots and images from games like these and reposting them online as memes, extremists are able to instruct recruits on how they should be consumed and interpreted. GNET&amp;rsquo;s research points out that in 2018, an Italian far-right activist, Luca Triani, carried out a drive-by shooting in Marceta, where he injured five men and one woman of African origin. Triani was draped in an Italian flag and shouting &amp;ldquo;Viva l&amp;rsquo;Italia.&amp;rdquo; The shooting is thought to have acted as a motivation for the Christchurch attacks in 2019. Triani may have been acting alone, but he was not a &amp;ldquo;lone wolf&amp;rdquo;. The attack came a month before Italy&amp;rsquo;s general election, with parties of almost all political stripes blaming immigrants for frictions in society and a weakened economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His actions also had repercussions in a section of the gaming community, where he became a symbol around which the far right could rally. On Gab, a tech platform popular with social media users on the far right, a widely circulated meme shows Triani portrayed as the leading character in &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, known as Kratos. It was first posted shortly after the attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Not Viking enough'&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s only a small number of people operating in gaming that are locked into these highly distorted views of society. But when these views do appear, they are as deliberately grotesque as possible. A cursory look on Reddit, which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend for anyone&amp;rsquo;s sanity, reveals users complaining that &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s developers Ubisoft have caved in to external pressure and become &amp;ldquo;too woke&amp;rdquo;. The most pressing concern on the thread is that there is no opportunity to rape anyone in the game, which didn&amp;rsquo;t make it &amp;ldquo;Viking&amp;rdquo; enough &amp;ndash; a complaint that&amp;rsquo;s been repeated on several forums. (It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that no popular video game, including &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, offers this function.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to police some of the behaviour in online gaming communities as so much of it is steeped in irony and humour. There&amp;rsquo;s no way of being able to tell if someone sharing a meme or even stating something vulgar or offensive is planning a terrorist act, or even if they believe in what they&amp;rsquo;re saying in any sense. Sometimes, a meme with deeply hidden connotations with the far right has been repeated so many times that it is stripped of its meaning and appears as a simple joke. Even the most advanced of analysts are usually unable to pinpoint someone&amp;rsquo;s motivations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean nothing can be done. TikTok banned the term &amp;ldquo;hyperborea&amp;rdquo; from its search function after fake videos claiming to show forgotten, hidden snow civilisations received millions of views. That won&amp;rsquo;t stop TikTok users who are so inclined to find alternative ways of posting esoteric Nazi content through using similar hashtags, but it at least shows that those holding the reins in big tech are aware of these far-right dog whistles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been attempts within the gaming community to tackle toxic attitudes through broader representation in storylines. &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, for example, includes a female protagonist, while &lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnar&amp;ouml;k&lt;/em&gt;, launched in 2021, has also included Black, female characters. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell, however, how cynical these inclusions may turn out to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While developers may protest that no one can know how any fictional work will be used and adapted, this can also be argued as a reason to be more cautious. The GNET research showed that the developers of &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; were aware that the games risked indulging the far right. And yet they still gave their players storylines that recycled dangerous prejudices. Meanwhile, Ubisoft made over $2 billion in revenue in 2022 alone. In an increasingly right-wing political landscape, games developers and technology companies making extortionate profits can afford to tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here for access to the full magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
