<p class="lead">Ken Ham was asked <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2023/05/06/are-muslims-going-hell/">if Muslims are going to hell</a>. His answer:</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Well, it doesn’t matter if one is a Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Catholic, Mennonite, Muslim, Methodist, Hindu, Sikh, Orthodox Jew, or any other denomination or religious group—if a person has not repented of sin and received the free gift of salvation offered through the Lord Jesus Christ (being “born again”), they will be separated from God for eternity in a place the Bible calls hell. And sadly, the majority of people will go there as Jesus warned, ‘Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many’ (Matthew 7:13).</p></blockquote>
<p>Shorter Ken Ham: yes.</p>

<p>I’ve been giving open book, open notes, online exams with no proctors, no timing, nothin’ but “here’s some questions, have fun answering them” for the last few years, prompted in part by the pandemic. I like it this way. It de-emphasizes rote memorization and requires them to understand the concepts (it also requires me to ask questions that can’t be answered with a recitation or regurgitation.) I also encourage them to study together and collaborate on figuring it all out — although they are required to write answers in their own words, no copying and pasting.</p>
<p>Anyway, all of my final exams are now written and posted to our Canvas site, and I have nothing more to do. Until Friday at 6pm, that is, when all these exams come winging back to me, demanding my immediate attention.</p>
<p>I think I’ll go for a walk.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Today is officially the last day of instruction, but there won’t be much instruction going on — it’s all  administrative stuff for me, acquainting students with the record of their past performance, pointing at the specter of the imminent final exam like a ghost of Christmases yet to be, polishing up that final exam and posting it for them to procrastinate and worry over, the usual bad time at the end of a difficult school year.</p>
<p>Next year will be better, right?</p>
<p>It could be worse. Look at these <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spiders-can-get-so-hungry-they-start-losing-their-eyesight">spider photoreceptors</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/SpiderPhotoreceptors.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/SpiderPhotoreceptors-500x598.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="598" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70039" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/SpiderPhotoreceptors-500x598.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/SpiderPhotoreceptors-125x150.jpeg 125w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/SpiderPhotoreceptors-251x300.jpeg 251w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/SpiderPhotoreceptors.jpeg 642w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a></p>
<p>It turns out that if spiders aren’t properly fed, their photoreceptors start to die off.</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers looked at the bold jumping spider (Phidippus audax), a common species that relies very much on light-sensitive photoreceptors in its large eyes to spot prey. When the spiders don’t get enough nutrients, these photoreceptors can be lost.</p>
<p>“Photoreceptors are energetically costly,” says biologist Elke Buschbeck from the University of Cincinnati. “It’s hard to keep up with their energy needs.”</p>
<p>“If you deprive them of nutrition, the system fails. It’s the functional equivalent of the macula in our eyes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>See, if I don’t have enough research time to take care of my spider colony, they might go blind. I’ll run that by the administration and see if I can get a reduction in teaching load.*</p>
<p>*Note: it will not work.</p>

    <title>Blatant both-siderism from a physicist</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/05/blatant-both-siderism-from-a-physicist/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;A lot of people have been asking me to comment on a recent video by Sabine Hossenfelder. I knew who she is &amp;#8212; she is a science communicator who specializes in physics, and I&amp;#8217;ve seen a few of her videos. They were OK, not particularly interesting to me, just because I&amp;#8217;m on the biology side of the spectrum. Great, though, more people talking about science is a net positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then she did the stereotypical physicist thing: she studies the fundamental building blocks of the universe, energy and matter and mathematics, so she decided to slide over into a field she knows nothing about and &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; it to us. That&amp;#8217;s why people were pestering me to critique her recent video, titled &lt;q&gt;Is being trans a social fad among teenagers?&lt;/q&gt; I guess having a Ph.D. in physics makes you an expert in psychology and sociology as well as biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a look. I only made it 34 seconds into the video before I closed it and said, &amp;#8220;Fuck this.&amp;#8221; This is how she opens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one side you have people claiming that it&amp;#8217;s a socially contagious fad among the brainwashed woke who want to mutilate innocent children. On the other side there are those saying it&amp;#8217;s saving the lives of minorities who have been forced to stay in the closet for too long. And then there are normal people like you and I who think both sides are crazy and could someone summarize the facts in simple words, which is what I am here for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am done. I&amp;#8217;ll never be able to watch another of her videos. You&amp;#8217;d think a physicist would at least understand logic, but there&amp;#8217;s the fallacy of the false dilemma coupled to a bad case of physicist&amp;#8217;s arrogance. It&amp;#8217;s both-siderism with a vengeance. She claims to be all about &lt;q&gt;No hype, no spin,&lt;/q&gt; but she just made a false equivalence between people who are trying to legislate invasive, destructive meddling in people&amp;#8217;s lives, and people who want to be left alone to live their lives without interference, and calls both of them &lt;q&gt;crazy&lt;/q&gt;. That she thinks the right to live a life without being tortured by religious fanatics is crazy is most definitely taking a side and putting a fierce spin on her opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, Sabine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sorry to everyone who wanted me to comment on the rest of her ideas. There&amp;#8217;s 27 more minutes of that crap and I just couldn&amp;#8217;t bear to continue. I&amp;#8217;m cis, and I have no idea how trans people can persist in a society where that kind of nonsense gets served up at you constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#8217;m weak and unable to stomach such stupidity, at least Rebecca Watson, the Iron Skeptic, managed to cope. Here&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://skepchick.org/2023/05/physicist-sabine-hossenfelder-screws-up-on-trans-kids-care/"&gt;her take on Hossenfelder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r6Kau7bO3Fw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, what she said. One the one side you have people who listen to a half-minute of Sabine Hossenfelder and then flip the table, and on the other side there are those who can hear her out and then run circles around her.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Demons of sleep</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6114/demons-of-sleep#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'Night and Sleep' by Evelyn De Morgan. Credit: Heritage Image Partnership" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/MPWRM3.jpg" height="1324" alt="'Night and Sleep' (1878), a painting by Evelyn De Morgan, shows two people drifting through the air" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sleep is a hot topic these days. Popular science books promise to uncover why we do it at all, while exploring its importance for a healthy life. Self-help manuals seek to teach the art of sleeping well amidst the stresses of modern life. Wearable devices and mobile apps monitor quality and quantity, nudging users to make adjustments to their bedtime routines. Meanwhile, last summer&amp;rsquo;s heatwave produced endless variations of top tips for ensuring the right amount of sleep in sweltering temperatures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These examples do not just point to an increased curiosity for an activity that, after all, makes up a third of our lives. Rather, they suggest a certain anxiety around sleep and a desire to master it. The key goal of Matthew Walker&amp;rsquo;s international bestseller &lt;em&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, was to demonstrate the importance of sleep to a society that, he argues, all too often neglects it with disastrous consequences for our health. That was published in 2018. Since then, the idea that our society may be experiencing a &amp;ldquo;sleep crisis&amp;rdquo; has become more popular, with reports that people&amp;rsquo;s sleep debt &amp;ndash; namely, the difference between the amount of sleep they need and the amount they actually get &amp;ndash; has been rising in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This concern over the number of hours people sleep, or fail to, has led to growing attempts at regimenting and optimising the night-time, be it through sleep-tracking, sleep-hygiene routines and sleep hacks, relaxation apps, or other assorted gadgets, from smart mattresses to smart light systems. Underlying these attempts is the sense that sleep should be harnessed. As one popular sleep-tracking wearable puts it: &amp;ldquo;Sleep more. Achieve more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this landscape, Alice Vernon&amp;rsquo;s new book &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It&lt;/em&gt; offers a breath of fresh air. Vernon highlights the need to widen our conversations around sleep beyond the anxious focus on maximising the number of hours we spend doing it. Her stories of troubled sleep purposefully steer well clear of the subject of insomnia &amp;ndash; a condition that has been the core theme of a recent boom of memoirs, such as Marina Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Insomnia&lt;/em&gt; (2018) and Samantha Harvey&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Shapeless Unease: A Year of Not Sleeping&lt;/em&gt; (2020).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, Vernon turns her attention to sleep disorders like somnambulism (sleepwalking), sleep paralysis and hallucinations. And of course, the titular night terrors: terrifying dreams which will typically cause the sleeper to scream and bolt out of bed, and which, unlike nightmares, the sleeper will typically not remember upon waking. Through exploration of these phenomena, &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; invites us to embrace the weirdness of sleep and to look more closely at aspects of our night lives that often thwart any attempts at control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gateway to consciousness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is many things at once: a vivid memoir of Vernon&amp;rsquo;s own experiences of troubled sleep, an accessible account of the science of the sleep disorders that are collectively known as parasomnias, and a rich cultural history of how these disorders have been interpreted and represented throughout the centuries. Such a fluid approach feels fitting. Sleep is both a subject of scientific research, about which we know more and more, and a phenomenon that can still elude our rationality and even fill us with utter horror, producing endless theories and fuelling the imagination. In skillfully weaving the strands of the book together, Vernon perfectly captures the liminal status of sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parasomnias, the focus of &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt;, are undesirable movements, perceptions, behaviours and emotions that arise as the brain transitions between REM (rapid eye movement) sleep &amp;ndash; the stage when dreams tend to occur &amp;ndash; non-REM sleep and wakefulness. These disorders, Vernon tells us, are quite common: 70 per cent of people experience a parasomnia at least once over the course of their life, typically sleep-talking or nightmares. She points out that the real percentage is probably even higher, given that a feature of some sleep disorders is that, upon waking, people do not have any recollection of what they have experienced during the night. What is more, people may be reluctant to talk about them: there is still a certain stigma attached to these &amp;ldquo;sleep demons&amp;rdquo;, which for centuries were explained away through the supernatural, or seen as a mark of insanity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; argues that we need to talk more about parasomnias, both to combat this stigma and to give voice to what these disorders tell us about ourselves. In Vernon&amp;rsquo;s impassioned writing, parasomnias emerge as an important gateway into different forms of consciousness, both individual and collective &amp;ndash; which we ignore at our peril. &amp;ldquo;Our little upheavals or our major traumas&amp;rdquo;, she writes, &amp;ldquo;can all come back through the trapdoor of sleep, so to ignore this part of ourselves can mean that we never really face what our dreams are telling us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader&amp;rsquo;s journey starts with the very first parasomnia that Vernon experienced as a child: sleepwalking. We then move on to hypnopompic hallucinations &amp;ndash; primarily visual hallucinations that manifest moments after waking up; think spiders scuttling on your pillow. Later on, we explore sleep paralysis, night terrors and, finally, dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A thread running through the book is the story of Vernon&amp;rsquo;s claustrophobic and manipulative relationship with a former teacher, whom she calls Meredith after mara, &amp;ldquo;an Old Norse word for a witch who would lie on people&amp;rsquo;s chests and try to suffocate them&amp;rdquo;. The mara is what we now know to be sleep paralysis, a parasomnia where the body&amp;rsquo;s inability to move &amp;ndash; preventing us from acting out our dreams and hurting ourselves or the people we sleep with &amp;ndash; continues after waking up. The person is lying down, fully awake and conscious, and yet entirely unable to move. Even screaming is impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a paradoxical and terrifying situation. In response, the brain can conjure up images of sinister figures looming over the sleeper and weighing them down, to explain the sensation of being pinned to the bed and the feeling of pressure on one&amp;rsquo;s chest and limbs. While Meredith&amp;rsquo;s oppressive hold on teenage Vernon is linked to a number of Vernon&amp;rsquo;s experiences of parasomnias, it is most clearly reflected in the sleep paralysis &amp;ldquo;demons&amp;rdquo; that populate her nights later on in her life. Vernon describes how, during sleep paralysis, she feels &amp;ldquo;crushed under the intense stare of Meredith, under her hands and her sharp nails&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sleep paralysis, nightmares and dreams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chapter on sleep paralysis is among the most engrossing. Beyond exploring the science of this parasomnia and providing memoiristic insights into the trauma that lies at the root of her own experiences, Vernon traces how the disorder has shaped paranoid beliefs across the ages. Looking at the historical records of the 17th-century Salem witch trials, for instance, Vernon learns how experiences of sleep paralysis generated several accusations of witchcraft in the trials. More recently, this parasomnia is thought to be the origin of many reports of alien abductions that supposedly happened at night and were accompanied by a peculiar heavy feeling. &amp;ldquo;What we see during sleep paralysis,&amp;rdquo; Vernon explains, &amp;ldquo;has changed significantly as our cultural depiction of monsters has shifted&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parasomnias seem to have always played a role in the cultural imagination. &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; is peppered throughout with insightful readings of historical paintings and texts, many of which are iconic, that draw on these strange and powerful phenomena. Vernon&amp;rsquo;s reflections on Dracula, the protagonist of Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s 1897 novel, note that he causes paralysis, somnambulism and night terrors in his victims. He was not just a vampire, she concludes, but &amp;ldquo;every parasomnia combined in the figure of a folkloric monster&amp;rdquo;. Just as vampires straddle life and death so do parasomnias &amp;ndash; during these sleep disorders &amp;ldquo;the waking, rational self is effectively &amp;lsquo;dead&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; The book goes on to illustrate how many of our famous writers, from Robert Louis Stevenson to Shirley Jackson, drew inspiration for their fiction from their real-life experiences of various parasomnias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not just that parasomnias can inspire creativity or that culture can help shed light on these strange sleep phenomena. Rather, Vernon argues that storytelling can have therapeutic potential when it comes to sleep. She points to the DreamsID project, a collaboration between sleep scientist Mark Blagrove and artist Julia Lockheart, in which participants share their dreams, nightmares and other parasomnias, whose findings seem to suggest that the process encourages empathy. Imagery rehearsal therapy is also discussed: a cognitive-behavioural treatment for reducing the number and intensity of parasomnias, where the patient is helped to reimagine their nightmares with different, less terrifying outcomes. There are also attempts being made to harness lucid dreaming, which allows people to be aware that they are sleeping and therefore lets them direct their own dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is something deeply liberating about &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; invitation to encounter sleep on its own terms, in all its weirdness and darkness. As Vernon writes, &amp;ldquo;sleep isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the number of hours, [or] the time it takes to nod off . . . Sleep is about stories. It&amp;rsquo;s about monsters, and ghosts, desires, aggression, trauma and anxiety, health, creativity, and the state of our inner lives.&amp;rdquo; Her book is a powerful reminder of what we miss when we think of sleep merely as something to master, in order that we might be more productive in the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alice Vernon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It&amp;rdquo; is published by Icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Zagreus, your character in Hades" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Wallpaper_Zagreus01.jpg" height="1079" alt="The character Zagreus from Hades wear Ancient Greek-style clothing and carries a sword" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, as in life, death is inescapable. In the former, however, death is something you end up looking forward to. It takes a while to get used to; getting killed is usually the one thing you try to avoid in video games. It means you&amp;rsquo;ve failed, and that you have to start again. But in Supergiant Games&amp;rsquo;s 2018 offering, you can&amp;rsquo;t win the game unless you die again, and again, and again. Dying&amp;rsquo;s the whole point. It&amp;rsquo;s what makes you stronger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all, your character, Zagreus, is immortal. He is the son of Hades and he lives in Hell, but he wants out. That&amp;rsquo;s the premise. You grab a weapon, leave your chambers and run towards the surface. You fight your way through the worlds of Tartarus, Asphodel and Elysium, as your dad sends hordes of enemies to try and stop you. If Greek mythology is your thing, you will recognise many of their faces, from the Erinyes and the Lernaean Hydra to the double threat of Asterius and Theseus. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t, don&amp;rsquo;t worry: you&amp;rsquo;ll become acquainted with it soon enough. God, you&amp;rsquo;ll get acquainted with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will be killed by the Furies and killed by the three-headed monster; the king and his bull will kill you and send you down the river Styx, and you will wake up back where you began and you will start again. If it sounds tedious, please understand that it isn&amp;rsquo;t. &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; has won a dizzying number of awards and demand was such that it was eventually released on every single major gaming console.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was so successful, in fact, that Supergiant announced in December that a sequel is coming in 2023. In &lt;em&gt;Hades II&lt;/em&gt;, chthonic nymph Melino&amp;euml; will attempt to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time. In doing so, she will have to die again, and again, and &amp;ndash; you get the gist. The game is predicted to be one of the biggest indie releases of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Playing dead&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an unexpected turn of events. &amp;ldquo;Roguelikes&amp;rdquo;, as this genre of game is called, have been around for many years, but this is the first time one of them has hit the mainstream in such a way. What do I mean by &amp;ldquo;roguelike&amp;rdquo;? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s complicated. I can tell you that the name comes from &lt;em&gt;Rogue&lt;/em&gt;, an ASCII game released in 1980. I can tell you that the term was popularised in Usenet discussion groups in the early 1990s. I can tell you that any attempt to describe the concept fully and in a way that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t anger anyone would take the rest of this essay. Instead, and at risk of making many enemies among the genre&amp;rsquo;s purists, I will sum it up this way. A &amp;ldquo;roguelike&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; or &amp;ldquo;roguelite&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; is, to most people, a game that involves &amp;ldquo;permadeath&amp;rdquo;, i.e. losing means having to start again from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an unusual format. Video game files usually save at the beginning of a level or an encounter with a villain, meaning that dying is an annoying but relatively minor setback. In order not to be mind-numbingly repetitive, each roguelike &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo;, as the attempts to go through the game are called, is subtly different. Enemies appear in a different order, there are different rooms, or different weapons, upgrades and rewards to pick from. These are the basics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Hades_Aug19_04.jpg" height="1080" alt="A scene from Hades shows Zagreus navigating a green land" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, the games are often as rewarding as they are frustrating. You can play better than you ever had, then make one tiny mistake, one slip-up, and you are back at square one. This is presumably why roguelikes took their time to reach more casual gamers, who will only tolerate so much frustration in their pursuit of victory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; was a game-changer because it acknowledged its own reality. Zagreus knows he has died; when he crawls out of Styx, characters welcome him back and affectionately mock his failure. As a result, new subplots and lines of dialogue can only be unlocked by dying a number of times. Losing doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a failure because it isn&amp;rsquo;t one; it is the only way to progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It feels like a beautiful and heavy-handed parable, and a reflection on the very nature of roguelikes. As a more casual gamer myself, I was entranced by &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; and, once I finished it, sought out other games like it. I found &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Slay The Spire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first, I was an amorphous creature able to capture decapitated corpses and use them to fight my way out of a mysterious island, using whatever weapons I could find along the way. In the second, I flitted between being a monk, a soldier, a huntress and an automaton. Using &amp;ldquo;defence&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;attack&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;skill&amp;rdquo; cards, I faced enemies until I was able to escape from the tower I was held in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both games are more traditional examples of their genre. The character I am playing does not know they have been doing the same thing over and over again, or if they do, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter to the story. Instead, in them, I am Zagreus: the burden of knowledge falls on my shoulders. I may get the occasional upgrade but, on a fundamental level, the only thing that matters is my endurance, my willingness to fall, stand back up and go again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;One way out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only way to win is to become a better player, and the only way to become a better player is to keep playing until I know every inch of the game like the palm of my hand. I can only win by being able to predict the patterns of the various enemies, by knowing when I should attack and when I should retreat, by doing things without thinking because I have done them so many times already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also need to know and understand myself as a player: which weapon am I best at wielding? What are my weaknesses? How can I best make use of my strengths? It is a deeply personal &amp;ndash; and occasionally emotional &amp;ndash; endeavour. Like romantic love, roguelikes force you to witness, understand and cherish what is in front of you, what is within yourself and how the two interact with each other. They make you reckon with the importance of seemingly small details and the flaws you wish you didn&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also offer hope in a way that love doesn&amp;rsquo;t always, because they allow you to forget it all and start again. We&amp;rsquo;ve all longed to play god with our own lives, to go back to an interaction we had minutes or months ago and perform as a better version of ourselves. It is a desire that these games can fulfil. If you die at the hand of a monster who unexpectedly hit you twice instead of once at the start of a fight, you can dust yourself off, go back and move away as he prepares to hit again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, there is joy to be found in their familiarity. There is a point you reach with roguelikes, after 30, 50, 70 runs, when the game begins to feel like home. Everything is predictable and there are no surprises anymore. It feels like watching a movie for the hundredth time when stuck at home with a cold, or listening to your favourite songs if you are feeling stressed. Sometimes, nothing is as soothing as a controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the dark and gory nature of many of these games, it can lead to some amusingly absurd moments. I watched the trailer for &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; to jog my memory before writing this and sighed with warm nostalgia at the sight of Charon, who ferries souls into the Underworld. What can I say? We&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time together, he and I.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many other people did too; well over a million of them, in fact. Perhaps that is because they also found the real world, in all its stressful unpredictability, a bit hard to deal with. Retreating into a world of endless, sometimes hypnotising repetition can be a balm to the soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to think that they have also read about &lt;em&gt;Hades II&lt;/em&gt; and Melino&amp;euml; and look forward to getting to know her, as if she were a friend or a lover. If you&amp;rsquo;re one of them, there&amp;rsquo;s only one more thing I can add: I&amp;rsquo;ll see you all in Hell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Paris in Turmoil</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6110/book-review-paris-in-turmoil#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ET9KJR.jpg" height="1279" alt="A Parisian newsagent" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paris in Turmoil: A City Between Past and Future&lt;/strong&gt; (Verso) by Eric Hazan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paris in Turmoil: A City Between Past and Future&lt;/em&gt; is a slim book with wide horizons. Eric Hazan follows his more substantial &lt;em&gt;The Invention of Paris: A History in Footsteps&lt;/em&gt; (2010) with a condensed but fascinating series of vignettes, anecdotes and observations on aspects of Paris&amp;rsquo;s present and past. The daily life of citizens &amp;ndash; with all its tensions, pleasures, adventures and inequalities &amp;ndash; is placed centre stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is part of a strong tradition of urban writing that functions variously as cultural history, political critique and a kind of subversive tourist guide. Hazan takes conscious inspiration from this tradition, referencing Louis-S&amp;eacute;bastien Mercier&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Tableau de Paris&lt;/em&gt;, a monumental account of everyday life in the city that implicitly addressed social inequality and political tension on the eve of the French Revolution. Attending to the panorama of everyday life rather than the affairs of ruling elites, Mercier&amp;rsquo;s work influenced later novelists like Balzac, who appears in &lt;em&gt;Paris in Turmoil&lt;/em&gt; along with Victor Hugo and Charles Baudelaire. The book&amp;rsquo;s other antecedents include Walter Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s unfinished &lt;em&gt;Arcades Project&lt;/em&gt;, which tied the 19th-century construction of Parisian shopping arcades to the city&amp;rsquo;s wider cultural and political life, and the Situationists&amp;rsquo; development of the d&amp;eacute;rive or drift &amp;ndash; the experience of unplanned wandering and observation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paris in Turmoil&lt;/em&gt; applies and extends these traditions to the more recent changes wrought on 21st-century Paris, taking in the city&amp;rsquo;s art, architecture, commerce and culture as well as its politics. The book is notable for drawing out historical and sociological significance from the seemingly mundane: the changing clientele of certain caf&amp;eacute;s from students and Surrealists to hipsters and tourists; the varying density of tobacco shops as a marker of a neighbourhood&amp;rsquo;s class character; plus the changing ownership of these shops as a reflection of waves of migration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hazan&amp;rsquo;s focus on the detail, colour and texture of Paris has the effect of transporting you there: at a zinc caf&amp;eacute; counter, the window-display of a drearily upmarket boutique, or the bleak confines of the Boulevard P&amp;eacute;riph&amp;eacute;rique, the dual-carriageway that rings the city and &amp;ndash; in a familiar pattern &amp;ndash; separates the wealthy centre from its hinterland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inequality and frequently spectacular attempts to address it have long been associated with Paris, from the Jacobins and sans-culottes of the French Revolution to the barricades of 1832 and 1968, to the 2005 riots in the city&amp;rsquo;s poorer and racialised banlieues over youth unemployment and police harassment. Discussing the often reactionary politics behind urban planning, Hazan quotes the Situationist Guy Debord&amp;rsquo;s assertion that Paris &amp;ldquo;was ravaged a little before all the others because its ever-renewed revolutions had so worried and shocked the world&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book tracks the changes imposed on the city, both past and present, as a form of restriction or marginalisation, an attempt to impose control upon chaos &amp;ndash; notably Haussmann&amp;rsquo;s building of wide and straight avenues through districts like the &amp;Icirc;le de la Cit&amp;eacute;, whose raucous and lawless nature made them fertile ground for revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hazan notes how the effects of modernisation and gentrification continue to impact today&amp;rsquo;s marginalised groups: the city&amp;rsquo;s working class, homeless, refugees and migrant workers. Boundaries and limits are a recurring theme, with the often subtle or intangible restrictions they present undermining the city&amp;rsquo;s romantic potential for freedom and discovery. Importantly, too, the book offers ideas for improvement along with its criticisms, ranging from street names that better reflect the city&amp;rsquo;s artistic and political history to the practical development of traffic intersections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many aspects that Hazan identifies have clear relevance to other cities. The homogenisation of commercial centres, the rising rents driving poorer citizens to the city&amp;rsquo;s fringes or beyond, and urban gentrifiers known in Paris as bobos will all be recognisable to any recent observer of somewhere like east London. This is a book rooted in the author&amp;rsquo;s lifelong experience as a citizen, critic and obvious aficionado of Paris in particular, but it has wider application in the struggle to retain the radical and democratic past of life in cities which, as this book shows, can still be glimpsed beneath their contemporary gloss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>When voters get it wrong</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6107/when-voters-get-it-wrong#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistFalseConsciousness2.jpg" height="1486" alt="A cartoon shows a sneering man smothering a voter as they cast their ballot" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If real life was a Hollywood movie, a great many world leaders &amp;ndash; from Putin to Orb&amp;aacute;n to Bolsonaro &amp;ndash; would be classic, almost cheesy villains. Yet according to a curious modern orthodoxy, we are led to believe that politicians who are elected must be taken seriously, lest we insult those who voted them in. Even as elected politicians across the world commit acts as outrageous as razing the Amazon, inciting a gun-wielding mob or deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda, their actions are normalised. The bad guys are winning everywhere, but any desire to stop them is perversely constrained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the field of economics, it is commonplace to observe that people make bad decisions. We neglect our pensions, stick with our overpriced insurance plans and scoff mediocre takeaways on the sofa. In fact, an entire sub-field, behavioural economics, is devoted to anatomising different varieties of poor decisions &amp;ndash; from bias (systematic errors that skew everyone&amp;rsquo;s choices in a single direction) to noise (random mistakes caused by the vagaries of individual circumstance). Bestselling books have brought these insights to a global audience: &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt; by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahnemann lays bare the cognitive flaws that &amp;ldquo;consistently violate&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;rules of rational choice&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two other behavioural economists, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, developed nudge theory as a policy response: if we can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted to make good decisions, then corporations and governments should design better &amp;ldquo;choice architecture&amp;rdquo; to help us improve our lives by default. Rates of organ donation are increased by switching from opt-in to opt-out; school cafeterias encourage healthier diets by placing salad rather than chips at eye level. The &amp;ldquo;science of choice&amp;rdquo;, Thaler and Sunstein wrote in their highly influential book &lt;em&gt;Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness&lt;/em&gt;, has &amp;ldquo;raised serious questions about the rationality of many judgements and decisions that people make&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet if we are quite happy to admit we are irrational in the realm of economics, when it comes to politics, the very notion that people tick the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; boxes is taboo &amp;ndash; even if doing so adversely affects their lives. Indeed, the more wrong-headed the decision, the harder it is to criticise, as &amp;ldquo;remoaners&amp;rdquo; have found to their cost. In 2017, Conservative MP Robert Goodwill defended the ongoing disaster of Brexit by rejecting the idea that &amp;ldquo;the British people who voted for Brexit were stupid and didn&amp;rsquo;t understand&amp;rdquo;; on the contrary, he insisted, &amp;ldquo;they knew exactly what they were voting for&amp;rdquo;. That phrase &amp;ldquo;the will of the people&amp;rdquo; implies, in itself, conscious self-determination; utilitarian action designed to produce good consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the supermarket, therefore, humans are frail and erring, but as soon as they step into the voting booth they become discerning and perspicacious. Voters&amp;rsquo; views are truths to be divined by pollsters; politicians endlessly refer to the need to &amp;ldquo;listen&amp;rdquo;; media pundits refer to opinions they hear &amp;ldquo;on the doorstep&amp;rdquo; as if they are inherently original, rather than noting the resemblance to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s headlines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more democracy is hollowed out, corrupted and degraded, the more naively we take voting at face value. As Trump ransacked constitutional rules and norms, liberals tied themselves in knots; they were desperate to critique a figure clearly outside the boundary of democratic acceptability, yet felt they had to respect his place within it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if homo economicus was knocked off his pedestal decades ago, homo politicus is still very much intact. We are well aware of the depressingly effective commercial forces shaping consumer behaviour &amp;ndash; Percy Pigs at the till, byzantine energy tariffs &amp;ndash; yet the dark arts of political persuasion are far less widely discussed. Raise the possibility that, in 2023, we are under the spell of propaganda, and you run the risk of being accused of a kind of student-y, out-dated scaremongering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The return of false consciousness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There used to be a name for voting against your best interests: false consciousness. But the term has fallen out of fashion amongst academics and commentators. For political scientist Colin Hay, it &amp;ldquo;conjures up a deeply condescending conception of the social subject as an ideological dupe&amp;rdquo;. High up above the &amp;ldquo;ideological mists which tame the masses&amp;rdquo; is the &amp;ldquo;enlightened academic&amp;rdquo; who may &amp;ldquo;look down to discern the genuine interests of those not similarly blessed&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet our reluctance to interrogate manifestly poor electoral choices means that it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to acknowledge the reality of malign political persuasion at the worst possible time. In the UK and elsewhere, we are more influenced than ever by ministerial message discipline, continual polling and spin on an industrial scale. Reports of the death of the traditional media are in an important sense premature: newspaper circulation may be in free-fall, but these mostly billionaire-owned outlets still have a surprisingly strong hold over public conversation. The reaction of the &lt;em&gt;Mail&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; to the latest skulduggery of the British government sets the tone: the question of &amp;ldquo;cut through&amp;rdquo;, how things are &amp;ldquo;playing&amp;rdquo; with the public, is the only test that matters. Scandals like &amp;ldquo;Partygate&amp;rdquo; have been largely contained by tabloids selecting only the tamest photographs of Boris Johnson celebrating his birthday during lockdown, accompanied by forgiving headlines such as &amp;ldquo;Is that it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Power is not now simply imposed. It&amp;rsquo;s exerted insidiously through the aggressively ascendant illusion that ordinary working people are finally having their say. Contemporary autocrats are masters of the humility topos, deploying winning hubris to defuse any challenge. Posh and rich as they are, these faux friends of the grassroots constantly cite the wisdom of the voter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just when we need it most, the critique of manipulation has been depoliticised and transposed to a technocratic realm, defused by popular science facts and consumer finance tips, and recruited to the self-help project of life optimisation. Interestingly, Cass Sunstein published a book in 2021 promisingly titled &lt;em&gt;Liars: Falsehoods and Free Speech in an Age of Deception&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s concerned with myths such as those spread by anti-vaxxers, rather than political persuasion. It&amp;rsquo;s a firmly apolitical book, in fact, which displays an uncritical belief in governments&amp;rsquo; ability to regulate misinformation; never mind the mendacious behaviour of many democratically elected governments themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Britannica definition, &amp;ldquo;false consciousness&amp;rdquo; denotes &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rsquo;s inability to recognise inequality, oppression, and exploitation in a capitalist society because of the prevalence within it of views that naturalise and legitimise the existence of social classes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a time when this concept animated academic seminars and Labour party meetings. It&amp;rsquo;s usually attributed to Karl Marx, but the phrase was coined by Friedrich Engels, in a letter to the Communist scholar Franz Mehring in 1893. In any case, both Marx and Engels argued that capitalism operates not only by oppressing the workers, but also by persuading them to conspire in their oppression by subscribing to the myth of social mobility. Later, Marxists used the concept to account for the apparent puzzle of why workers didn&amp;rsquo;t revolt. Theorists such as Antonio Gramsci and Louis Althusser described how the ruling classes cultivate shared forms of &amp;ldquo;common sense&amp;rdquo; that disguise and sustain inequality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A version of this idea originated much earlier: the 16th-century poet, magistrate and friend of Michel de Montaigne, &amp;Eacute;tienne de La Bo&amp;eacute;tie, wrote that there are three possible reasons why people submit to tyranny: the force of custom; distraction by &amp;ldquo;bread and circuses&amp;rdquo;; and the fact that tyrants surround themselves with expanding circles of loyal dependents: in other words, as the sociologist Steven Lukes summarises, &amp;ldquo;inertia, manufactured consent, and patronage&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thomas Frank updated the idea with scathing verve in his classic 2004 book &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the Matter with Kansas?&lt;/em&gt;, which exposes the paradox &amp;ldquo;of working-class guys in mid-western cities cheering as they deliver up a landslide for a candidate whose policies will end their way of life, will transform their region into a &amp;lsquo;rustbelt&amp;rsquo;, will strike people like them blows from which they will never recover&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More recent still is the popular &amp;ldquo;Leopards Ate My Face&amp;rdquo; parody thread on the Reddit website, satirising people who regret their predictably disastrous electoral choices: &amp;ldquo;Leopards Ate My Face When I Voted For The Leopards Eating People&amp;rsquo;s Faces Party&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Systematic falsehoods&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these articulations of false consciousness are the rare exceptions. Left-wing theorists abandoned the territory just as prominent right-wingers began to co-opt their ideas: the British Conservative politician Michael Gove cites Gramsci as a strategic, if not ideological, influence. Progressives, meanwhile, have become diffident and tongue-tied, stricken with the fear of associating delusion with class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it is that we find ourselves in a toxic spiral. As nudge theorists are fond of pointing out (presumably in order to not appear paternalistic), smart people can be duped too. They may be, in some cases, more susceptible &amp;ndash; as David Robson claims to show in his 2020 book &lt;em&gt;The Intelligence Trap: Why Smart People Make Dumb Mistakes&lt;/em&gt;. But making good decisions is not just about being smart; it&amp;rsquo;s also about having access to good information. It&amp;rsquo;s therefore a problem that we live in a culture that demonises the intellectual &amp;ldquo;elite&amp;rdquo;: being well-informed has itself come to be regarded as a marker of being out of touch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The association between rationality, condescension and well-meaning but patronising progressives erodes our ability to call out right-wing administrations when voters are misled. Perverse decisions are validated against supposedly &amp;ldquo;elitist&amp;rdquo; reason. As one American voter told Buzzfeed during the 2016 election: &amp;ldquo;Hillary Clinton isn&amp;rsquo;t alone in saying 25 per cent of Americans are deplorable. That is a sentiment that is rampant upon the American left. . . . And I think the American people aren&amp;rsquo;t stupid. And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem with Hillary Clinton. She thinks we&amp;rsquo;re all stupid.&amp;rdquo; Clinton was wrong to blame the sinner rather than the sin, but her mistake has led to almost universal liberal anxiety about questioning voters&amp;rsquo; choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Progressives collude, therefore, in the conservative framing of this scepticism as the left not having faith in voters. &amp;ldquo;The Conservatives,&amp;rdquo; Jacob Rees-Mogg commented about the 2019 election that handed Boris Johnson an 80-seat majority, &amp;ldquo;trust the British people &amp;ndash; the opposition benches do not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The phrase &amp;ldquo;people aren&amp;rsquo;t stupid&amp;rdquo; sounds egalitarian, but it actually perpetuates inequality. As the sociologist Steve Hanson has commented: &amp;ldquo;False consciousness doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the working classes are idiots, but it does mean that they have been systematically fed untruth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Whose interests?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what if people know they&amp;rsquo;re being lied to, but choose to vote against their interests anyway? And who gets to define what &amp;ldquo;best interests&amp;rdquo; really means? Affluent progressives, for their part, arguably exhibit economic false consciousness every time they vote for left-wing parties that would tax more of their income.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the philosopher Slavoj Žižek notes, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to have a very clear idea of what the reality is and still act in self-destructive ways. &amp;ldquo;One knows the falsehood very well,&amp;rdquo; he writes, showing the limitations of the Britannica definition of false consciousness, &amp;ldquo;and still one does not denounce it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the working class in Britain, some voters may be ideologically right-wing, while others may feel &amp;ndash; even after decades of austerity, low wages and measly benefits under successive Conservative governments &amp;ndash; that the other side is not much better. In some countries, the left have now been out of office so long they&amp;rsquo;re considered almost &amp;ldquo;unelectable&amp;rdquo;: they&amp;rsquo;ve effectively lost their clout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another explanation is that put-upon voters favour right-wing parties that appear to confer on them some dignity, as opposed to liberals who seem to pity them. Around the world, shabbily corrupt populists have done a pretty good job of convincing ordinary people that they are themselves reassuringly ordinary, in the sense of vividly exemplifying the crooked timber of humanity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And populists have also convinced many blue-collar voters that, despite their offshore wealth and private jets, they share those voters&amp;rsquo; values. The very politicians who promote the financialisation of everything piously point out that not everything is about money, you know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The culture wars have turbocharged this process. Republicans in the US have used social policies &amp;ndash; on abortion, or immigration &amp;ndash; to encourage poor white voters to betray their economic interests. Here in the UK, confected debates about patriotism and &amp;ldquo;wokeness&amp;rdquo; are shifting the political fault-line ever further away from the gaping socio-economic divide and towards a split based on social attitudes, level of education and whether you live in a city or a seaside town.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Time for an update&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is some evidence that working-class support for parties that will harm them economically is overstated. The authors of a 2016 journal article entitled &amp;ldquo;There Is Nothing Wrong with Kansas&amp;rdquo; found that poor white voters in America actually tend to vote for Democrats around 75 per cent of the time. They found that the small remaining group of poor whites who vote Republican didn&amp;rsquo;t vote against their interests more often than other groups. So it&amp;rsquo;s complicated. The result of the next general election will be influenced by a number of factors, including rationality, compassion, self-interest and cynicism. But voters will also be influenced by ideology, still energetically propagated by old and new media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, left-leaning think tanks have focused much of their energies on extending and enhancing voter &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo;: developing digital democracy platforms, or participatory budgeting initiatives. It&amp;rsquo;s right to give more people more of a say. But we should also examine why they say what they do, and acknowledge that simply having a voice (on social media or in a citizens&amp;rsquo; assembly) doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily diminish the powerful factors influencing people&amp;rsquo;s views and allegiances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the original Marxist meaning of false consciousness is now ill-suited to today&amp;rsquo;s complex, diverse society, it is high time we updated it. Otherwise, the monopolies and magnates wrecking the world will continue to be bolstered by the widespread notion that they do so with authentic grassroots consent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the political earthquakes of 2016, there&amp;rsquo;s been a surfeit of commentary about &amp;ldquo;post-truth&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fake news&amp;rdquo;. Yet while we may accept we are living in this environment, there is still a widespread nervousness about accepting that &amp;ndash; individually and collectively &amp;ndash; we are being managed. As plutocrats prosper and the planet burns, we must channel our energies into understanding how public opinion is shaped. Those who regard themselves as progressive are letting the bad guys get away with it. We think we are doing the right thing, but we are getting it all wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Reality is dead, long live reason</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Hilary Lawson is a philosopher and founder of the Institute of Art and Ideas" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/hilary-lawsonsquare02.jpg" height="571" alt="Hilary Lawson" width="700"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is 1882, 140 years ago. Bismarck is chancellor in Germany, Gladstone is Prime Minister in Britain, and memories of the Civil War are still fresh in the United States. A relatively unknown academic, Frederick Nietzsche, publishes what is now known as &lt;em&gt;The Gay Science&lt;/em&gt;, originally translated as &amp;ldquo;The Joyful Wisdom&amp;rdquo;. His academic career has foundered. He has given up his academic post, and almost no one is buying his work. Yet this particular book will be a major influence on all subsequent western thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the third section of &lt;em&gt;The Gay Science&lt;/em&gt;, Nietzsche makes his most controversial claim: God is dead, and goes on to say that we killed him. While he sometimes has Christianity in his sights, the case he is making is broader than the demise of a Christian God. Nietzsche is pointing to the demise of an authority higher or above the human and making the case that belief in the divine had been killed by the gradual unfurling of the Enlightenment and the progress of human knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book and the claim had no immediate impact for there was, initially, no discernible audience. Yet the claim was prophetic. Religious belief in the West has been in gradual but continuous decline ever since. In Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s time, almost all children were baptized. Today, in England, only six per cent of the population regularly attend church.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what replaced God? Reality. A reality uncovered by observation, understanding and science. For those who have now taken leave of the notion of God, reality has a straight-forward, down to earth quality. It is the opposite of superstition. It may not have the magic and mystery of religious belief, but it enables in its place a calm, measured assessment of the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet strangely, reality, our replacement for God, turns out to share some of the key characteristics that have traditionally been applied to God. For example, God is understood to be everywhere and everything, but at the same time unknowable, elusive, unattainable. And so, it turns out, is reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A universe of fields and energy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most will accept that reality is everywhere and everything. Less obvious is that it is unknowable, elusive and unattainable. I&amp;rsquo;m a longstanding critic of philosophical realism and the notion that our language and theories are capable of describing reality. So you might expect me to claim that reality is elusive and unattainable. However, over the last few years, many leading neuroscientists working on human perception and cognition have come to similar conclusions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Beau Lotto, professor of neuroscience at the University of London, used optical illusions to demonstrate that &amp;ldquo;Our brains did not evolve to sense reality; they evolved to give us what is useful for our survival.&amp;rdquo; Donald Hoffman, professor of cognitive science at the University of California Irvine, argues that what we take to be reality is akin to icons on a desktop. &amp;ldquo;Whatever reality is, it is not what you see. What you see is just an adaptive fiction.&amp;rdquo; While David Eagleman, a Stanford neuroscientist and leading researcher into brain plasticity concludes &amp;ldquo;reality is an illusion &amp;ndash; perpetuated by our brains&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just several prominent neuroscientists. The framework of contemporary physics has also uncovered the elusive nature of reality. Once we imagined reality was ultimately made of indivisible minute particles we called atoms. Now we have a series of Chinese boxes each with smaller particles, protons, neutrons, quarks, leptons, bosons. As we examine them closer their material quality itself evaporates. Instead, we have a universe of fields and energy. It is as if we have lost the stuff of the world altogether. Niels Bohr, one of the founders of contemporary physics, concluded "Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heisenberg, one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, who won a Nobel prize for the creation of quantum mechanics, abandoned the notion that science was capable of uncovering reality altogether, &amp;ldquo;objective reality has evaporated&amp;rdquo;. More recently, Stephen Hawking, who in &lt;em&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/em&gt; had thought a theory of everything was in our grasp, abandoned this view in 2010 and concluded that science was only capable of providing models and the ultimate character of the world was beyond us. &amp;ldquo;There is no model-independent test of reality&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last century has also seen the relentless uncovery of the inability of human thought to break free from the limitation of its particular perspective. Our narratives and theories, our histories and most fundamental beliefs, have been identified as the outcome of a particular language, history and culture, and the product of particular brain chemistry and physiology. There is no human access to a God&amp;rsquo;s eye view of the world that can somehow see the world as it &amp;lsquo;really&amp;rsquo; is. Sociologists, historians and philosophers have all played their part in uncovering the profoundly limited and human character of thought and perception. So, from all sides, the idea that we have access to reality is under attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Peering behind the veil?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the puzzle over reality is even trickier than it first appears. For it initially encourages the notion that we might be able to peer behind the veil and discover the truth. Confronted with the impossibility of this task, there is a temptation to search instead for an alternative underlying hidden or non-material version of reality, as if behind the illusion we can find the real thing. This has led some to propose that reality is consciousness, or material things are also conscious. Thinkers like Donald Hoffman and Iain McGilchrist have rightly identified the extent to which our account of the world is a product of our particular brain physiology. But they then go on to toy with these idealist or panpsychist 'solutions'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But this is a wild goose chase. The new non-material 'reality' is going to be just as illusory as the materialist account. If what we take to be reality is an illusion, we are not going to be able to frame a metaphysical story that describes how it really is. Any account we give of this underlying 'reality' will itself be from a limited human perspective, and limited also by the constraints of a given language, culture, and context. &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 18th century, the hugely influential philosopher Immanuel Kant reframed the history of thought by posing the question: how must thought be structured in order for us to have knowledge? Instead, we now have to address the central question about reality by beginning from the opposite starting point &amp;ndash; that we have no knowledge and no means of reaching through to describe the ultimate character of reality. The contemporary philosophical challenge is to explain how it is possible for us to intervene with such precision and accuracy in the world, even though we cannot know how things are. How is that we are able to share and talk about a seemingly fixed and known reality? How is that you can make your way home using your previous experience or by consulting Google maps? How is it that we can invent successful vaccines or send satellites into space if our theories are not precise descriptions of an objective reality and ultimate knowledge is not possible?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is not going to be one definitive answer to this question. As if we might give a final explanation of the nature of the human condition. For to do so would at once be a description of an ultimate reality. But that does not mean that there is nothing to say. We have to attempt to provide a means to make sense of our circumstances, even while knowing that it cannot be a final account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Responding to the world&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The framework I have used to help escape from this deep puzzle, initially outlined in the book &lt;em&gt;Closure: a story of everything&lt;/em&gt;, proposes that reality should not be taken to be a thing or combination of things that we might describe. Instead it proposes that we close the openness of the world with our sensations, thoughts and language. Through this process of closure, we hold the world as things, objects and actions. People and objects, the sea and the sky, atoms and histories are not found in the world, they are instead ways by which we close the openness of the world. Language does not describe the world, instead it holds the world &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; something. Language provides us with metaphors for the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might think this is a very unlikely starting point. After all, if the world is nothing in particular, how is it that we all agree on so much? If our language and thought have nothing in common with reality, how is it that we can intervene so precisely?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the question first appears baffling, the starting point of an explanation is straight-forward. We make sense of reality not by describing it but by reacting to its consequences. Our senses do not observe the world, they respond to the world, and we hold those responses as things and characteristics through the process of closure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What the framework of openness and closure demonstrates is that we can give a detailed account of the success of our theories and beliefs without proposing that they describe how reality ultimately is. In providing this demonstration, the theory also accounts for why it is itself possible without at the same time claiming to have definitively described the nature of the human condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In abandoning the notion that our accounts of the world describe reality, we have to rethink the nature of all belief. Our theories and beliefs, our accounts of the world, are not only no longer absolute, they cannot be an attempt to be absolute. Our theories are not, to use a phrase that Hawking used when he believed in a theory of everything, a glimpse into &amp;ldquo;the mind of God&amp;rdquo;. They are instead human frameworks, created at a given point in cultural history, set in a certain language, that help us to achieve things that we would not be able to do otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Doubling down on reason&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The passing of reality is not something to regret, but something to lift our spirits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can feel confident of the value and strength of our current theories and accounts of the world, while at the same time recognising that they will in due course be modified and eventually abandoned in favour of alternatives that will be thought to be more effective, or more powerful, or more desirable. Millenia of exploration and testing of our temporary metaphors have enabled us to refine them and create versions that allow us to have lives that those in the past could hardly imagine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This ability to improve our circumstances and address our desires and goals does not need to come at the cost of limiting the world to the stories we have adopted or to imagining that there are no alternatives, or that we might have arrived at a final answer, or that there is a truth of the matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Observation and reason led us to imagine that we were uncovering the ultimate character of the world, that reality was being laid bare. It was no such thing. Instead, we were refining our closures to enable them to be more successful at predicting what would happen and helping us to intervene to achieve outcomes we could not achieve otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In contemporary culture, partly as a result of an awareness of the importance of perspective, many have become critical of observation and reason. Instead, we need to double down on observation and reason; not to uncover the truth, but to test our closures, our metaphors, our ways of holding the world. For it is only by observing where they work and where they fail that we are able to refine them &amp;ndash; or, if need be, abandon them in favour of others. Instead of being critical of observation and reason, it is the idea that we are uncovering reality that we need to abandon. The idea that there is a correct way to think. An endpoint where we can rest our account of the world. Our closures provide us with what we take to be reality but they have nothing in common with openness, and their success is not dependent on describing the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reality, it turns out, is a theological notion. An ultimate that cannot be reached. And it is time we rid ourselves of its superstition. It is not only God that is dead, but reality itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By giving up the idea of uncovering reality we can instead seek to realise the unlimited potential of openness, enabling us to achieve things we do not think currently possible. We can improve the circumstances in which we operate, and counter prejudice and injustice, but we should not imagine that we are right, or that we have said how the world is. Instead, we have offered a way of thinking that enables change, and that helps create new, different, and hopefully better futures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Postscript: The approach I have advocated here is but one way to respond to the uncovery of our inability to describe reality. There will, of course, be others. At the same time, any such account offers a means of holding the world, which has the appearance of holding fast that which in the end cannot be held at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hilary Lawson is founder of HowTheLightGetsIn festival.

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Someone contacted me hoping to find young atheists who might be interested in being part of a new series.
