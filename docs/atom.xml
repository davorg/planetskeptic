<p>The correct answer is, obviously, “Your mom.”</p>
<p>But seriously, if I tell you something is a range or continuum, you don’t refute me by telling me I have to name every shade. When I was a child, I learned that there are 7 colors, precisely 7, in the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Then when I got older I learned that there are hundreds of wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers. And then when I got older still I learned that color is the product of combinations of wavelengths, like chords, and the numbers got larger still. And then I learned about photoreception and color vision, and discovered that colors were a property of visual processing derived from context and relative distinctions in illumination and intensity, and there’s nothing fixed about them. I read David Marr in the 1980s, you know.</p>
<p>Then someone comes along and insists that the stuff they learned in kindergarten is the absolute rock solid truth.</p>
<p>Hey, I bet you this person is also one of those who mocks the abbreviation LGBTQIA+ because there are too many letters in it and we keep adding more.</p>

    <title>Who will replace Ken Ham?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/12/who-will-replace-ken-ham/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Calm down, he&amp;#8217;s not dead yet. At his age, though, he&amp;#8217;s probably contemplating his future successor. Bodie Hodge, his son-in-law, is a blithering goober, and the other people at the top of his organization are &lt;em&gt;women&lt;/em&gt;, so naturally they&amp;#8217;re out of the running. Andrew Snelling, Terry Mortenson, Danny Faulkner? Negative charisma. Tim Chaffey? He&amp;#8217;s tall, that&amp;#8217;s about it. Nathaniel Jeanson? An insufferable twit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Ken has been recruiting back in the homeland of Australia, and he has landed a real winner: Martyne Iles. He&amp;#8217;s perfect. He&amp;#8217;s young. He&amp;#8217;s loud. He&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-is-the-australian-christian-lobby-waging-a-culture-war-over-lgbtq-issues-127805"&gt;a confirmed hater&lt;/a&gt;: he doesn&amp;#8217;t want anything to do with the gays or the transes, he despises the idea of climate change, he hates commies. He&amp;#8217;s a cerfiable culture warror, and his ideology lines up nicely with Ken Ham&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now he&amp;#8217;s been hired as Chief Ministry Officer for Answers in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Martyne-Iles.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Martyne-Iles-500x964.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="964" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70110" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Martyne-Iles-500x964.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Martyne-Iles-78x150.jpeg 78w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Martyne-Iles-156x300.jpeg 156w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Martyne-Iles-768x1481.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/Martyne-Iles.jpeg 1406w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also interesting: he was formerly the &lt;a href="https://christiantoday.com.au/news/martyn-iles-removed-as-managing-director-of-australian-christian.html"&gt;Managing Director of the Australian Christian Lobby&lt;/a&gt;, but he was kicked out. The apparent cause was that the ACL, under his leadership, was flopping badly. &lt;a href=""&gt;Australians kept passing those danged liberal laws&lt;/a&gt; anyway. He was ineffective and obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACL grew rapidly under Iles – its membership tripled, Iles said – but its size wasn’t the board’s problem. It was struggling for political impact. In a few short years, it recorded losses on virtually every single key issue: same-sex marriage was legalised in 2017, just months before Iles took the post; almost every state in the country has loosened laws on abortion and voluntary assisted dying; and major steps against gay conversion therapy have been made in Victoria, WA and NSW. And faced with the potential for a multi-term Labor government that saw the group as – at best – irrelevant, the Australian Christian Lobby needed a major strategic reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now he has left Australia to a country that if more favorable ideologically. He&amp;#8217;s just like Ken Ham!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have one other thing in common: they&amp;#8217;re both abominably stupid. Here&amp;#8217;s Iles&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;evidence for god&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='center'&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mpzBBWN_jrc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one ever thought that intricacy could come out of simplicity or that order could come out of chaos in anything except creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;q&gt;beautiful sunsets&lt;/q&gt;. Fanaticism and banality, such a great combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a match made in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">Elon Musk has announced that he has found a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/11/twitter-elon-musk-new-ceo/">replacement CEO for Twitter</a>, currently rumored to be an ad executive name Linda Yaccarino. That could change. Musk is a dorky flibbertigibbet who might change his mind depending on how the rumor is received.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter, though. Nothing will improve.</p>
<ul>
<li>He’s personally selecting a CEO, which means it will be someone who aligns with his views.</li>
<li>Whoever he hires will be under his control, and he’s a micromanaging tyrant.</li>
<li>Whoever he hires will be subject dismissal if she crosses him.</li>
<li>He has driven the company so far into the ground, both in income and reputation, that there’s no hope.</li>
<li>It’s a Musk decision. Every decision he makes is terrible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel pity for anyone who gets lured into this position, although, given the kind of person who’d willingly associate with Elon Musk, I suspect any sympathy would evaporate after their first day on the job.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Oh, actually, this announcement is a <em>distraction</em>. Quick, focus on the Twitter noise, not the costly <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/05/12/economy/china-tesla-recall-intl-hnk/index.html">recall of Tesla cars in China</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tesla will recall more than 1.1 million cars in China due to potential safety risks, the country’s top market regulator said on Friday.</p>
<p>Starting May 29, the US company will take back 1,104,622 vehicles that were produced between January 12, 2019, and April 24, 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said in a statement, citing a plan filed by Tesla (TXLZF) with the regulator.</p>
<p>That’s nearly equivalent to Tesla’s total sales in mainland China during the four-year period. From 2019 to March 2023, Tesla sold about 1.09 million vehicles in the country, according to CNN calculations based on figures from China’s state-backed industry associations.</p>

    <title>Malaria vaccine: A scientific victory</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6116/malaria-vaccine-a-scientific-victory#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Diana Polekhina on Unsplash" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/diana-polekhina-ZBstHWt9vLc-unsplash.jpg" height="850" alt="A stock photo of a syringe containing a yellow liquid" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Ghana became the first country in the world to approve a highly effective malaria vaccine, an achievement 80 years in the making. Known as R21, it is the first for malaria &amp;ndash; or indeed any parasitic disease &amp;ndash; to exceed the World Health Organization&amp;rsquo;s 75 per cent efficacy target. Parasites are much more complex than viruses or bacteria, so this is a major breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Preliminary results from final-stage trials have not yet been published, but Ghana has already cleared the vaccine for use in children aged 5-36 months &amp;ndash; the group at highest risk of death from malaria. Nigeria followed suit shortly afterwards. The WHO is still reviewing the data to determine whether it will recommend the vaccine for widespread use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge of targeting the malaria parasite is that it changes its structure throughout its lifecycle. R21 targets the parasite at a very early stage, before it has spread extensively throughout the body. This rapid response is helped along by an &amp;ldquo;adjuvant&amp;rdquo; (an ingredient that boosts the body&amp;rsquo;s immune response to vaccines) called Matrix-M, which comes from the Chilean soapbark tree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another major obstacle has been funding. Pharmaceuticals typically invest in vaccines expecting to recoup the costs by selling them to wealthy countries. But malaria mostly affects lower-income countries. R21 was developed by researchers at Oxford University&amp;rsquo;s Jenner Institute, which also developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19. Their work was supported by awards from the European Commission, UK Research and Innovation, the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Serum Institute of India, among others. According to Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, it is the first major vaccine to be approved by an African country before rich nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new vaccine is no silver bullet. Doubts remain about the reported efficacy as trials continue, and about the practicalities of delivery, as it requires three initial doses and possibly boosters, which can be a challenge in rural areas. Funding for a widespread rollout also remains an issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, R21 marks a major scientific advancement and brings significant hope in the fight against one of the world&amp;rsquo;s deadliest diseases. It comes on the back of two decades of impressive progress against malaria, mainly through the use of antimalarial drugs, insecticides and nets. The disease has already been eliminated in 15 countries since 2000. Global eradication once seemed impossible. Increasingly, it looks like a practical aim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>An assault on our rights</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6115/an-assault-on-our-rights#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Medical staff block Lambeth Bridge, London, during a climate protest. Credit: Alisdare Hickson" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Stop_Financing_Fossil_Fuels__51997248014_-credit-Alisdare-Hickson.jpg" height="1080" alt="A group of medical professionals block Lambeth Bridge in London to protest against fossil fuel extraction" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; went to press last week, the Public Order Act had just become law, introducing new police powers to restrict protests in the UK. It comes on the back of high-profile demonstrations in recent years that have seen groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Black Lives Matter take actions such as blocking roads, airports and printing presses in a bid to raise public awareness and push politicians into action. Some of the new restrictions came into effect just days before the coronation of King Charles III, ahead of anticipated anti-monarchy protests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government says it &amp;ldquo;fully supports the right of individuals to engage in peaceful protest&amp;rdquo; but that the &amp;ldquo;guerrilla tactics&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;serious disruption caused by a small minority of protestors has highlighted that more needs to be done to protect the public and businesses from these unacceptable actions.&amp;rdquo; But if Rishi Sunak and his party &amp;ldquo;fully support&amp;rdquo; the right to protest, they&amp;rsquo;re doing an impressive job of hiding it. They already introduced new restrictions last year, under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. That act increased the instances in which police could intervene in protests. Intentionally &amp;ldquo;causing a public nuisance&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; an offence which could cover peaceful actions like blocking the entrance to a building, or occupying a public space &amp;ndash; is now punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and the jailing of peaceful protesters has already begun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new law goes further again. It introduces new criminal offences, including &amp;ldquo;locking on&amp;rdquo;, where protestors chain themselves to buildings or objects, a tactic that was famously used by the suffragettes in the 1900s. That is now punishable by up to six months in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also newly criminalised are &amp;ldquo;obstructing major transport works&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;interfering with key national infrastructure&amp;rdquo; (the government has specifically mentioned airports and printing presses, both of which have been the sites of climate protests), and &amp;ldquo;tunnelling&amp;rdquo;, which is defined as &amp;ldquo;creating&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;being present&amp;rdquo; in a tunnel, &amp;ldquo;where such an act is causing or capable of causing serious disruption&amp;rdquo;. This last offence seems to specifically target anti-HS2 protesters, some of whom have occupied tunnels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law also allows magistrates to ban particular people from attending protests, and extends police powers, allowing officers to stop and search people without suspicion of any wrongdoing in and near protest sites. Under normal circumstances, police generally need to have &amp;ldquo;reasonable grounds&amp;rdquo; to suspect that someone is carrying an illegal item or something that could be used to commit a crime in order to stop and search them. Even then, the racial discrimination involved in that assessment of suspicion is well known and there is little evidence that it is an effective tool to fight crime. These efforts to pre-emptively clamp down on protests are deeply concerning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lords rejected some of the most serious provisions &amp;ndash; including a government bid to restrict the use of the right to protest on &amp;ldquo;an issue of current debate&amp;rdquo; as a defence in court. But this is not enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human rights organisations, and some politicians and lawyers, have condemned the law as an assault on democratic freedoms. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T&amp;uuml;rk, called on the government to reverse the legislation. The new law imposes &amp;ldquo;disproportionate criminal sanctions on people organising or taking part in peaceful protests,&amp;rdquo; he said, and is &amp;ldquo;wholly unnecessary as UK police already have the powers to act against violent and disruptive demonstrations&amp;rdquo;. Four UN special rapporteurs on rights have also expressed &amp;ldquo;grave concerns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is, unfortunately, little chance that the government will pay any attention to the international outcry. This regressive law is likely here to stay, with far-reaching consequences for our democracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Popular science books promise to uncover why we do it at all, while exploring its importance for a healthy life. Self-help manuals seek to teach the art of sleeping well amidst the stresses of modern life. Wearable devices and mobile apps monitor quality and quantity, nudging users to make adjustments to their bedtime routines. Meanwhile, last summer&amp;rsquo;s heatwave produced endless variations of top tips for ensuring the right amount of sleep in sweltering temperatures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These examples do not just point to an increased curiosity for an activity that, after all, makes up a third of our lives. Rather, they suggest a certain anxiety around sleep and a desire to master it. The key goal of Matthew Walker&amp;rsquo;s international bestseller &lt;em&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, was to demonstrate the importance of sleep to a society that, he argues, all too often neglects it with disastrous consequences for our health. That was published in 2018. Since then, the idea that our society may be experiencing a &amp;ldquo;sleep crisis&amp;rdquo; has become more popular, with reports that people&amp;rsquo;s sleep debt &amp;ndash; namely, the difference between the amount of sleep they need and the amount they actually get &amp;ndash; has been rising in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This concern over the number of hours people sleep, or fail to, has led to growing attempts at regimenting and optimising the night-time, be it through sleep-tracking, sleep-hygiene routines and sleep hacks, relaxation apps, or other assorted gadgets, from smart mattresses to smart light systems. Underlying these attempts is the sense that sleep should be harnessed. As one popular sleep-tracking wearable puts it: &amp;ldquo;Sleep more. Achieve more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this landscape, Alice Vernon&amp;rsquo;s new book &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It&lt;/em&gt; offers a breath of fresh air. Vernon highlights the need to widen our conversations around sleep beyond the anxious focus on maximising the number of hours we spend doing it. Her stories of troubled sleep purposefully steer well clear of the subject of insomnia &amp;ndash; a condition that has been the core theme of a recent boom of memoirs, such as Marina Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Insomnia&lt;/em&gt; (2018) and Samantha Harvey&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Shapeless Unease: A Year of Not Sleeping&lt;/em&gt; (2020).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, Vernon turns her attention to sleep disorders like somnambulism (sleepwalking), sleep paralysis and hallucinations. And of course, the titular night terrors: terrifying dreams which will typically cause the sleeper to scream and bolt out of bed, and which, unlike nightmares, the sleeper will typically not remember upon waking. Through exploration of these phenomena, &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; invites us to embrace the weirdness of sleep and to look more closely at aspects of our night lives that often thwart any attempts at control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gateway to consciousness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is many things at once: a vivid memoir of Vernon&amp;rsquo;s own experiences of troubled sleep, an accessible account of the science of the sleep disorders that are collectively known as parasomnias, and a rich cultural history of how these disorders have been interpreted and represented throughout the centuries. Such a fluid approach feels fitting. Sleep is both a subject of scientific research, about which we know more and more, and a phenomenon that can still elude our rationality and even fill us with utter horror, producing endless theories and fuelling the imagination. In skillfully weaving the strands of the book together, Vernon perfectly captures the liminal status of sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parasomnias, the focus of &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt;, are undesirable movements, perceptions, behaviours and emotions that arise as the brain transitions between REM (rapid eye movement) sleep &amp;ndash; the stage when dreams tend to occur &amp;ndash; non-REM sleep and wakefulness. These disorders, Vernon tells us, are quite common: 70 per cent of people experience a parasomnia at least once over the course of their life, typically sleep-talking or nightmares. She points out that the real percentage is probably even higher, given that a feature of some sleep disorders is that, upon waking, people do not have any recollection of what they have experienced during the night. What is more, people may be reluctant to talk about them: there is still a certain stigma attached to these &amp;ldquo;sleep demons&amp;rdquo;, which for centuries were explained away through the supernatural, or seen as a mark of insanity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; argues that we need to talk more about parasomnias, both to combat this stigma and to give voice to what these disorders tell us about ourselves. In Vernon&amp;rsquo;s impassioned writing, parasomnias emerge as an important gateway into different forms of consciousness, both individual and collective &amp;ndash; which we ignore at our peril. &amp;ldquo;Our little upheavals or our major traumas&amp;rdquo;, she writes, &amp;ldquo;can all come back through the trapdoor of sleep, so to ignore this part of ourselves can mean that we never really face what our dreams are telling us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader&amp;rsquo;s journey starts with the very first parasomnia that Vernon experienced as a child: sleepwalking. We then move on to hypnopompic hallucinations &amp;ndash; primarily visual hallucinations that manifest moments after waking up; think spiders scuttling on your pillow. Later on, we explore sleep paralysis, night terrors and, finally, dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A thread running through the book is the story of Vernon&amp;rsquo;s claustrophobic and manipulative relationship with a former teacher, whom she calls Meredith after mara, &amp;ldquo;an Old Norse word for a witch who would lie on people&amp;rsquo;s chests and try to suffocate them&amp;rdquo;. The mara is what we now know to be sleep paralysis, a parasomnia where the body&amp;rsquo;s inability to move &amp;ndash; preventing us from acting out our dreams and hurting ourselves or the people we sleep with &amp;ndash; continues after waking up. The person is lying down, fully awake and conscious, and yet entirely unable to move. Even screaming is impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a paradoxical and terrifying situation. In response, the brain can conjure up images of sinister figures looming over the sleeper and weighing them down, to explain the sensation of being pinned to the bed and the feeling of pressure on one&amp;rsquo;s chest and limbs. While Meredith&amp;rsquo;s oppressive hold on teenage Vernon is linked to a number of Vernon&amp;rsquo;s experiences of parasomnias, it is most clearly reflected in the sleep paralysis &amp;ldquo;demons&amp;rdquo; that populate her nights later on in her life. Vernon describes how, during sleep paralysis, she feels &amp;ldquo;crushed under the intense stare of Meredith, under her hands and her sharp nails&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sleep paralysis, nightmares and dreams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chapter on sleep paralysis is among the most engrossing. Beyond exploring the science of this parasomnia and providing memoiristic insights into the trauma that lies at the root of her own experiences, Vernon traces how the disorder has shaped paranoid beliefs across the ages. Looking at the historical records of the 17th-century Salem witch trials, for instance, Vernon learns how experiences of sleep paralysis generated several accusations of witchcraft in the trials. More recently, this parasomnia is thought to be the origin of many reports of alien abductions that supposedly happened at night and were accompanied by a peculiar heavy feeling. &amp;ldquo;What we see during sleep paralysis,&amp;rdquo; Vernon explains, &amp;ldquo;has changed significantly as our cultural depiction of monsters has shifted&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parasomnias seem to have always played a role in the cultural imagination. &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; is peppered throughout with insightful readings of historical paintings and texts, many of which are iconic, that draw on these strange and powerful phenomena. Vernon&amp;rsquo;s reflections on Dracula, the protagonist of Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s 1897 novel, note that he causes paralysis, somnambulism and night terrors in his victims. He was not just a vampire, she concludes, but &amp;ldquo;every parasomnia combined in the figure of a folkloric monster&amp;rdquo;. Just as vampires straddle life and death so do parasomnias &amp;ndash; during these sleep disorders &amp;ldquo;the waking, rational self is effectively &amp;lsquo;dead&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; The book goes on to illustrate how many of our famous writers, from Robert Louis Stevenson to Shirley Jackson, drew inspiration for their fiction from their real-life experiences of various parasomnias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not just that parasomnias can inspire creativity or that culture can help shed light on these strange sleep phenomena. Rather, Vernon argues that storytelling can have therapeutic potential when it comes to sleep. She points to the DreamsID project, a collaboration between sleep scientist Mark Blagrove and artist Julia Lockheart, in which participants share their dreams, nightmares and other parasomnias, whose findings seem to suggest that the process encourages empathy. Imagery rehearsal therapy is also discussed: a cognitive-behavioural treatment for reducing the number and intensity of parasomnias, where the patient is helped to reimagine their nightmares with different, less terrifying outcomes. There are also attempts being made to harness lucid dreaming, which allows people to be aware that they are sleeping and therefore lets them direct their own dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is something deeply liberating about &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; invitation to encounter sleep on its own terms, in all its weirdness and darkness. As Vernon writes, &amp;ldquo;sleep isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the number of hours, [or] the time it takes to nod off . . . Sleep is about stories. It&amp;rsquo;s about monsters, and ghosts, desires, aggression, trauma and anxiety, health, creativity, and the state of our inner lives.&amp;rdquo; Her book is a powerful reminder of what we miss when we think of sleep merely as something to master, in order that we might be more productive in the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alice Vernon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It&amp;rdquo; is published by Icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>See you in Hell</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Zagreus, your character in Hades" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Wallpaper_Zagreus01.jpg" height="1079" alt="The character Zagreus from Hades wear Ancient Greek-style clothing and carries a sword" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, as in life, death is inescapable. In the former, however, death is something you end up looking forward to. It takes a while to get used to; getting killed is usually the one thing you try to avoid in video games. It means you&amp;rsquo;ve failed, and that you have to start again. But in Supergiant Games&amp;rsquo;s 2018 offering, you can&amp;rsquo;t win the game unless you die again, and again, and again. Dying&amp;rsquo;s the whole point. It&amp;rsquo;s what makes you stronger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all, your character, Zagreus, is immortal. He is the son of Hades and he lives in Hell, but he wants out. That&amp;rsquo;s the premise. You grab a weapon, leave your chambers and run towards the surface. You fight your way through the worlds of Tartarus, Asphodel and Elysium, as your dad sends hordes of enemies to try and stop you. If Greek mythology is your thing, you will recognise many of their faces, from the Erinyes and the Lernaean Hydra to the double threat of Asterius and Theseus. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t, don&amp;rsquo;t worry: you&amp;rsquo;ll become acquainted with it soon enough. God, you&amp;rsquo;ll get acquainted with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will be killed by the Furies and killed by the three-headed monster; the king and his bull will kill you and send you down the river Styx, and you will wake up back where you began and you will start again. If it sounds tedious, please understand that it isn&amp;rsquo;t. &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; has won a dizzying number of awards and demand was such that it was eventually released on every single major gaming console.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was so successful, in fact, that Supergiant announced in December that a sequel is coming in 2023. In &lt;em&gt;Hades II&lt;/em&gt;, chthonic nymph Melino&amp;euml; will attempt to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time. In doing so, she will have to die again, and again, and &amp;ndash; you get the gist. The game is predicted to be one of the biggest indie releases of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Playing dead&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an unexpected turn of events. &amp;ldquo;Roguelikes&amp;rdquo;, as this genre of game is called, have been around for many years, but this is the first time one of them has hit the mainstream in such a way. What do I mean by &amp;ldquo;roguelike&amp;rdquo;? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s complicated. I can tell you that the name comes from &lt;em&gt;Rogue&lt;/em&gt;, an ASCII game released in 1980. I can tell you that the term was popularised in Usenet discussion groups in the early 1990s. I can tell you that any attempt to describe the concept fully and in a way that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t anger anyone would take the rest of this essay. Instead, and at risk of making many enemies among the genre&amp;rsquo;s purists, I will sum it up this way. A &amp;ldquo;roguelike&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; or &amp;ldquo;roguelite&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; is, to most people, a game that involves &amp;ldquo;permadeath&amp;rdquo;, i.e. losing means having to start again from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an unusual format. Video game files usually save at the beginning of a level or an encounter with a villain, meaning that dying is an annoying but relatively minor setback. In order not to be mind-numbingly repetitive, each roguelike &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo;, as the attempts to go through the game are called, is subtly different. Enemies appear in a different order, there are different rooms, or different weapons, upgrades and rewards to pick from. These are the basics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Hades_Aug19_04.jpg" height="1080" alt="A scene from Hades shows Zagreus navigating a green land" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, the games are often as rewarding as they are frustrating. You can play better than you ever had, then make one tiny mistake, one slip-up, and you are back at square one. This is presumably why roguelikes took their time to reach more casual gamers, who will only tolerate so much frustration in their pursuit of victory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; was a game-changer because it acknowledged its own reality. Zagreus knows he has died; when he crawls out of Styx, characters welcome him back and affectionately mock his failure. As a result, new subplots and lines of dialogue can only be unlocked by dying a number of times. Losing doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a failure because it isn&amp;rsquo;t one; it is the only way to progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It feels like a beautiful and heavy-handed parable, and a reflection on the very nature of roguelikes. As a more casual gamer myself, I was entranced by &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; and, once I finished it, sought out other games like it. I found &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Slay The Spire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first, I was an amorphous creature able to capture decapitated corpses and use them to fight my way out of a mysterious island, using whatever weapons I could find along the way. In the second, I flitted between being a monk, a soldier, a huntress and an automaton. Using &amp;ldquo;defence&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;attack&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;skill&amp;rdquo; cards, I faced enemies until I was able to escape from the tower I was held in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both games are more traditional examples of their genre. The character I am playing does not know they have been doing the same thing over and over again, or if they do, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter to the story. Instead, in them, I am Zagreus: the burden of knowledge falls on my shoulders. I may get the occasional upgrade but, on a fundamental level, the only thing that matters is my endurance, my willingness to fall, stand back up and go again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;One way out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only way to win is to become a better player, and the only way to become a better player is to keep playing until I know every inch of the game like the palm of my hand. I can only win by being able to predict the patterns of the various enemies, by knowing when I should attack and when I should retreat, by doing things without thinking because I have done them so many times already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also need to know and understand myself as a player: which weapon am I best at wielding? What are my weaknesses? How can I best make use of my strengths? It is a deeply personal &amp;ndash; and occasionally emotional &amp;ndash; endeavour. Like romantic love, roguelikes force you to witness, understand and cherish what is in front of you, what is within yourself and how the two interact with each other. They make you reckon with the importance of seemingly small details and the flaws you wish you didn&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also offer hope in a way that love doesn&amp;rsquo;t always, because they allow you to forget it all and start again. We&amp;rsquo;ve all longed to play god with our own lives, to go back to an interaction we had minutes or months ago and perform as a better version of ourselves. It is a desire that these games can fulfil. If you die at the hand of a monster who unexpectedly hit you twice instead of once at the start of a fight, you can dust yourself off, go back and move away as he prepares to hit again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, there is joy to be found in their familiarity. There is a point you reach with roguelikes, after 30, 50, 70 runs, when the game begins to feel like home. Everything is predictable and there are no surprises anymore. It feels like watching a movie for the hundredth time when stuck at home with a cold, or listening to your favourite songs if you are feeling stressed. Sometimes, nothing is as soothing as a controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the dark and gory nature of many of these games, it can lead to some amusingly absurd moments. I watched the trailer for &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; to jog my memory before writing this and sighed with warm nostalgia at the sight of Charon, who ferries souls into the Underworld. What can I say? We&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time together, he and I.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many other people did too; well over a million of them, in fact. Perhaps that is because they also found the real world, in all its stressful unpredictability, a bit hard to deal with. Retreating into a world of endless, sometimes hypnotising repetition can be a balm to the soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to think that they have also read about &lt;em&gt;Hades II&lt;/em&gt; and Melino&amp;euml; and look forward to getting to know her, as if she were a friend or a lover. If you&amp;rsquo;re one of them, there&amp;rsquo;s only one more thing I can add: I&amp;rsquo;ll see you all in Hell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Paris in Turmoil</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6110/book-review-paris-in-turmoil#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ET9KJR.jpg" height="1279" alt="A Parisian newsagent" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paris in Turmoil: A City Between Past and Future&lt;/strong&gt; (Verso) by Eric Hazan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paris in Turmoil: A City Between Past and Future&lt;/em&gt; is a slim book with wide horizons. Eric Hazan follows his more substantial &lt;em&gt;The Invention of Paris: A History in Footsteps&lt;/em&gt; (2010) with a condensed but fascinating series of vignettes, anecdotes and observations on aspects of Paris&amp;rsquo;s present and past. The daily life of citizens &amp;ndash; with all its tensions, pleasures, adventures and inequalities &amp;ndash; is placed centre stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is part of a strong tradition of urban writing that functions variously as cultural history, political critique and a kind of subversive tourist guide. Hazan takes conscious inspiration from this tradition, referencing Louis-S&amp;eacute;bastien Mercier&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Tableau de Paris&lt;/em&gt;, a monumental account of everyday life in the city that implicitly addressed social inequality and political tension on the eve of the French Revolution. Attending to the panorama of everyday life rather than the affairs of ruling elites, Mercier&amp;rsquo;s work influenced later novelists like Balzac, who appears in &lt;em&gt;Paris in Turmoil&lt;/em&gt; along with Victor Hugo and Charles Baudelaire. The book&amp;rsquo;s other antecedents include Walter Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s unfinished &lt;em&gt;Arcades Project&lt;/em&gt;, which tied the 19th-century construction of Parisian shopping arcades to the city&amp;rsquo;s wider cultural and political life, and the Situationists&amp;rsquo; development of the d&amp;eacute;rive or drift &amp;ndash; the experience of unplanned wandering and observation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paris in Turmoil&lt;/em&gt; applies and extends these traditions to the more recent changes wrought on 21st-century Paris, taking in the city&amp;rsquo;s art, architecture, commerce and culture as well as its politics. The book is notable for drawing out historical and sociological significance from the seemingly mundane: the changing clientele of certain caf&amp;eacute;s from students and Surrealists to hipsters and tourists; the varying density of tobacco shops as a marker of a neighbourhood&amp;rsquo;s class character; plus the changing ownership of these shops as a reflection of waves of migration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hazan&amp;rsquo;s focus on the detail, colour and texture of Paris has the effect of transporting you there: at a zinc caf&amp;eacute; counter, the window-display of a drearily upmarket boutique, or the bleak confines of the Boulevard P&amp;eacute;riph&amp;eacute;rique, the dual-carriageway that rings the city and &amp;ndash; in a familiar pattern &amp;ndash; separates the wealthy centre from its hinterland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inequality and frequently spectacular attempts to address it have long been associated with Paris, from the Jacobins and sans-culottes of the French Revolution to the barricades of 1832 and 1968, to the 2005 riots in the city&amp;rsquo;s poorer and racialised banlieues over youth unemployment and police harassment. Discussing the often reactionary politics behind urban planning, Hazan quotes the Situationist Guy Debord&amp;rsquo;s assertion that Paris &amp;ldquo;was ravaged a little before all the others because its ever-renewed revolutions had so worried and shocked the world&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book tracks the changes imposed on the city, both past and present, as a form of restriction or marginalisation, an attempt to impose control upon chaos &amp;ndash; notably Haussmann&amp;rsquo;s building of wide and straight avenues through districts like the &amp;Icirc;le de la Cit&amp;eacute;, whose raucous and lawless nature made them fertile ground for revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hazan notes how the effects of modernisation and gentrification continue to impact today&amp;rsquo;s marginalised groups: the city&amp;rsquo;s working class, homeless, refugees and migrant workers. Boundaries and limits are a recurring theme, with the often subtle or intangible restrictions they present undermining the city&amp;rsquo;s romantic potential for freedom and discovery. Importantly, too, the book offers ideas for improvement along with its criticisms, ranging from street names that better reflect the city&amp;rsquo;s artistic and political history to the practical development of traffic intersections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many aspects that Hazan identifies have clear relevance to other cities. The homogenisation of commercial centres, the rising rents driving poorer citizens to the city&amp;rsquo;s fringes or beyond, and urban gentrifiers known in Paris as bobos will all be recognisable to any recent observer of somewhere like east London. This is a book rooted in the author&amp;rsquo;s lifelong experience as a citizen, critic and obvious aficionado of Paris in particular, but it has wider application in the struggle to retain the radical and democratic past of life in cities which, as this book shows, can still be glimpsed beneath their contemporary gloss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
