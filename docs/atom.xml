<p class="lead">A few people in the state of Idaho really want to <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/capitol-watch/idaho-lawmakers-introduce-legislation-to-criminalize-those-who-administer-covid-vaccines-legislature/277-2436a514-e7da-4b31-9762-f9be10300075">arrest doctors and nurses</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two Idaho lawmakers have introduced a bill to charge those who administer mRNA vaccines with a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, and Rep. Judy Boyle, R-Midvale, sponsored HB 154. It was introduced in the House Health &amp; Welfare Committee on Feb. 15 by Nichols. According to the bill text, “A person may not provide or administer a vaccine developed using messenger ribonucleic acid technology for use in an individual or any other mammal in this state.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nichols has an associates degree in business administration; Boyle has attended college, no mention of a degree, and lists her occupation as “rancher.” Neither knows a lick about biology, obviously, but they’re trying to pass a law to criminalize a useful medical tool.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that they’re Republican. Also batshit nuts and ignorant.</p>
<p>I do appreciate that they added that “or any other mammal” clause to their law. At least they’re admitting that people belong to the mammalian taxonomic class! I suspect they just threw that in to make their wacky law sound sciencey.</p>

<p class="lead">Fox News is being sued for $1.6 billion by Dominion voting systems for their lies about voter fraud. <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/singham/2023/02/17/fox-news-personalities-are-craven-liars-and-other-non-news/">Mano has the story of how Fox News memos reveal that they <em>knowingly</em> lied</a>. Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham were presenting absolute lunatic Sydney Powell as a credible source on air, while saying behind the scenes that she was “lying,” “unguided missile,” “dangerous as hell,” “mind-blowingly nuts,” “totally off the rails,” “completely BS,” and “a complete nut.” Then they’d publicly treat her as a respectable source. They knew. They lied.</p>
<p>Also disgraceful: <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/fox-news-lawsuit-2659431124/">Maria Bartiromo, unhinged Trump fanatic, knew a few things about her sources</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Powell’s source … explained that she gets her information from experiencing something ‘like time-travel in a semi-conscious state,’ allowing her to ‘see what others don’t see, and hear what others don’t hear,’ and she received messages from ‘the wind,'” stated the lawsuit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real journalists, on hearing that their witness got their information from someone who claimed to have traveled in time while snoozing, would just close their notebooks, hang up or walk out, and refuse to use anything from that source ever. Not Bartiromo! She went live with it, not bothering to acknowledge that she got it all from a trippin’ loon.</p>
<p>Remember, nothing out of Fox News is journalism, it’s all dishonest propaganda. I hope they lose their lawsuit. Losing $1.6 billion would sting, but realistically, their wealthy billionaire backers will cover the loss and they’ll keep on poisoning the country with lies. We’re never going to pop that bubble as long as inequity allows the rich to trample the truth.</p>

<p>Or as long as one of our political parties is corrupt and willing to cover up the facts. Here’s an <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/07/31/mn-rep-matt-grossell-arrested-regions-hospital-accused-st-paul-cops-police-brutality-documents/">ugly local story about a Minnesota state representative</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the police reports, Grossell, 53, appeared intoxicated when he walked into the hotel bar at the Best Western Plus Capitol Ridge, known as the Kelly Inn, on St. Anthony Avenue near the state Capitol shortly after midnight on May 4. Like many lawmakers from Greater Minnesota, Grossell rented a room there while the Legislature was in session. [Hey, I’ve stayed at that hotel several times — I had no idea it was infested with politicians! –pzm]</p>
<p>After three more drinks, the bartender told police, Grossell slumped over a table. A hotel security guard was called over, and, according to a video footage reviewed by police, Grossell shoved the security guard five times, the fifth time being a two-handed shove that caused the guard to lose his balance. A “grapple” ensued, police reports state. The guard later said Grossell slapped him at one point but he was uninjured. The guard allowed Grossell to go to his hotel room.</p>
<p>The hotel called police. The guard said he wanted to press assault charges, and officers said hotel staff wanted Grossell evicted.</p>
<p>Officers found Grossell kneeling on the floor of his room. He was “unable to fully communicate.” Unsure if Grossell was having a medical episode, and believing he was unable “to care for himself,” a St. Paul police sergeant decided to have Grossell taken to Regions.</p>
<p>After investigators viewed security footage and interviewed witnesses, they cited Grossell for disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>According to the police reports, Grossell became “belligerent” at the hospital on several occasions, leading to an escalating situation that resulted in police arresting him for trespassing.</p>
<p>A nurse reported that Grossell was being “so disruptive in the pod that visitors and patients were being disturbed from their care, coming out of their rooms to see what had been going on,” one officer wrote. A doctor had concluded there was no medical reason to keep him there, and they needed him to leave so that other patients in the waiting room could be seen. Grossell was offered cab fare to take him home, but he refused.</p>
<p>The nurse told the officer that “Grossell referred to her as a ‘sick b—-‘ and told her to ‘get your head out of your ass.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>This unsavory and unpleasant person has been elected to state office twice. He serves on the House Public Safety and Criminal Justice Reform committee. He is, of course, a Republican. Notice how the state party responds to this news.</p>
<blockquote><p>Grossell, who sits on the House Public Safety and Criminal Justice Reform committee, among others, has faced no formal repercussions within the state Legislature. On Wednesday, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, declined to comment. As head of the Republican caucus, Daudt could effectively “discipline” Grossell by getting him removed from committees. House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, has the ultimate power over such things. She declined to comment Wednesday.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Republicans have no integrity or honor. Hortman, a Democrat, is also letting him escape with no consequences. And this is how we run the country?</p>

<p><q>Where is a person’s ‘gender identity’ located?</q> is such a goddamn <em>stupid</em> question. What is he, a phrenologist? The brain is a big messy association engine — you feed it a simple little word, like “woman”, and stuff is going to be firing all over the cortex, with signals ping-ponging all over the place. There isn’t a tight little kernel for each concept that can be localized to one discrete spot.</p>
<p>Even a dumb mindless text generator like ChatGPT can’t find a way to answer that question, so it does its usual game of pulling up and splicing together snippets of information, failing to find any sense in it. So Linehan refines his question — usually good idea, but in this case more revealing of his own biases than anything constructive. <q>How do we know we have a gender identity if we cannot locate it in the brain?</q></p>

<p>OK, Graham, how do you know where your car keys are, if you don’t know where the map is located in your brain? How do you know how old you are if you can’t find the perceptual clock in your cortex? Quick, tell me where the Irish accent is located — if you can’t give me a set of stereotaxic coordinates, then it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, he eventually found something to feed his sense of outrage.</p>

<p>This reminded me of a short ‘conversation’ I had on Twitter, where someone — a philosophy professor, no less — exposed how ignorant of logic he was.</p>

<blockquote class="creationist"><p>1. The sexes–male and female–have been around since before Saturn had rings.</p>
<p>2. Societies have not.</p>
<p>3. If something predates societies, then it cannot be a social construct.</p>
<p>4. So, the sexes–male and female– cannot be social constructs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s take that apart.</p>
<p>1. I don’t know how old Saturn’s rings are — apparently, <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/how-old-are-saturns-rings">there’s a lot of uncertainty</a> — but fine, this is a philosopher’s way of saying sex is really old. I’d agree, yeast have sexes, which is defined by a single mating type locus in the genome. So sex is at least as old as eukaryotes.</p>
<p>2. Now we are already getting on shaky ground. Define “societies”. Primates have cultures, patterns of behavior that are passed on by education and learning from generation to generation. We are plagued by the fuzziness of that “before Saturn had rings” nonsense, but to get around the difficulty of dealing with his even more poorly defined term of “societies”, I’ll agree, even though it might be that primate societies might be older than Saturn’s rings, we’ll have to wait for the astronomers to figure out. At least I can definitely agree that societies, broadly defined, are definitely younger than sexual reproduction and meiosis.</p>
<p>3. Kaboom, there’s the stupid leap of illogic. Sex evolves, it changes rapidly, and social definitions of sexual behavior change frenetically. We humans do not possess a single genetic locus that cleanly defines sex — we have piled on all these complexities and elaborations that are still essential parts of sex, and many of them are entirely cultural. We are more than MATa or MATα. The idea that men should have short hair and wear pants, while women should have long hair and wear dresses, is <em>entirely</em> a social construct. You cannot simply declare that because yeast have a specific sexual identity that can be localized to a single gene, that therefore everything about human males and human females must therefore be fixed and unaffected by fleeting social mores.</p>
<p>Sure, you can get me to agree in general with points 1 and 2, but with point 3 you’re suddenly endorsing the idea that Victorian ideas about sex and sex roles, for example, cannot possibly be social constructs because ancient eukaryotes could carry out meiosis. You think you’ve crafted an inescapable syllogism and have caught me, but really, you’re the one trapped.</p>
<p>4. False.</p>
<p>My conversation with Mr Bogardus did not last long, in particular because he was spectacularly dishonest for someone who teaches philosophy for a living. I told him a couple of times that my disagreement was with point #3, to which he would respond with ‘oh, so you don’t think #2 is true?’, which was infuriating. He didn’t care what I said, he had a logic trap he wanted to force me into, and any time I pointed out the hole in his reasoning, he’d try to invent a new conflict.</p>
<p>But then, that’s the way TERFs work: stupidity and lies are all they’ve got.</p>

    <title>I went to a party last night</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/02/18/i-went-to-a-party-last-night/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">It has been a long, long time, and I don’t think my brain can process it. I was a quiet little lump all night, like usual, but the sensory overload of a half dozen conversations going on at once always leaves me dizzy. I also stayed up later than usual, and slept in <em>until 7:30</em>. So this is what sybaritic decadence feels like…</p>
<p>I had made a big pot of jambalaya for the party, using my usual method. Oh, this requires peppers? Chop up every pepper in the house and throw it in. Onions? Same approach. Add two teaspoons of Cajun spice…are you mad? Heaping tablespoons. That’s not much, so double it.Then the usual Law of Garlic, you can’t add too much. Cooked it all up with a pound of rice and some Impossible Sausage (so it’s still vegetarian). Don’t forget the red pepper flakes and cayenne!</p>
<p>It came out pretty well — good flavor, a little bit of a kick but still mostly acceptable to a room full of Minnesotans.  Not too acceptable, I guess, because there were plenty of leftovers, but that’s OK. Guess what I’m having for breakfast this morning? It’s mighty fine, and it will wake a fellow up.</p>
<p>It better wake me up good, because I have an exam to grade, a problem set to assemble, one lecture to write and another to figure out what it’s talking about, spiders to feed and snuggle, and lots of dishes to do, both at home and in the lab. I’m home alone while Mary gets to frolic with a four-year-old, so it’s all on me.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Totally random, but I found this excellent summary of social media this morning.</p>

Is there any value to this unregulated research?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In 2015, at the age of 44, Parrish flew to Bogot&amp;aacute;, Columbia, to receive dozens of experimental gene therapy injections, with the goal of turning back her biological clock. By that time, she had founded her own company, BioViva. For her first public appearance as CEO, she had chosen to address the immortalist group People Unlimited, where she told a receptive crowd that she wanted to cure ageing, and do it fast enough that they could all benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;What dreams may come&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In our obsession with getting more sleep, we are overlooking the strange mysteries of night terrors and other parasomnias, writes Diletta De Cristofaro&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Vernon&amp;rsquo;s reflections on Dracula, the protagonist of Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s 1897 novel, note that he causes paralysis, somnambulism and night terrors in his victims. He was not just a vampire, she concludes, but &amp;ldquo;every parasomnia combined in the figure of a folkloric monster&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The temple of the body &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Weightlifters were once seen as freaks &amp;ndash; but now the fitness industry has taken over the world. Peter Salmon asks, how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In Christianity we are born with sin and spend our lives trying to repay that debt. In capitalism we must keep earning to stop our financial debt growing. This moral imperative is analogous with the prevalent framing of fitness today as an endless and unresolvable quest: one can always be fitter, and not pursuing this goal is a failing to oneself and to society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A: Anna Lembke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The program director of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Fellowship talks to &lt;strong&gt;J.P. O'Malley&lt;/strong&gt; about how to create a healthy pleasure-pain balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;What I have seen over two decades of clinical work is parents who have assiduously insulated their children not just from painful experiences, but really any kind of challenging experiences. This means that children haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to build up the mental strength they need to live in the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The spring 2023 issue of New Humanist is on sale now! &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt; for as little as &amp;pound;10 a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in this issue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2302-38-41-Jain-_1_.jpg" height="1064" alt="Indian widows are standing up for their rights" width="1596"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanket Jain &lt;/strong&gt;meets the women fighting back against India&amp;rsquo;s regressive widowhood traditions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen Stout&lt;/strong&gt; reports from Ukraine, where she joins the search for a missing writer taken by Russian forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt;Sometimes voters get it wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Eliane Glaser &lt;/strong&gt;asks why we find this so hard to admit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Euan Lawson&lt;/strong&gt; makes the case for drug consumption rooms, to tackle the UK's scandalously high rates of drug-related death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samira Ahmed &lt;/strong&gt;dives into the new trend for witch-lit.

    <title>Hunting for Vakulenko</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6083/hunting-for-vakulenko#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Mass graves in Izium, Ukraine" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2K1D0CX.jpg" height="667" alt="Mass graves in Izium, Ukraine." width="1000"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It was a beautiful, fresh October day in the pine forest near Izium, eastern Ukraine, when I walked among the empty graves, avoiding the discarded plastic gowns and gloves &amp;ndash; the Russian army trash. The sandy ground, once a place for picnics, was marred by gaping holes, splintered coffins, makeshift markers and spooled police tape. 447 people had been exhumed here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ahead and behind me, Ukrainian writers &amp;ndash; from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and elsewhere &amp;ndash; also lost for words, were moving slowly through the carnage. They had come, a &lt;br&gt;busload of them, to the recently liberated areas east of Kharkiv, looking for news of their colleague Volodymyr Vakulenko. Looking for grave 319, and hoping that the rumours were true, that he was never there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;He was a very special man,&amp;rdquo; his friend Maksym Bespalov told me, then immediately corrected himself. &amp;ldquo;He is a very special man. Idealistic.&amp;rdquo; They&amp;rsquo;d met more than a decade ago &amp;ndash; Volodymyr was hugely active in the literary scene, publishing almanacs and magazines, getting published himself and winning awards for his books and poetry, organising festivals and encouraging younger writers. He turned to children&amp;rsquo;s books after the birth of his son. Maksym tells me Volodymyr &amp;ldquo;tries to be everywhere, involved in everything. A little bit crazy, perhaps. But we like him because he is him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;What are his ideals, I asked Maksym. Without hesitation, he replied: &amp;ldquo;For all of the good versus all of the bad&amp;rdquo;. Volodymyr was an idealist; an outspoken, strident patriot who didn&amp;rsquo;t just write about the Ukrainian struggle but put himself on the line during the revolution of 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Those who loved and admired Volodymyr &amp;ndash; and there are many &amp;ndash; had hopes he was in a Russian prison, awaiting trial. &amp;ldquo;We all understand the most truthful version is that he is dead,&amp;rdquo; Maksym said bluntly. &amp;ldquo;But when we speak about Volodya, we always say that we hope he&amp;rsquo;s still alive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It was a hope shared by Olena Ihnatenko, the writer&amp;rsquo;s mother. Our next stop, once we&amp;rsquo;d made it through half-destroyed Izium and down cratered roads to the village of Kapytolivka, was Olena&amp;rsquo;s flat. She lives with her husband Vasyl and, now, Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s son Vitalik, who has autism and cannot speak. Volodymyr had hoped that the fact he was Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s sole guardian would mean the soldiers would leave him alone. He was wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Abducting a civilian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;We all crammed into the flat and sat on the floor around Olena and Vasyl, like schoolchildren being told a story. They described the bombardment, the month in a cellar, the freezing cold and near-starvation. Then the troops arriving in the bombers&amp;rsquo; wake. Volodymyr, who had been living with Vitalik and his own father elsewhere in the village, apparently ran out when the soldiers came, and shouted, &amp;ldquo;The rashists are here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rashist&amp;rdquo; is a neat portmanteau of Russian, racist and fascist that provokes ire in Russian soldiers: it expresses the widely-held Ukrainian view that Russians are now little different to Hitler&amp;rsquo;s forces, which also invaded at 4am, 81 years earlier. It was in keeping with Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s stubborn, proud and undaunted character that he would shout this as the invaders arrived. It was also incredibly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Vasyl, with pure white hair and bushy eyebrows, seems a kind, gentle old man; as he speaks to us he is calming Vitalik, stroking his shoulder and murmuring to him. Vitalik is rocking, agitated, staring at the strangers. He knows what&amp;rsquo;s going on, his grandmother insists &amp;ndash; just can&amp;rsquo;t express himself. The idea of this highly strung, nervous boy being seized by troops is almost incomprehensible. But on 22 March, that&amp;rsquo;s what happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s your nationalist?&amp;rdquo; a soldier nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Bes&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Demon&amp;rdquo;, had demanded of Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s elderly father. His men turned the house upside down looking for pro-Ukrainian literature. Volodymyr, sensibly, had hidden the flags he&amp;rsquo;d kept from his time on the Maidan &amp;ndash; Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Revolution of Dignity&amp;rdquo;, which overthrew corrupt ruler Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Both Volodymyr and Vitalik were taken to a nearby &amp;ldquo;special department&amp;rdquo; for a few hours, where Volodymyr was beaten, then both were returned home. Olena thinks it was probably a mistake that they took Vitalik. But Volodymyr knew they&amp;rsquo;d be back for him. It was at this point he took a shovel and dug a hole under the cherry tree in his father&amp;rsquo;s garden. He buried the notebook in which he&amp;rsquo;d been describing their life under occupation.&amp;ldquo;Give it to our guys [as everyone calls the Ukrainian Armed Forces] when they come,&amp;rdquo; he told his father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;A little later the soldiers returned, grabbed the writer while he was cooking on an open fire in the garden, and threw him into a bus on which they&amp;rsquo;d daubed their infamous invasion symbol, the latin letter &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The torture of not knowing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;For Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s ex-wife, Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s mother Iryna Novitska, the lack of information was unbearable. She lives in central Ukraine and had begged him, as everyone had, to get out while he still could. Their last communication was on 7 March when he&amp;rsquo;d called to say troops had entered the village. Then a message, later that night: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve wiped my phone contacts&amp;rdquo;, to protect their identities from the soldiers, in case he was picked up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The mobile networks were knocked out, one by one. Silence. Kapytolivka, like all the other villages and towns the Russians occupied, was swallowed up. It just disappeared into an information blackout for six long months. Relatives in free Ukraine had no idea if their loved ones in the occupied territories were hungry or fed, wounded or safe, imprisoned, scared . . . dead. Meanwhile, those inside the &amp;ldquo;dark zone&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t know what had become of the rest of the country. Propaganda from Moscow told them lies: Kharkiv has fallen, Kyiv has fallen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In the occupied towns, troops &amp;ndash; both from Russia and conscripts from the so-called &amp;ldquo;republics&amp;rdquo; of Donetsk and Luhansk &amp;ndash; roamed the streets, drunk and dangerous, searching men for &amp;ldquo;patriotic&amp;rdquo; tattoos, and taking them to torture cells, ten of which were later found in Izium alone. Informers were apparently active in the village. Volodomyr&amp;rsquo;s family suspect this is how he was picked up. Long before the invasion, he had predicted that the neighbours would turn him in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Throughout the spring and summer, 71-year-old Olena, struggling with the lack of food, medicine, gas, water and electricity, traipsed back and forth to checkpoints and distant military commanders&amp;rsquo; offices, searching for information about her son, and pleading with the Russians to let him go. The couple made written statements to the new &amp;ldquo;authorities&amp;rdquo;; detailed descriptions of Volodymyr and his arrest. The men promised they weren&amp;rsquo;t holding him; scoffed at the very suggestion. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not Nazis!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Some rumours reached her; that her Vovka was in Russia, awaiting trial. Or in a prison in occupied Donetsk. After the region was liberated in September, there was a terrible confusion over the mass grave lists: &amp;ldquo;Vakulenko&amp;rdquo; from Kapytolivka was listed. But no date of death was given, and authorities said it was a woman&amp;rsquo;s body in that pit. Could it have been a mistake? &amp;ldquo;I am living on hope,&amp;rdquo; Olena told me, that day in October. &amp;ldquo;I have to. He&amp;rsquo;s my only son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The Executed Renaissance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The idea that a children&amp;rsquo;s writer can be murdered because he believed in his own country is so absurd, so appalling, that you want to find another version of events to believe in. But actually, none of the writers I was with seemed surprised by what had likely happened to Volodymyr. Horrified, deeply angry, but not surprised. The killing of writers and artists, of creative people who shape a national culture, is nothing new in the grim history of Ukrainian&amp;ndash;Russian relations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Back in Kharkiv with the writers, I stayed one cold and eerie night in a building that stands as testament to Russia&amp;rsquo;s repeated attempts to wipe out Ukrainian cultural life: the House of the Word, or Slovo. Built in the late 1920s, it contained high-end apartments that accommodated Ukrainian writers and intellectuals. They were prized by the state in the brief period when Kharkiv was capital of Soviet Ukraine and had a flourishing literary scene. But then came the 1930s. The very idea of Ukrainian culture became anathema. In the countryside, Stalin killed millions with man-made famine, and in Kharkiv&amp;rsquo;s Slovo he killed the poets, playwrights and novelists. I lay awake in the dark listening to intermittent air-raid sirens and thinking of the night-time knocks from NKVD officers which preceded the execution of 33 of this building&amp;rsquo;s residents. But their senseless deaths &amp;ndash; many in a camp in northwest Russia &amp;ndash; did not prevent this group, known as the Executed Renaissance, from having a lasting influence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Victoria Amelina is their cultural descendant: a writer who vividly describes life, who is actively engaged in that old, old struggle to build a sovereign, free Ukraine. It was she who dug up Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s notebook in September, shortly after the Russians had fled Kapytolivka. She was in the area to document war crimes with an NGO. It took a few minutes of digging to find the little parcel. The day made a lasting, deep impression on her. &amp;ldquo;When you&amp;rsquo;re digging up the diary of a kidnapped writer from under a cherry tree, well &amp;ndash; you feel you&amp;rsquo;re somewhere in the 30s, when our writers were shot. Or in the 40s, under Nazi occupation,&amp;rdquo; she told a TV news crew covering the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Victoria [who was interviewed in the Summer 2022 &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt;] kept a little acorn from the garden that day, a physical memory, and was still carrying it in her pocket when we spoke in November. &amp;ldquo;You know they took literature from his room?&amp;rdquo; she asked me. &amp;ldquo;Books with blue and yellow, or the trident [the Ukrainian national symbol]. They took some as proof of his being Ukrainian, they equal this with &amp;lsquo;Nazi&amp;rsquo;. This is how genocidal logic works.&amp;rdquo; With the family&amp;rsquo;s permission she handed the diary to the Kharkiv Literary Museum for safekeeping. &amp;ldquo;The museum has manuscripts of writers from the Executed Renaissance period; it&amp;rsquo;s symbolic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;When I go to the museum, on a cold November day marked by power blackouts and snowfall, the curator, wearing white cotton gloves, gently pulls back the tissue paper and shows me the densely scrawled text, in black and red biro, scored out in places and spilling over into the margins. The very last line Volodymyr wrote in the diary he buried &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I believe in victory!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; is the same line I hear across Ukraine, day after day, week after week, as the war grinds on and people cling to their faith in their armed forces to drive out the occupier. Belief &amp;ndash; hope &amp;ndash; is non-negotiable. You must keep it, in order to keep going in the face of horror and terror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But hope can be terrible too. After the bodies from the mass graves were exhumed and taken to Kharkiv for analysis in September, the family were told to wait for DNA results. Olena still felt her son was alive. Nobody released from Izium&amp;rsquo;s many torture basements had seen Volodya that whole time. Perhaps he&amp;rsquo;d gone to prison?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In mid-November, while in Donbas reporting near the front line, I got a message from Iryna Novitska, Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s ex-wife. &amp;ldquo;Hope has turned to darkness,&amp;rdquo; she said simply. A photograph had emerged: gruesome, awful and irrefutably depicting Volodymyr before he was buried. Olena had seen it. It was all over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ukrainian journalists found the man who took the picture &amp;ndash; a local, tasked with collecting bodies and burying them in the pine forest during the occupation. He&amp;rsquo;d taken photos so relatives could identify the bodies later. Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s body had not been taken from a morgue or basement but from a spot by the side of the road where he may have lain for weeks. The body had bullet holes in the stomach and chest, from a Soviet-era &amp;ldquo;Makarov&amp;rdquo; pistol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Echoes of the past&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The next day I took a detour on the way back to Kharkiv, to see Olena one last time. She was heartbroken and furious, thinking back to those long months walking, exhausted, round the checkpoints for information. She recalled a meeting in April with a Russian commander, how he looked at the wall behind her, not meeting her gaze: &amp;ldquo;He said, &amp;lsquo;We&amp;rsquo;re looking, there&amp;rsquo;s no information&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and I knew then that he knew everything,&amp;rdquo; she said, shaking with anger. &amp;ldquo;Where my son was, what happened to him, everything. There was not the slightest point &amp;ndash; everyone knew, but no one was going to say.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s cartoons were playing in the background, and he was laughing at the TV. She hadn&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to tell him yet. He and Volodymyr were joined at the hip. It pained her that this boy was left without a father. She won&amp;rsquo;t be able to cope with his 24-hour-care for ever. Volodymyr used to joke with his mother that he&amp;rsquo;d live a long life, always taking care of Vitalik, going to a nursing home together in old age so they could be together for ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh and what have you done,&amp;rdquo; she cried suddenly, berating her son. &amp;ldquo;What have you done, oh God, oh my God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As a writer, his ex-wife Iryna said, Volodymyr &amp;ldquo;tried to say something in a way that no one had said before&amp;rdquo;. He loved the unusual, the amazing, the unique; his interests were wide-ranging, and though his heart and soul were in the Ukrainian fight, he made common cause with other people living under the shadow of Moscow&amp;rsquo;s empire: the Crimean Tatars, Armenians, Ichkerians, Belarussians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The investigation into who shot him and why will go on, as will countless others; a long slow reckoning that will never provide all the answers. But the soldiers who took Volodymyr were clear: it was his &amp;ldquo;nationalism&amp;rdquo; that made him guilty. So many stories like this have been uncovered, of Russian soldiers convinced by propaganda back home that Ukraine is a nest of Nazis. Stripping people and ransacking houses for &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; like blue and yellow ribbons, trident tattoos, books in their own language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Too often in this war, the echoes of the past are deafening: not just of the atrocities committed by the Nazis, but of Stalin&amp;rsquo;s terror the decade before that. We, in recent years, comfortably consigned all that to history, at least in Europe. The mass executions and jackbooted soldiers, the columns of tanks and sadistic torturers, informants and brave resisters, existed in a black-and-white era.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;To the Ukrainian woman digging up a diary of a disappeared children&amp;rsquo;s writer, just a few miles away from the heavy stench of mass graves, it is not history. Victoria Amelina thinks she knows why it&amp;rsquo;s happened again: there was never any reckoning for the Soviet Union&amp;rsquo;s crimes in Ukraine. And certainly no reckoning for what she calls the &amp;ldquo;annihilation of an entire generation of Ukrainian culture&amp;rdquo; in the 1930s: the execution of all those writers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As there were blacklists then, there are blacklists now, she concluded. Activists, influencers, people to be removed first. The Russians [according to Ukrainian authorities] came with 45,000 body bags. &amp;ldquo;But they expected to win the war in three days,&amp;rdquo; Victoria said. &amp;ldquo;So those thousands of body bags were for whom? For me, I guess, and everyone else like me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Bob Dylan on his Never Ending Tour" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/EBJ281.jpg" height="1075" alt="Bob Dylan does not intend to age gracefully" width="1596"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a footnote to his essay &amp;ldquo;The Uncanny&amp;rdquo;, Sigmund Freud recounted what might today be called a &amp;ldquo;senior moment&amp;rdquo;. Sitting one night in a private train compartment, he suddenly sensed the presence of an &amp;ldquo;elderly gentleman in a dressing gown and a travelling cap&amp;rdquo;. The intruder wasn&amp;rsquo;t a ghost &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re talking Freud here, not Jung &amp;ndash; but he was a spooky and unwelcome apparition nonetheless, and the psychoanalyst &amp;ldquo;thoroughly disliked&amp;rdquo; his appearance. So he decided to tell this stranger to scram but, when he looked again, he realised that there was no one there. His adversary was nothing more than his &amp;ldquo;own reflection in the looking glass&amp;rdquo;. Doh!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Among the indignities of growing old is a feeling of disconnection between the eternal self of the mind and the physical self in decline . . . I think. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know for sure because I&amp;rsquo;m only 41 &amp;ndash; a similar age to when the Jewish-born Bob Dylan recorded the unfocused yet daring &lt;em&gt;Shot of Love&lt;/em&gt;, his third largely Christian-themed album, back in 1981. If early middle age is still a time of peering around the bend to see what&amp;rsquo;s coming next, the slide towards old age is one of self-examination and settling accounts. Or so I gather from Dylan, who spent his forties in the 1980s promiscuously experimenting with world-views and audio production styles that were at odds with those of his first creative peak in the mid-1960s, only to drift back towards familiar ways and influences in the 1990s, then find mastery once again around the turn of the new millennium as a living museum-cum-R&amp;amp;D lab of traditional American musical forms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Now 81, Dylan is as vital an artist as he ever was &amp;ndash; indeed, more so &amp;ndash; as listening to his most recent collection of songs, &lt;em&gt;Rough and Rowdy Ways&lt;/em&gt; (2020), and reading his new book, &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of Modern Song&lt;/em&gt;, a collection of essays about 66 pop, blues and country tunes, should make abundantly clear. He is rock&amp;rsquo;s world-bending Prospero, in full command of a tempest of his own making, not its rain-soaked Lear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Yet the everyday tragedy of ageing is inescapable in his work. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently something that you can&amp;rsquo;t transcend even if you&amp;rsquo;re a Grammy-hoarding, Academy Award-winning Nobel laureate with a Pulitzer to boot and a body of work that will outlive us all. &amp;ldquo;How can a 17-year-old like me suddenly be 81?&amp;rdquo; the biologist Lewis Wolpert once asked. I wonder if Dylan asks himself this, too. Does he ever catch sight of an elderly gentleman in a dressing gown and a travelling cap in the dark windows of his tour bus and thoroughly dislike what he sees?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Not that it matters very much in the end. &amp;ldquo;Knowing a singer&amp;rsquo;s life story doesn&amp;rsquo;t particularly help your understanding of a song,&amp;rdquo; Dylan writes in his new book, and that&amp;rsquo;s true of a singer&amp;rsquo;s entire body of work, too. A preoccupation with the dying of the light, however, would explain why Dylan has raved with such exhilarating force at close of day, and why he has taken on a hard-bitten, film-noir-gangster-cum-bluesman persona that sticks two fingers up at those who seek autobiographical authenticity in his work, while offending many of his fans with its luridly macho provocations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;This is the misogynistic Dylan who, in a wild exegesis of the Eagles&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Witchy Woman&amp;rdquo;, indulges his fascination for &amp;ldquo;the progressive woman &amp;ndash; youthful, whimsical, and grotesque&amp;rdquo;. He&amp;rsquo;s the American psycho who fantasises about torturing to death a &amp;ldquo;hot-blooded sex starved wench&amp;rdquo;, ventriloquising the protagonist of Elvis Costello&amp;rsquo;s 1978 song &amp;ldquo;Pump It Up&amp;rdquo;. For the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist Jody Rosen, such passages diminish &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; by evoking an image of its author as a reactionary &amp;ldquo;elderly uncle who bulk-emails links to Fox News segments&amp;rdquo;. In the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;, Jude Rogers asks whether Dylan &amp;ldquo;included these rants because he enjoys the idea of staying provocative&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but she understandably finds some of it &amp;ldquo;gut-churning&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Upon first reading, I took all this to be of a piece with the folk- and blues-derived ultraviolence of late-period Dylan songs such as &amp;ldquo;Tin Angel&amp;rdquo;, a story of an adulterous wife that seems modelled equally on the traditional &amp;ldquo;Black Jack Davy&amp;rdquo; and Nick Cave&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Murder Ballads&lt;/em&gt;. For more than a decade now, Dylan has revelled in violence that mostly involves women &amp;ndash; perpetrated by them, inflicted upon them or at least attributed to them in some way. In &amp;ldquo;Nettie Moore&amp;rdquo;, a ballad of regret recorded in 2006, we glimpse Frankie from the folk song &amp;ldquo;Frankie and Albert&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; who murdered her cheating partner in a crime of passion &amp;ndash; merrily &amp;ldquo;raising hell&amp;rdquo;; in the 2000 barnstormer &amp;ldquo;Things Have Changed&amp;rdquo;, a woman with &amp;ldquo;assassin&amp;rsquo;s eyes&amp;rdquo; sits on the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s lap. The femme fatales in his songs are liable to draw first blood and give as good as they get. It&amp;rsquo;s a Robert Johnson-inspired world-view, best summed up by the mournfully sung line &amp;ldquo;There ain&amp;rsquo;t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,&amp;rdquo; from 2001&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Sugar Baby&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As troubling as such sentiments might be, these are genre trappings whose primary function is to elicit a raw emotional response. We&amp;rsquo;re not encouraged to take these lines as gospel, to be agreed with and followed, just as Johnny Cash didn&amp;rsquo;t expect us to go out and shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die. The title of Dylan&amp;rsquo;s new book suggests that his project is to impart a philosophy but it was probably chosen ironically, since anyone familiar with his work knows that its power lies in its irreconcilable contradictions. In his essay on Costello&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Pump It Up&amp;rdquo;, he explains, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s what a song makes you feel about your own life that&amp;rsquo;s important.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s why, I think, his work has always contained multitudes, why very little of it makes the literal, unified sense that compositions by more conventionally wordy songwriters (such as Leonard Cohen) do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;You can, of course, look at it all biographically. In 1978, Dylan recounted in a &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; interview how he had spent his 34th birthday at a gypsy festival in France, where he met the &amp;ldquo;king of the Gypsies&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;d had a heart attack before I&amp;rsquo;d come home to see him. All his wives and children had left . . . They smell death and they leave. That&amp;rsquo;s what happens in life. And I was very affected by seeing that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;So, Dylan has long associated old age with a loss of potency, and his fetishisation of violence might be a cartoonish response to that &amp;ndash; much like in all those action movies about elderly ex-secret agents with a particular set of skills and a barely concealed glee at whooping young butts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Even if that&amp;rsquo;s true, however, there&amp;rsquo;s clearly a lot more going on in both his recent songs and &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. In those lines about the Eagles&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Witchy Woman&amp;rdquo;, he slips on a Maga hat and bemoans &amp;ldquo;the progressive woman&amp;rdquo;, invokes the antisemitic trope of &amp;ldquo;the woman from the global village of nowhere&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; an odd thing to do for a guy who was raised Jewish &amp;ndash; and suggests that the only response is to &amp;ldquo;put on the skin of a lion&amp;rdquo;, echoing Mussolini&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep&amp;rdquo;. A few lines later, however, he describes people who hold such views in the most withering terms: &amp;ldquo;Now you&amp;rsquo;re a self-admiring, unchivalrous fellow with an evil nature.&amp;rdquo; If you nodded along to the woman-hating paranoia, you&amp;rsquo;ll realise pretty soon that the joke&amp;rsquo;s on you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Here is the trickster who threw fictional characters and even Sharon Stone into &lt;em&gt;Rolling Thunder Revue&lt;/em&gt;, his 2019 collaboration with Martin Scorsese that looks like a documentary but is, as its subtitle makes clear, just another &amp;ldquo;Bob Dylan Story&amp;rdquo;. Make of all this what you will, because he offers no unequivocal answers. That, I think, is the point: to make listeners and readers witness the unfolding of their own thought, rather than try to analyse him like an amateur Freud in search of second-hand truths. As he once sang, long ago: trust yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New hope for less controversial Alzheimer’s drug</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6075/new-hope-for-less-controversial-alzheimers-drug#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;img title="Histopathology of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Histopathology_of_amyloid_plaque_in_Alzheimer_s_disease.jpeg" height="576" alt="Amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease" width="780"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In 2021 the drug Aducanumab became the first new treatment for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 20 years. But it was surrounded by serious questions over the design, analysis, efficacy and safety of the underlying trials, as well as the conduct of the FDA itself (see &lt;em&gt;New Humanist &lt;/em&gt;Autumn 2021).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Like many drugs in the pipeline, Aducanumab targets build-ups of the beta-amyloid protein, known as &amp;ldquo;plaque&amp;rdquo;, in the brain. The hypothesis is that this plaque collects between neurons and disrupts their normal function, playing a causal role in the development of AD. Whilst the theory has been the basis of decades of research, scientists remain divided over its validity. The controversy surrounding Aducanumab&amp;rsquo;s approval did little to settle the debate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Then, in late 2022, a clinical trial reported significant results in targeting the &amp;ldquo;brain plaque&amp;rdquo; so central to this hypothesis. A new compound, Lecanemab, was again approved under an accelerated procedure by the FDA. However, the results of the trial, published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, have largely been received with greater hope and confidence than the Aducanumab debacle. They appear to provide evidence for the first time of both significant reductions in plaque and, crucially, a slowing in the rate of decline in cognition by 27 per cent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;We are yet to find out who might benefit. Treatment with the drug requires two weekly transfusions and will cost over $25,000 per patient per year in the US. In the UK, medical regulators are yet to announce their timeline for considering Lecanemab (they never gave the green light to Aducanumab).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Excitement has also been muted among researchers due to concerns over adverse events. The drug has only been trialled, so far, in early-stage AD patients and some experts say it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely to help those who are further down the line. However, there is still cause for optimism. If Lecanemab is approved, it would be the first time a drug is made available to AD sufferers that targets the cause of the disease, rather than the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This article is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Tracking the anti-abortion backlash</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6078/tracking-the-anti-abortion-backlash#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="'40 Days for Life' campaign outside the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) offices, London." src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Bedford_Square_anti-abortion_protestors.jpeg" height="865" alt="'40 Days for Life' outside the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) offices, London." width="1472"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The image of religious protesters outside an abortion clinic &amp;ndash; holding candles and praying, or shouting at young women while brandishing gruesome posters &amp;ndash; conjures a particular place. We think of the United States. Not everyone knows that this kind of scene also plays out in the UK. Efforts are now being made to protect British women seeking to exercise their reproductive rights. This has created a backlash from anti-abortion protestors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Buffer zones are areas outside clinics providing abortion, implemented to prevent women from being abused and harassed on their way in and out. In Northern Ireland, a bill to make it a criminal offence to protest within 150 metres of any clinic is currently passing through parliament. In December, the UK&amp;rsquo;s Supreme Court ruled that while the bill did restrict protesters&amp;rsquo; rights, these restrictions were justified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The court acknowledged that the case was &amp;ldquo;highly sensitive&amp;rdquo; but stated that the women accessing abortion services &amp;ldquo;have a reasonable expectation of being able to do so without being confronted by protest activity designed to challenge and diminish their autonomy and undermine their resolve.&amp;rdquo; It took into account that clinic staff could also be intimidated, harassed and abused. Legislation is also now passing through parliaments in England and Wales, and is being considered in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The president of the American anti-abortion campaigning group 40 Days for Life responded to the Supreme Court ruling with a video promising immediate action. This is a US-based group, but it is active in Northern Ireland and Scotland. In September 2022, the group organised a six-week &amp;ldquo;prayer vigil&amp;rdquo; targeting clinics in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee and Falkirk. It is just one of several anti-abortion groups who strongly oppose buffer zones, framing it as a free speech issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The first legally enforced buffer zone in the UK was created in 2018 in the west London area of Ealing. Soon after this, the government rejected calls for nationwide buffer zones in England and Wales. Since then, 50 clinics have been targeted by anti-abortion protesters in England and Wales, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS). But there are presently only five buffer zones in England, including in Bournemouth, where the director of anti-abortion group March for Life Isabel Vaughan-Spruce was arrested outside a clinic in December.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Clare Murphy, BPAS chief executive, said: &amp;ldquo;Anti-choice groups routinely follow women and healthcare professionals as they enter and leave clinics, display graphic banners of dismembered foetuses, and tell women that if they terminate a pregnancy, they risk breast cancer and long-term mental illness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The level of resistance and organisation from anti-abortion groups indicates that even if the new laws go through, and more buffer zones are created, this will not be the end of the fight. It&amp;rsquo;s one that we must win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This piece is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2022/04/26/the-results-are-in/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;
