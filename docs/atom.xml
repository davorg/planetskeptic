Racism was a social sport upper-class men played to solidify a professional identity rooted in whiteness (figure 1). These heinous ‘educational’ activities included torturing enslaved black people with ‘experiments’, graverobbing their bodies from cemeteries and attempting to detect whether they were faking illness while torturing them as ‘treatment’ (Willoughby 2016). This white supremacy persisted long after legalised slavery ended. The 1910 Flexner Report closed five of the seven black medical schools, preventing 35 000 black physicians from graduating in subsequent decades, amidst deadly black–white health inequities (Campbell et al. 2020). The American Medical Association (AMA) sanctioned this disregard for humanity, banning black physicians from local AMA chapters through the 1960s, thereby denying licensing, board certification and hospital privileges (Baker et al. 2008). This anti-black racism was nothing new. During the early twentieth century, organised medicine cultivated a symbiotic relationship with the Ku Klux Klan, promoting its white supremacist conceptions of race, gender, and sexuality and their related violence (Antonovich 2021). White psychiatrists diagnosed black men protesting during the Civil Rights movement with a dangerous ‘protest psychosis’. Pathologising black people’s resistance to oppression while normalising white people’s violently oppressive behaviour is a long historical arc. It is reflected in diagnoses like drapetomania from the mid-nineteenth century and the overdiagnosis of conduct disorder in racially minoritised children today (Metzl 2010).</p></blockquote>
<p>That photo is genuinely horrible and shameful. The account is true, every word, and damning. Yet the article that was from <a href="https://twitter.com/bschillace/status/1680175064522584064">triggered outrage from medical institutions</a>. It shouldn’t. I like this comment from Dr Brandy Schillace, about how they <i>should</i> respond:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s how we build. That’s how we have real conversation and community. There is amazing relief, Grace, growth, in admitting we are wrong AND acknowledging that the wrong has deeply hurt others. Then both apology and amendment will be genuine, and accepted as such. </p>

    <title>Ken Ham is a disingenuous fraud on climate change</title>

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sorry, I feel stupider for having read this: it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://answersingenesis.org/environmental-science/did-earths-temperature-break-records-this-summer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ken Ham talking about climate change&lt;/a&gt;. He reports the headlines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the Fourth of July weekend here in the US, headlines proclaimed: “For the third day in a row, Earth&amp;#8217;s average temperature breaks record highs.” Last week on July 5, 2023, the average global temperature (according to one university’s “Climate Reanalyzer,” “a tool that uses satellite data and computer simulations to measure the world’s condition”) was a record 62.8 degrees Fahrenheit (or 17.18 C), beating the “record” set on Monday. But is this really a record?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ol&amp;#8217; Ken questions it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;…was last week really a record? Well, it might have been—but we don’t really know! Humans have only been recording climate data since the 1880s, and we’ve only had robust data since satellite data collection began in the 1970s. So we have no idea how warm the warmest day on earth was in all of the earth’s history! (But we do know, based on the fossil record, that the earth’s climate was much warmer before the flood!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You idiot. We have over a century of robust climate &lt;em&gt;records&lt;/em&gt;, and this was the highest temperature &lt;em&gt;on record&lt;/em&gt;, therefore, yes, it was a &lt;em&gt;record&lt;/em&gt; high temperature. Words mean things, you know. They weren&amp;#8217;t saying this was the hottest the planet had ever been &amp;#8212; that probably occurred about 4&amp;frac12; billion years ago, when the planet was a molten ball of rock &amp;#8212; but the hottest since we humans have been carefully tracking the climate. OK, you fucking stupid charlatan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he goes on to top that disingenuous word game. He claims that he &lt;em&gt;believes in climate change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do I believe in climate change, but I’m a climate change alarmist, and I do believe humans have caused climate change! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except…just not the way scientists do, with their measurements and data and records. No, he believes in a coming Biblical catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m not referring to a supposed slight global temperature increase allegedly caused by humans burning fossil fuels. I’m referring to the ultimate catastrophic climate change everyone should be aware of when one day in the future, Jesus will return, and the earth (and the whole universe) will be judged with fire, and God will make a new heavens and earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then goes on to say that &lt;q&gt;humans are the cause of this coming catastrophic climate change,&lt;/q&gt; because of our &lt;q&gt;sin in Adam&lt;/q&gt;…except he then goes on to say that we&amp;#8217;re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, man is not going to destroy the earth! We can boldly proclaim that humans aren’t going to destroy themselves or the earth because God is in complete control, and he will determine when the ultimate catastrophic climate change will occur. So, the climate change countdown clock is absurd! We need to understand and believe in climate alarmism in a biblical context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bait-and-switch game AiG plays all the time. They have multiple articles with titles like &lt;q&gt;Science Confirms Climate Change&lt;/q&gt; and &lt;q&gt;The Globe Is Warming, But It&amp;#8217;s Not Your Fault!&lt;/q&gt; and &lt;q&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a Climate Change Alarmist!&lt;/q&gt; that, when you actually read them, are denying all the scientific evidence in order to claim that the basis of their belief rests entirely on Bible prophecy, and that, of course, the way to prepare for climate change is to pray and go to church and give Answers in Genesis your money. The only reason you should worry about environmental catastrophe is if you don&amp;#8217;t fear God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, I despise these liars.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">I saw this dog’s breakfast of a movie last night. Hated it.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s got a macguffin, a cruciform key that <em>somehow</em> will give the person who uses it control of an AI that can crack all of the intelligence agencies in the world. It does nothing in this movie. It’s just a small metal object that everyone has to chase, endlessly.</li>
<li>
<p>It has the most boring villain ever. A handsome man named Gabriel who, apparently at the behest of the AI, appears to stand handsomely in the middle of the action, doing pretty much nothing, except it turns out he’s a great knife-fighter in one scene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are car chases. They’re pointless exercises in <em>chasing</em> — they’re only motivated by the fact that someone has the macguffin, and someone else wants it. You want car chases? Go watch <a href="https://amzn.to/3JZHjsW"><i>Baby Driver</i>, which does them well and integrates them into the story.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a fight scene on top of a runaway train. Of course there is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ving Rhames is the stereotypical movie hacker. He doesn’t do anything but make portentous statements and announce that he’s going to hack a computer. He wiggles his fingers magically. Don’t worry, no one involved in writing this movie understands computers or hacking or AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my god, the <em>writing</em>. It’s terrible. For instance, there’s a scene where a room full of intelligence bureaucrats who are reciting a summary of the problem. The thing is, it’s a series of sentences, and the individuals go around the room with each one saying one sentence in turn. People don’t talk that way. There are multiple scenes where the dialog is clumsy and unrealistic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a stupid scene where Simon Pegg is sent on a side-quest to neutralize a tiny nuclear bomb. It turns out to be a puzzle game, with riddles. It’s like something you’d find in a video game. And then it turns out to be a fake bomb. The whole scene could have been cut without affecting the movie at all, except that they needed to give Pegg something to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The masks. I hate the fucking stupid masks, and the obligatory scene where a character pulls off a thick rubbery latex mask to reveal that he was some other character. Masks can’t do that, they’ll fool no one, but it’s a thing in these movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tom Cruise, running. Running, running, running. He never arrives at a fight out of breath, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are stunts done for the sake of being stunts. The stupid mask machine burnt out, so Tom Cruise can’t just disguise himself and walk onto a train, he instead chooses to jump off a mountain in a motorcycle and parachute into the moving train. Yeah, much more subtle and sneaky. No one will notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is two hours and forty three minutes long, and it’s just part one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next movie, they already have the macguffin part one, so macguffin part two will be a sunken submarine beneath the arctic ice cap, where the AI exists. I don’t care.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The best thing about <i>Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning: Part 1</i> is that it cured me of any desire to see <i>Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning: Part 2</i>. Too late. It’s going to make a derailed train car falling off a cliff full of money.</p>

    <title>The George Floyd murder only exposed a deeper rot in Minnesota</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/07/14/the-george-floyd-murder-only-exposed-a-deeper-rot-in-minnesota/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/doj.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/doj-148x150.png" alt="" width="148" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-70722" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/doj-148x150.png 148w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/doj.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 148px) 100vw, 148px"/></a></p>
<p class="lead">The Minneapolis Police Department has received some, shall we say, rather negative press for a series of ugly incidents — not just the George Floyd murder, but also other outrages. So the United States Department of Justice carried out an investigation. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1587661/download">results have been released</a> in a 92 page document. It’s not pretty. Here is the summary of the major conclusions.</p>
<blockquote><p>FINDINGS<br/>
The Department of Justice has reasonable cause to believe that the City of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Police Department engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives people of their rights under the Constitution and federal law:</p>
<ul>
<li>MPD uses excessive force, including unjustified deadly force and other types of force.</li>
<li>MPD unlawfully discriminates against Black and Native American people in its enforcement activities.</li>
<li>MPD violates the rights of people engaged in protected speech.</li>
<li> MPD and the City discriminate against people with behavioral health disabilities when responding to calls for assistance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We like to think that Minnesota is a pretty good place to live — good schools, progressive politics, relatively good cost of living, etc., etc., etc. — but that only applies if you’re white. The report also documents some of our deeper problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>Not everyone in Minneapolis shares in its prosperity. The metropolitan area that includes Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul—known as the Twin Cities—has some of the nation’s starkest racial disparities on economic measures, including income, homeownership, poverty, unemployment, and educational attainment. By nearly all of these measures, the typical white family in the Twin Cities is doing better than the national average for white families, and the typical Black family in the Twin Cities is doing worse than the national average or Black families. The median Black family in the Twin Cities earns just 44% as much as the median white family, and the poverty rate among Black households is nearly five times higher than the rate among white households. Of the United States’ 100 largest metropolitan areas, only one has a larger gap between Black and white earnings.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you’re wondering how we ended up this way…</p>
<blockquote><p>Some researchers have traced Minneapolis’ homeownership gap and other economic disparities back to the restrictive racial covenants that barred non-white people from living in many parts of Minneapolis in the first half of the 20th century. Beginning in 1910, local and federal public officials and mortgage lenders embraced racial covenants, and lenders engaged in redlining by routinely denying loans for properties in majority Black or mixed-race neighborhoods. The racially restrictive covenants, which the Supreme Court sanctioned in 1926 but later ruled unenforceable in 1948, funneled the City’s growing Black population into a few small areas and laid the groundwork for enduring patterns of residential segregation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s as if there is an effect of history that is harming current generations, and a deep institutional racism routinely propped up by the courts.</p>

<p class="lead">Stop me if you’ve heard this before…oh wait. If you’ve read this blog before you’ve <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/01/29/islamic-science-has-come-to-this-pitiful-end/">encountered</a> this <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/07/15/another-silly-scientific-claim-from-islam/">phenomenon</a> in the past. There is a strange cottage industry among Muslim fanatics to demonstrate the infallibility of Mohammed by testing one of his weirder claims. This one:</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Over a thousand years ago Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him) said “if a fly falls down on your vessel, drown it then remove it, for one of its wings has the ailment and other has the cure” narrated by Al-Bokhari. In this study 4 flies of (<i>Musca domestica</i>) species were collected to investigate the antibacterial and antifungal activity of their wings. The obtained result showed that all media cultivated with right wing extract were free of bacterial and fungal growth however the bacterial and fungal growth for the left wing were observed. It could be concluded that the right fly wing is considered as new revolution of antibiotic recommended for further researches to find more antibiotics from right fly wing.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s from an article with the ungrammatical title, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337926012_Microbiological_studies_on_fly_wings_Musca_domestica_where_disease_and_treat">Microbiological Studies on Fly Wings(Musca domestica) Where Disease and Treat</a>. I guess the World Journal of Medical Sciences does not exercise any editorial oversight at all, and their review process is a bit of a joke. The paper itself is incredibly bad, of a quality that would earn a failing grade if it were presented as a middle school science fair project. I mean, seriously — here’s the <em>entirety</em> of the results section (with a bit of the introduction and methods).</p>
<div id="attachment_70716" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/fly-experiment-result.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/fly-experiment-result-500x389.png" alt="" width="500" height="389" class="size-large wp-image-70716" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/fly-experiment-result-500x389.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/fly-experiment-result-150x117.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/fly-experiment-result-300x233.png 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/fly-experiment-result.png 694w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pic. (1), (2) and (3) illustrated that there were no bacterial or fungal growth in test tubes containing the right fly wing extract however there were microbial growth in 4 test tubes for left wings extract indicated by turbidity which had been confirmed by microscopical examination, the slides for the right wings extract were free for the presence of any microbe although the slides for the left ones showed presence of both bacteria (cocci and bacilli) and fungi (hyphea)</p></div>
<p>That’s it. That’s all. Do you believe any of it? It’s not just the lack of believable data, but the introduction is full of obvious nonsense.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Wooden shamanic totems in Siberia. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/shamanism-sq.jpg" height="1368" alt="Wooden shamanic totem poles in Siberia" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rhonda McCrimmon, from Dundee, has 180,000 TikTok followers. Some of them are doctors, others are teachers, lecturers or social workers. They are all looking for spiritual guidance. McCrimmon is a self-styled Shaman, and posts videos on connecting with spirit guides, power animals and cauldron healing. &amp;ldquo;One of the beautiful things about Shamanism is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from anywhere,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;It just is, and has existed for as long as anybody knows. It is not exclusive to one culture or ethnicity.&amp;rdquo; She is popular, with more than 1.5 million TikTok likes, and expensive too &amp;ndash; charging clients &amp;pound;3,500 for Shamanic practitioner courses lasting 20 months. Yet a growing body of opinion would question whether she knows what she is talking about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Shamanism has drawn attention, attracting celebrity followers including Jennifer Lawrence and Daniel Craig. In November, Princess Martha of Norway quit royal duties to focus on a Shamanic healing business with her Shaman fianc&amp;eacute;. And this interest is set to increase, if the 2021 UK census is a benchmark. It showed that over the past decade, there has been a 12-fold increase in British people stating their religion as Shamanism, from 650 in 2011 to 8,000 in 2021. Notably, this did not involve ticking a box, but writing their religion into a free-text space. Other nature-based religions also grew, but did not get the same traction. Paganism, which has European roots, increased its adherents by a quarter. The number of Wiccans grew by nearly 8 per cent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behind the headlines, however, Shamanism&amp;rsquo;s complex origins are surprising and rarely understood. Dr Susannah Crockford is a senior lecturer in anthropology at the University of Exeter. She says that the word &amp;ldquo;Shaman&amp;rdquo; originated with the Tungusic people of Siberia and referred to that community&amp;rsquo;s Indigenous spiritual practitioners. When the Russian conquest of Siberia occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries, Europeans returned to their homelands with stories of Shamans. &amp;ldquo;But in a very racist fashion, they laughed at them,&amp;rdquo; says Crockford. &amp;ldquo;The image of the Shaman became known in European literary circles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the 20th century, and European anthropologists were observing and writing about other cultures. On seeing Indigenous spiritual practitioners in other parts of the world, they labelled them all &amp;ldquo;Shamans&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;They used this word to describe spiritual practitioners across North America, South America and south-east Asia,&amp;rdquo; Crockford says. &amp;ldquo;None of these people used the word Shaman themselves, it was a colonial imposition on global practices that had Indigenous names. That is why you will find a broad diversity of practices under this label &amp;lsquo;Shamanism&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The bibles of western Shamanism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For western Shamans, Indigenous spiritual practices from around the world have been conveniently &amp;ndash; and questionably &amp;ndash; condensed into two books that serve as the bibles for their beliefs. In 1964, the Romanian historian Mircea Eliade published Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy. Differing Indigenous spiritual practices were merged in this book, yet it developed a following in 1960s America. It was another book, however, which became the blueprint for Shamanic practice in western societies. In 1980, the American anthropologist Michael Harner published The Way of the Shaman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Harner translated the Indigenous religions as he understood them, and then mashed them together,&amp;rdquo; says James L. Cox, emeritus professor of religions at the University of Edinburgh, who has a specialist research interest in Indigenous religions. &amp;ldquo;Harner turned Indigenous practices &amp;ndash; which tended to be about solving community problems, for example, a lack of rain or another person&amp;rsquo;s illness &amp;ndash; into an individualistic practice. In this western 1980s version of Shamanism, you could go to a weekend workshop and discuss your personal problems . . . It is a form of modern therapy where you discuss yourself in a group.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harner describes &amp;ldquo;trance&amp;rdquo; as key to unlocking the insights of western Shamanism. In this altered state, the individual is alert but experiences ecstasy through drumming, rattling, dancing and singing &amp;ldquo;power songs&amp;rdquo;. Later on in the book, readers are guided to communicate with rocks to solve their life problems: by picking up a big stone, asking it a question, and then watching it for visions. According to Harner Shamans in the west can also find their personal &amp;ldquo;power animal&amp;rdquo; by shaking a rattle and dancing like an animal of their choice. He writes that Shamans should &amp;ldquo;experience the emotions of the animal, and don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to make the cries or noises of it, if you experience the desire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book relies heavily on detailing the practices of North American and Amazonian tribes. In the opening, Harner recognises this, but adds that those who follow the techniques will not be simply &amp;ldquo;playing Indian&amp;rdquo;, but having the same &amp;ldquo;revelatory&amp;rdquo; experience, based on &amp;ldquo;methods learnt from South and North American Indians&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shannon O&amp;rsquo;Loughlin is a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, in the United States, and CEO of the Association on American Indian Affairs. &amp;ldquo;Shamanism itself is a colonial word. It is a misrepresentation and appropriation of Indigenous world views,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;The taking of Native ceremonies and using them for commercial or ego-driven practices is harmful to Native Nations, and to those non-Native persons using them without consent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Power animals and lunar energies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Karen Ward disagrees that her Shamanic practice culturally appropriates. She is a doctor of philosophy at Dublin City University, a psychotherapist, and identifies as an Irish Celtic Shaman. &amp;ldquo;If you can trace your lineage to something then you&amp;rsquo;re not appropriating,&amp;rdquo; she says, adding that &amp;ldquo;people should namecheck the traditions they use&amp;rdquo; in order to acknowledge their origins. &amp;ldquo;For me, Celtic Shamanism can be practised by going to Stonehenge on winter solstice, working with lunar energies, or by sitting in a circle &amp;ndash; where there is no priest or hierarchy &amp;ndash; and connecting with each other, and really listening to one another, giving another person in my circle that time. My ancestors would have done these things, I can trace my lineage back to all these traditions and not appropriate other cultures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there is little evidence of such ancient European practices, according to both Professor Cox and Dr Crockford. &amp;ldquo;People will call themselves Celtic Shamans,&amp;rdquo; says Crockford. &amp;ldquo;But it is very sketchy archaeologically and historically. We do not know that Druids existed, let alone their spiritual beliefs. So to reconstruct this as an ancient religion is an imaginative process. A lot of the practices that you will find in Celtic Shaman circles are strikingly like those detailed in Eliade and Harner&amp;rsquo;s books.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crockford notes that spirituality has taken off on social media. WitchTok is a spiritual community on TikTok that has received billions of views. &amp;ldquo;Just look at WitchTok,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Combined with the celebrity influence, it has become trendy. Those charging for Shamanism courses are like influencers. They are on the same channels &amp;ndash; YouTube, Instagram, TikTok. They will get money from ad revenue, and sell spiritual readings over Zoom and Facebook groups. Look at who takes these [courses] and who is making money, though. You cannot help but notice, it is usually white, English-speaking, middle- or upper-class people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Loughlin adds that name-checking is not enough. &amp;ldquo;Simply naming, &amp;lsquo;I have stolen this from Native Peoples&amp;rsquo; does not resolve or mitigate the harm,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Alleged traditional teachings from books, websites or from non-Native Peoples are simply not authentic. The value of these ceremonies is questionable and meaningless. Instead of practising &amp;lsquo;Shamanism&amp;rsquo;, start living minimally. Respect, and stop appropriating &amp;ndash; especially for profit &amp;ndash; from other cultures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Life is Hard by Kieran Setiya</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6139/book-review-life-is-hard-by-kieran-setiya#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/life-is-hard.jpg" height="499" alt="The cover of 'Life is Hard' has an illustration of a hummingbird and a thistle" width="312"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life is Hard: How Philosophy Can Help Us Find Our Way&lt;/strong&gt; (Hutchinson Heinemann) by Kieran Setiya&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kieran Setiya is an accomplished analytic philosopher and, increasingly, one of the finest public philosophers working today. His latest book, &lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt;, was written during the pandemic and its title certainly captures the present mood. But Setiya doesn&amp;rsquo;t just mean that life is hard now. After all, haven&amp;rsquo;t infirmity, grief and injustice always been with us, and won&amp;rsquo;t they remain so? Setiya&amp;rsquo;s focus is on the core features of life that make it seemingly inevitably hard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is a rich and rewarding read, reckoning with everything from personal failure to the meaning of life. The philosophy is fed by examples from Setiya&amp;rsquo;s life: his teenage heartbreak, the onset in his twenties of chronic and excruciating pelvic pain, his mother&amp;rsquo;s Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease, his involvement in climate activism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setiya is surely right that there are hardships that almost all lives will face, sooner or later; such is the human condition. His aim is to help us in &amp;ldquo;making the best of a bad lot&amp;rdquo;. He examines the ingredients that make life hard one by one, but what emerges is a view of life as a whole: humanistic, rooted in our social nature, and notably influenced by the novelist and philosopher Iris Murdoch. And if you have a stereotype of the philosophy professor as coldly rationalistic, then the centrality that Setiya gives to love might surprise you. &amp;ldquo;We are made for love,&amp;rdquo; he writes, &amp;ldquo;and we are lost without it.&amp;rdquo; Personally, I most often found his remarks to be moving and true. Some, perhaps, might find the book overly sentimental.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt; reveals the benefits of bringing careful analysis to the problems of life, but it also shows that this kind of philosophy calls for emotional intelligence. What it offers, ultimately, is consolation by acknowledgement. Setiya doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to magic away the problem of grief, for example, as the Stoic philosopher Epictetus did. Rather, he gives us words to understand our grief better, and so perhaps helps us live with the reality of love and loss. He supports this perspective throughout with a wonderful diversity of sources from literature, social science, psychology and history &amp;ndash; from the Bhagavad Gita to Gerrard Winstanley to Annie Ernaux.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discussion of failure is particularly illuminating. Setiya seeks to demonstrate how philosophy can liberate us, by showing that it&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to think of our lives in terms of one big narrative, at the end of which we&amp;rsquo;re either &amp;ldquo;winners&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;losers&amp;rdquo;. He also highlights the social forces that encourage us to think this way. Indeed, he shows how we must move beyond the logic of the self-help genre, by insisting on the social source of our problems and, where possible, their social remedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is why Setiya looks outward as well as inward, in part because when you look inward what you discover is how the world out there has made you. Perhaps the book&amp;rsquo;s vision is most inspiring and ambitious when he argues that the meaning of life itself is ultimately a political issue. &lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt; makes a compelling case that whether human life is meaningful depends on whether we give it meaning by collectively striving towards justice for humanity as a whole. Here, unlike in the case of our individual life stories, Setiya encourages us to think of the human story in terms of a grand narrative. He acknowledges the similarities with those great German philosophers Hegel and Marx, but unlike them he doesn&amp;rsquo;t see any historical destination as inevitable. It all depends on whether we get our act together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Is Hard&lt;/em&gt; is a weighty and satisfying book. Some people might find it a little too earnest, even with Setiya&amp;rsquo;s likeable sense of humour. The seriousness feels so mandatory that it is tempting to rebel against it. Life is hard, the title tells us, and Setiya offers no superficial escapes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How neo-Nazis are radicalising gamers</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6137/how-neo-nazis-are-radicalising-gamers#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Graphics from 'Assassin's Creed: Valhalla'" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/valhalla.jpg" height="540" alt="A graphic from Assassin's Creed: Valhalla shows a Viking-esque warrior walking through a battlefield carrying an axe" width="960"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might seem contradictory that the most hateful viewpoints are often coupled with a yearning for a return to a romantic, idyllic past. In order for any political movement to survive, its leaders have to tell stories about how they think the world should be. On the far right, it usually goes as follows: our lands were once places of unspoiled, awe-inspiring natural beauty. People lived materially tough but spiritually enriching lives, graced with pristine, entirely white, nuclear families, green spaces and physical and psychological strength. The only thing they had to do to protect their way of life was to defend themselves &amp;ndash; unfailingly, violently &amp;ndash; against outsiders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if there isn&amp;rsquo;t a period of history that backs up that narrative, you can just invent one. A prime example of this is the far right&amp;rsquo;s celebration of the Vikings &amp;ndash; inaccurately re-envisioned as a singular white race built on glory and bloodshed, with a visually striking and fearsome aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Nazi party repeatedly adopted Viking and Nordic symbols to craft a fantasy of the Aryan race; the swastika is based on an ancient, Nordic artefact. As alt-right politics rose to the surface of party politics following the election of Donald Trump to the presidency, Norse-age symbols and &amp;ldquo;alt-history&amp;rdquo; also began to reappear. A year later, at the Unite the Right Rally, organised by Richard Spencer, protestors could be seen carrying Thor&amp;rsquo;s hammer as they marched through the streets of Charlottesville &amp;ndash; an event that led to the murder of Heather Heyer, after a participant deliberately drove their car into a crowd of counter-protestors. The Viking helmets seen in the Capitol riots in 2021 were also part of the far right&amp;rsquo;s perversion of Norse folklore and paganism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around this time, extremism researchers were also becoming concerned with the gaming community, which seemed to be increasingly overrun by violent, extremist imagery and propaganda. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t incidental. When the former Trump strategist Steve Bannon took over US far-right outlet Breitbart, he used his position to encourage Gamergate: an organised, misogynistic online harassment campaign directed against feminist gamers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recent research from the Global Network of Extremism and Technology (GNET) looks at the weaponisation by the far right of two video games in particular: &lt;em&gt;Assassins Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;. Both are based on an alt-history in which gamers can play out their white supremacist fantasies. &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is rooted in Greek and Norse mythology and has been frequently criticised for graphic scenes of violence and portrayals of toxic masculinity. Artwork from &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; has also been adopted by recognised white supremacist groups and shared online. The study shows how these hyper-real, reconstructed versions of history were adopted by fascists and scattered across the digital space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even before the release of &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed [Valhalla]&lt;/em&gt;, the game&amp;rsquo;s developers knew it would be used by white supremacists. There was a tonne of pre-warning press saying that they were trying to avoid the game being manipulated by Nazis. The argument you could make, though, is that they have still created this extremely sensationalised version of Vikings which isn&amp;rsquo;t accurate,&amp;rdquo; Dr Ashton Kingdon, a teaching fellow in criminology at the University of Southampton, who authored the report, tells me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Historical fantasies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; was launched in 2020 as the 12th instalment of the Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed series. It had the biggest launch to date, selling most of its copy within its first week. It is games developer Ubisoft&amp;rsquo;s second most profitable venture, gaining over $1 billion in revenue in 2022. Santa Monica Studio&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is a franchise that was originally based on Greek mythology. However, with its 2018 series, the developers decided to incorporate Norse mythology. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to overestimate the popularity of both games. Despite &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s mixed reviews, the game built up a fan base of 20 million players in just two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story of &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; centres on Eivor, whom the player can cast as male or female, and their brother Sigurd. It&amp;rsquo;s 873 CE. The siblings&amp;rsquo; backstory is told at the start of the game, over speeding visuals of a luminous, misty forest, as they recount witnessing their parents&amp;rsquo; murder before their eyes. From there, they take to England &amp;ndash; a land already populated with Danes and Norse after years of battle. The task is to gather allies and recruit new soldiers to defend the &amp;ldquo;homeland&amp;rdquo; against England&amp;rsquo;s begrudged four kingdoms: Mercia, East Anglia, Northumbria and Wessex. Players siege castles, set thatched huts alight and generally raid and massacre their way to glory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an immersive, cinematic game, full of expansive scenes of rolling green hills in Dark Age England. You can also wander through the mountainous terrains of Vinland, an area first discovered by Leif Erikson in 1000 CE, five centuries before Columbus. It&amp;rsquo;s not all killing and pillaging, either. The game throws you into some emotionally testing scenarios. You find yourself ushered into making swift, life-ending decisions over suspected traitors, or unearthing the motivations behind a man who is haunted by the spirit of his dead wife. For some relief, you can sing songs or partake in a drinking game or two.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The attention to detail and artistry are impressive, and the romanticisation might not seem immediately harmful. But when it falls into the wrong hands, an intricate, highly realistic rendition of Viking mythology sends a worrying message. One of the main gripes for historians is the overarching use of the term &amp;ldquo;Viking&amp;rdquo; itself. The idea of the blue-eyed, blonde-haired warrior conquering Europe just isn&amp;rsquo;t true. Viking, Kingdon explains, is actually a verb, alluding to the group&amp;rsquo;s activities. The seafarers settled across the Mediterranean, Caspian, Black, Arctic and North Atlantic seas. They could be distinguishable from Celts or Saxons not because of their ethnicity, but because of their skill in sailing. It was only in the 19th century, when Europe was becoming increasingly nationalistic, that the myth that the Vikings were a superior race &amp;ndash; descended from a genetically pure bloodline &amp;ndash; began to take hold of the popular psyche.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The imaginary locations shown in &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; tap into the insidious idea of &amp;ldquo;the hyperborea.&amp;rdquo; As Abbie Richards, an extremism researcher, succinctly puts it in a video explainer: &amp;ldquo;Hyperborea was this ancient, high civilisation where the Aryan race &amp;ndash; white people &amp;ndash; lived in paradise before they were forced to mix with other races. It&amp;rsquo;s a racist fairytale used to perpetuate white supremacy and to justify racist violence. This stuff is racist and antisemitic but also coded enough that people just engage with it like it&amp;rsquo;s just a story.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The term is rooted in esoteric Nazism, what Richards describes as &amp;ldquo;white supremacy disguised as a web of metaphysical and mystical nonsense. This flavour of Nazism is obsessed with the mythical Aryan race and restoring it [even though] it was never a thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Violence and video games&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, should we worry about these games and others like them? Not necessarily, but it&amp;rsquo;s a difficult line to toe. Researchers have emphasised that it&amp;rsquo;s not about the games themselves as much as how they are used. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing that&amp;rsquo;s inherent in video games that leads people towards extremist views or actions, nor is it the case that the violence within gaming &amp;ndash; or any other medium, like horror films or music &amp;ndash; will act as a form of radicalisation. In 2020, reanalysis of often-cited 2008 research from the American Psychological Association rebuffed claims that video games lead to an increase in aggressive behaviour. On the contrary, after reviewing 28 papers, the Royal Society for Open Science proposed that video games could have a positive impact on cognition and self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moral panics surrounding video games do not help to answer the complex question of why some people commit unthinkable acts. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of pseudo-psychology that sweeps aside structural issues, like regulation in technology and mental health care. By robbing people of their agency, it fails to hold the powerful to account. The National Rifle Association regularly blames video games for mass shootings to deflect from conversations on gun control. Following the shooting in Parkland, Florida in 2018, Trump said that &amp;ldquo;we have to do something ... I&amp;rsquo;m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people&amp;rsquo;s thoughts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would it be possible for an ordinary person without any particularly strong political leanings to spend hours playing &lt;em&gt;Assassins Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and emerge as a neo-Nazi? Kingdon doesn&amp;rsquo;t think so. &amp;ldquo;No, I think it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous to blame the games themselves for radicalisation. Video games themselves don&amp;rsquo;t create terrorists because the narratives in these games are not extreme. It&amp;rsquo;s more about the way they&amp;rsquo;ve been manipulated and weaponised as propaganda,&amp;rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Meme wars&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To really understand radicalisation in technology, we need to understand online subcultures and communities. Gaming has historically been seen as a space for men; games are marketed towards men, and have a history of casual misogyny. Female gamers, journalists and developers are often seen as intruders in this space and are targeted accordingly. At the start of Gamergate in 2014, feminists in gaming seeking better representation in storylines and the industry itself faced an onslaught of online abuse and threats. It is now widely acknowledged that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just organic. White supremacist groups used Gamergate as a political recruiting tool. Steve Bannon described how he was able to identify gamers as &amp;ldquo;These guys, these rootless white males [who] had monster power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As alt-right figures used Gamergate to drum up support for Trump in online, misogynistic spaces, the neo-pagan, hypermasculine figures in alternative history video games have captured the same fan base. While there are plenty of women playing video games they are often still seen as unserious consumers of more violent games marketed to men. In 2022, the Bryter annual gamers study found that an increasing number of women were playing video games, but that 72 per cent of them had experienced some form of harassment, with 36 per cent of them experiencing it regularly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might seem impossible to understand why anyone in society today would be drawn to the same Aryan race myths deployed in propaganda nearly a century ago. But many right-wing groups are adept at understanding and manipulating the language and imagery that young people, or at least some young people, can relate to. &amp;ldquo;The alt right knows that it won&amp;rsquo;t ever be able to get power in the ballot box. The only way they can attempt to gain influence is by shifting things culturally. They use images and symbols not just in games, but in meme culture too,&amp;rdquo; says Kingdon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In her book &lt;em&gt;Meme Wars: The Untold Story of the Online Battles&lt;/em&gt;, Joan Donovan describes how the right were able to capture audiences by offering simple, emotive images and slogans designed to be repeated and reshared across the internet: &amp;ldquo;Meme wars are culture wars, accelerated and intensified because of the infrastructure and incentives of the internet, which trades outrage and extremity as currency, rewards speed and scale, and flattens the experience of the world into a never-ending scroll of images and words, a morass capable of swallowing patience, kindness and understanding.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, too, went through what researchers would describe as a form of memification. By taking screenshots and images from games like these and reposting them online as memes, extremists are able to instruct recruits on how they should be consumed and interpreted. GNET&amp;rsquo;s research points out that in 2018, an Italian far-right activist, Luca Triani, carried out a drive-by shooting in Marceta, where he injured five men and one woman of African origin. Triani was draped in an Italian flag and shouting &amp;ldquo;Viva l&amp;rsquo;Italia.&amp;rdquo; The shooting is thought to have acted as a motivation for the Christchurch attacks in 2019. Triani may have been acting alone, but he was not a &amp;ldquo;lone wolf&amp;rdquo;. The attack came a month before Italy&amp;rsquo;s general election, with parties of almost all political stripes blaming immigrants for frictions in society and a weakened economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His actions also had repercussions in a section of the gaming community, where he became a symbol around which the far right could rally. On Gab, a tech platform popular with social media users on the far right, a widely circulated meme shows Triani portrayed as the leading character in &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, known as Kratos. It was first posted shortly after the attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Not Viking enough'&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s only a small number of people operating in gaming that are locked into these highly distorted views of society. But when these views do appear, they are as deliberately grotesque as possible. A cursory look on Reddit, which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend for anyone&amp;rsquo;s sanity, reveals users complaining that &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s developers Ubisoft have caved in to external pressure and become &amp;ldquo;too woke&amp;rdquo;. The most pressing concern on the thread is that there is no opportunity to rape anyone in the game, which didn&amp;rsquo;t make it &amp;ldquo;Viking&amp;rdquo; enough &amp;ndash; a complaint that&amp;rsquo;s been repeated on several forums. (It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that no popular video game, including &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, offers this function.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to police some of the behaviour in online gaming communities as so much of it is steeped in irony and humour. There&amp;rsquo;s no way of being able to tell if someone sharing a meme or even stating something vulgar or offensive is planning a terrorist act, or even if they believe in what they&amp;rsquo;re saying in any sense. Sometimes, a meme with deeply hidden connotations with the far right has been repeated so many times that it is stripped of its meaning and appears as a simple joke. Even the most advanced of analysts are usually unable to pinpoint someone&amp;rsquo;s motivations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean nothing can be done. TikTok banned the term &amp;ldquo;hyperborea&amp;rdquo; from its search function after fake videos claiming to show forgotten, hidden snow civilisations received millions of views. That won&amp;rsquo;t stop TikTok users who are so inclined to find alternative ways of posting esoteric Nazi content through using similar hashtags, but it at least shows that those holding the reins in big tech are aware of these far-right dog whistles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been attempts within the gaming community to tackle toxic attitudes through broader representation in storylines. &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, for example, includes a female protagonist, while &lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnar&amp;ouml;k&lt;/em&gt;, launched in 2021, has also included Black, female characters. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell, however, how cynical these inclusions may turn out to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While developers may protest that no one can know how any fictional work will be used and adapted, this can also be argued as a reason to be more cautious. The GNET research showed that the developers of &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; were aware that the games risked indulging the far right. And yet they still gave their players storylines that recycled dangerous prejudices. Meanwhile, Ubisoft made over $2 billion in revenue in 2022 alone. In an increasingly right-wing political landscape, games developers and technology companies making extortionate profits can afford to tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here for access to the full magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="St Lawrence's church in Castle Rising, Norfolk. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/rodell1.jpg" height="913" alt="St Lawrence's church in Castle Rising, Norfolk" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By all accounts, Philip North is a very nice man. In fact, the Church of England, which appointed him as Bishop of Blackburn in January 2022, contains a lot of decent, well-meaning people. Unfortunately many of them are rather upset, because Philip North is opposed to the ordination of women priests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apparently he does not object to women having authority over men, and has no problem working with women priests. But he does not think the Church of England should unilaterally take decisions which should be made together with the Roman Catholic, Orthodox and other Anglican churches. This is 30 years after the Church first accepted women priests, and seven years after it appointed its first female bishop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just after North&amp;rsquo;s appointment came the recommendations from a five-year study by Church of England bishops, supported by its General Synod after an emotional debate, that the Church should continue to deny church marriages to same-sex couples, but instead &amp;ldquo;lament and repent of the failure&amp;hellip; to be welcoming to LGBTQI+ people&amp;rdquo; and provide &amp;ldquo;prayers of thanksgiving, dedication and for God&amp;rsquo;s blessing&amp;rdquo; for same-sex couples married in civil ceremonies. At the same time, they voted to reaffirm the doctrine that marriage is only between a man and a woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also leads the global Anglican Communion, where &amp;ldquo;The average Anglican is a woman in sub-Saharan Africa in her thirties&amp;rdquo;. Anglican churches in the global south are vehemently opposed to same-sex marriage. He avoided a schism at the Communion&amp;rsquo;s 2022 Lambeth Conference by persuading delegates to agree to disagree, while reaffirming a 1998 statement &amp;ldquo;rejecting homosexual practice as incompatible with Scripture&amp;rdquo;. After the Synod&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;blessings&amp;rdquo; decision, he said he would not be giving any personally, and made emollient remarks to African bishops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was not enough. The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches, which represents 10 of the 42 provinces in the Anglican Communion, responded by withdrawing its recognition of Justin Welby as the Communion&amp;rsquo;s leader, stating that the Church of England was &amp;ldquo;disqualified&amp;rdquo; as their historic &amp;ldquo;Mother Church&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the problem will not go away within the Church of England itself. &amp;ldquo;We love and bless you, but your relationships are second class&amp;rdquo; is not a sustainable message.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are not the only ethical challenges facing the Church. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse reported in 2020 that it had failed to protect children. More abuse revelations surfaced in 2022. It also has an ethnic issue. According to Mike Royal, the Pentecostal head of Churches Together in England: &amp;ldquo;Urban Anglican Churches depend on black membership for their backbone.&amp;rdquo; Yet a report on the General Synod early in 2022 was headed: &amp;ldquo;Lord Boateng holds Synod&amp;rsquo;s feet to the fire over Church&amp;rsquo;s racism record.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A cliff edge&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may think, &amp;ldquo;So what if the Church ties itself in knots?&amp;rdquo; But these are symptoms of a bigger underlying issue which affects us all. To understand it, we need to look behind the &amp;ldquo;Less than half of England and Wales population identifies as Christian&amp;rdquo; headlines which accompanied the 2021 Census results. The Census is unrivalled when it comes to local detail, but provides no analysis of &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo;. Fortunately we have the British Social Attitudes Survey (BSAS), which asks a more refined question about religious belonging, and provides a denominational breakdown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What it tells us is that Anglican identity is falling off a cliff. In the mid-1980s, around two in five British adults considered themselves Anglican. Now, half of British adults have no religious identity. Of the 40 per cent identifying as Christian, only a third are Anglicans. Around a fifth are Catholics, with the rest a mix of declining Nonconformist churches, and growing Orthodox, Pentecostal and smaller denominations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the face of it, the Church has massive potential influence over the country&amp;rsquo;s young people. It controls a quarter of England&amp;rsquo;s state-funded primary schools, and some secondaries. Often they have faith-based admission criteria, and in many places the Church primary school is the only practical option for parents. A few years ago, the then chair of the Church&amp;rsquo;s board of education, John Pritchard, called for clergy to be trained to use its schools to extend the Church&amp;rsquo;s mission: &amp;ldquo;The clergy ought to have a camp bed in there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it is not working. The main driver of decline is not Anglicans leaving, but children of Anglicans not carrying on with the faith. While a third of people aged 75 and over identify with the Church, only one in a hundred under-25s do. One per cent. English Anglicanism is literally dying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at practice rather than identity, the mathematician John Hayward applied the &amp;ldquo;R number&amp;rdquo; methodology familiar from Covid-19 to church attendance data, and concluded that the Church of England would become extinct around 2060. The response from Stephen Cottrell, the Archbishop of York, was that &amp;ldquo;the church of Jesus Christ is not an organisation that lives or dies by graphs going up and down&amp;rdquo;. This is the man who, in 2021, proposed a new growth strategy involving the establishment of 10,000 new lay-led churches over 10 years &amp;ndash; around three a day &amp;ndash; a plan which led Canon Angela Tilby to wonder whether &amp;ldquo;in a desperate attempt to avoid facing&amp;hellip; reality, we have entered a state of corporate psychosis: a leap into false consciousness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Speaking in tongues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As well as shrinking, the Church is changing. For some time, it has been moving in an evangelical, and especially &amp;ldquo;charismatic&amp;rdquo; direction: the form of Christianity featuring personal experiences of the Holy Spirt, healing miracles, and speaking in tongues, a practice which Justin Welby says he began aged 19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A key vehicle has been the Alpha Course, which began at the &amp;ndash; very posh &amp;ndash; Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) Anglican Church in Kensington. It spread rapidly in the 1990s across the Church of England, and to other denominations and other countries, promising &amp;ldquo;an opportunity to explore the meaning of life&amp;rdquo;. HTB is now a major force in the Church, with nearly 100 churches in its network. But it has not stemmed the Church&amp;rsquo;s overall decline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand this decline, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to make a distinction between &amp;ldquo;societal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;congregational&amp;rdquo; religion. In the past, the Church of England was &amp;ldquo;societal&amp;rdquo;: some people went to services, others just on special occasions. But most people felt they somehow belonged. That no longer applies. Evangelical Anglicanism is &amp;ldquo;congregational&amp;rdquo;. Its members are aware that many others think some of their practices bizarre, or their views strange. But they&amp;rsquo;ve come to Jesus, and face a sinful world together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet, as we shall see, there are reasons why this smaller, increasingly evangelical, less &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; and more female entity will not simply take its place among others as it sinks into our diverse religion and belief landscape. The Church&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;established&amp;rdquo; status is under increasing pressure, both because of its decline and because of its position on same-sex marriage. Yet Justin Welby still wants to keep the privileges that establishment brings, including 26 bishops in the House of Lords.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is not alone in wanting the Church to remain a part of the state. According to Bristol University&amp;rsquo;s Tariq Modood, minority faiths also like this arrangement, in the belief that it provides a &amp;ldquo;canopy&amp;rdquo; of respect for all people of religious faith. It may go further than respect. There was some discussion, after Queen Elizabeth II&amp;rsquo;s death, as to whether our new monarch should retain the role of Supreme Governor of the Church of England (see Andrew Copson in the Winter 2022 issue of New Humanist). Among the minority voices who spoke in favour of King Charles III&amp;rsquo;s taking on the &amp;ldquo;Defender of the Faith&amp;rdquo; title was (Lord) Daniel Finkelstein, who expressed his belief that the role did more than protect the Anglican community. &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;as a Jew I feel I cannot be fully secure in respect for my own religion unless assurance is given by someone secure in what they themselves believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a recent survey for the think-tank Theos, a third of all non-religious people in the UK agreed that &amp;ldquo;Religion is comparable to the smallpox virus, but harder to eradicate&amp;rdquo; (it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t account for a third of all humanists.) That sounds like &amp;ldquo;contempt for all religion&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; although, importantly, it does not mean &amp;ldquo;contempt for all religious people&amp;rdquo;. Meanwhile, there is no evidence that the established Church does anything to protect against antisemitism, or anti-Muslim prejudice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clearly we must be careful not to allow an uncomprehending religious/non-religious divide to damage the country. The end of establishment for the Church of England, when it comes, might usefully be accompanied by a reassurance that human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, remain protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Financial atonement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also the finances to consider. We still have 16,000 Anglican church buildings, nearly 80 per cent of them &amp;ldquo;listed&amp;rdquo; by Historic England, many with small congregations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Operating and maintaining old buildings takes a lot of money. Fortunately, the Church has plenty of it. Unlike a company, with a Chief Executive and an annual report, the Church&amp;rsquo;s finances are complex. In 2016, Ed Moore, then Treasurer of the National Secular Society, attempted to estimate its total wealth. He came up with over &amp;pound;22 billion. Today, Church Commissioners manage &amp;pound;10 billion in assets, in addition to the &amp;pound;5 billion or so held by the 42 dioceses. Over the past 30 years, the Commissioners claim their average return has been an impressive 10 per cent. All of this is tax free (see Emma Park on page 42).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a purely financial viewpoint, then, the Church Commissioners could carry on indefinitely. Meanwhile, its diminishing band of parishioners manage to raise &amp;pound;1 billion each year, but say they are desperately starved of funds. Although the Commissioners have recently increased their funding for the Church&amp;rsquo;s operations, Justin Welby says the purpose is to provide &amp;ldquo;support for mission so every person might hear the Good News of Jesus Christ&amp;hellip; [and] support our aims to double the number of children and young disciples by 2030&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reaction from parish level was therefore predictable when the Church announced it would spend &amp;pound;100 million to atone for the fact that some of its wealth &amp;ndash; equivalent to &amp;pound;1.4 billion in today&amp;rsquo;s money according to one calculation &amp;ndash; can be traced back to investments in slavery in the 18th century. The money would go on a &amp;ldquo;programme of investment, research and engagement&amp;rdquo; including funding to support &amp;ldquo;communities affected by historic slavery&amp;rdquo;. Nothing wrong with that, of course. But Rev Marcus Walker, chairman of Save The Parish, was understandably upset: &amp;ldquo;After decades of telling us that there is no money to fund the churches and priests who keep the church alive on the front line, suddenly they&amp;rsquo;ve found &amp;pound;100 million behind the back of the sofa.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no easy solutions to the problem of large numbers of listed buildings little used for their original purpose as places of worship. But a diminished Church cannot expect to protect a legacy of enormous wealth and tax-exempt investments, while at the same time starving its parishes and relying on charities, with a bit of government support, to conserve its estate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One beneficial use is as a base for local social action, of which the Church is rightly proud. Yes, plenty of non-religious people make important contributions here, as do non-Christian faith groups. But the Church has a physical presence in a lot more places, providing the infrastructure for foodbanks, playgroups and places to go in emergencies. As the traditional model of churches and vicars becomes increasingly unsustainable, new solutions will be needed to keep the social action baby while the Anglican bathwater flows away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hollowed out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the time being at least, the Church retains a carapace of a great national institution: massive wealth; still-significant power; a substantial bureaucracy, both centrally and duplicated across 42 dioceses (with more senior clergy now than 20 years ago); buildings in virtually every city, town and village, many of cultural importance; the Head of State as its Supreme Governor, reflecting its established status; and control over a quarter of the country&amp;rsquo;s state-funded primary schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But inside the carapace, it is hollowed out. While many appreciate its social work, musical tradition, buildings and people, a rapidly diminishing number identify with it, share its metaphysical beliefs, subscribe to its positions on LGBTQI+ equality &amp;ndash; and still, in some places, gender equality &amp;ndash; or attend its services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You would not know that by reading its strategy. Its vision is still to be &amp;ldquo;A Church for the whole nation which is Jesus Christ centred, and shaped by, the five marks of mission&amp;rdquo;, the first two of which are all about evangelism and proselytisation. As well as becoming &amp;ldquo;younger and more diverse&amp;rdquo;, its strategic priorities are to become a church of &amp;ldquo;missionary disciples&amp;rdquo;, where &amp;ldquo;every person in England has access to an enriching and compelling community of faith by adding new churches and new forms of Church.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;corporate psychosis&amp;rdquo; speaking. Sooner or later, reality must strike, and the carapace adapt to its contents. The question is how this major transition will take place, over what period, and what sort of creature will emerge at the end. We all have an interest in the answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, there is no case for a diminished Church to have a privileged status in the constitution of a plural, and increasingly non-&lt;br&gt;religious, country. Establishment, and with it bishops in the House of Lords, needs to go. And an institution with an evangelical agenda overtly targeting young people should not be in control of state-funded schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from that, maybe a values-based approach offers a way forward. Many people would agree with the other &amp;ldquo;Marks of Mission&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, which are about social justice, violence reduction, peace and reconciliation, and the environment. Instead of faith-based structures accommodating people with a range of values, could there be values-based structures accommodating people with a range of beliefs?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe a new values-based body, or local community trusts, should take ownership of many of the buildings, and most of the wealth, with the Church becoming one of many users of its spaces. Perhaps such a body could find a way, without erasing the history, to provide a community focus without the religious baggage, where everyone locally could feel at home, irrespective of their beliefs, ethnicity, education or income &amp;ndash; an increasingly important need in a fractured society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But conversations about a realistic future are hard to envisage while Church leaders continue in their &amp;ldquo;state of false consciousness&amp;rdquo;. Accepting and managing decline is hard, especially when you think your mission is God-given. But at some stage, something has to give.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A history of women's desire</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6135/a-history-of-womens-desire#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'The Circle of Love' (1917) by Gerda Wegener. Credit: Bridgeman Images" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bal_79151.jpg" height="782" alt="'The Circle of Love' by Gerda Wegener is a painting from 1917 depicting an erotic relationship between two women" width="800"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent YouGov poll asked Britons about their &amp;ldquo;love language&amp;rdquo;. The survey referred to US author Gary Chapman&amp;rsquo;s concept of the &amp;ldquo;five love languages,&amp;rdquo; which are summarised as quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service and touch. To most British men and women, praise and time together were the preferred ways to feel loved by their partners. But some of the results were strikingly gendered. Over 20 per cent of men placed utmost importance on physical touch, while only 7 per cent of women cared about it. The figures were practically flipped when it came to acts of service, considered to be &amp;ldquo;helping&amp;rdquo; or doing those little things that make someone&amp;rsquo;s life easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poll, while not straightforwardly pernicious, is nonetheless problematic. The idea of &amp;ldquo;love languages&amp;rdquo; is a piece of pop psychology, rather than a scientific phenomenon. The results reinforce the idea that, when it comes to love, men value sex, while women value atonement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Historian Eleanor Janega is concerned about the way concepts such as &amp;ldquo;love languages&amp;rdquo; are being co-opted. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re seeing a lot of reactionary ideas come to the forefront and a real pushing of the idea that women are first and foremost baby machines, and that we exist in this biological capacity where we are always and for ever at a kind of disadvantage to men,&amp;rdquo; Janega said at the 2 March launch of her latest book, &lt;em&gt;The Once and Future Sex&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Misogynist propagandists like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate often push this notion that women are naturally nurturing and subdued beings, corrupted by feminist ideology. Men, in turn, are instinctive, corporeal creatures. In response, Janega decided to do a &amp;ldquo;real deep-dive, historical look at gender&amp;rdquo;, reminding us all that its perceived natures and assigned duties are blatantly socially constructed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this, she turned to a historic period that is relatively unexamined when it comes to the female perspective, let alone when related to sex and desire. &lt;em&gt;The Once and Future Sex&lt;/em&gt; explores the ways in which women were seen in the course of the roughly 1,000 years we call the Middle Ages. Between the fifth and 15th century, the book shows, women weren&amp;rsquo;t seen as inherently frigid homebodies or delusional romantics. As Janega puts it, &amp;ldquo;the majority of recorded European history thinks that women are innately sex-crazed.&amp;rdquo; Similarly, her research shows how the great majority of women in the Middle Ages worked outside the home, in the fields, as shop- or innkeepers, as midwives or maids, or in the many industries and crafts of the period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women were also not seen as exceptional when holding jobs, even when married with children. In fact, those who could proficiently run household or business accounts and manage staff were understood as assets and better wives. The &lt;em&gt;Once and Future Sex&lt;/em&gt; is peppered with such examples and anecdotes, helping us not only humanise our foremothers, but also remember how profoundly historically contextual our ideas of women are. With stories like that of the 15th-century London wool merchant Rose of Burford, who upon her husband&amp;rsquo;s death continued running the business and even settled fiscal arrangements with the crown, or of her French contemporary Christine de Pizan, the court author who wrote the &amp;ldquo;equivalent of a medieval best seller&amp;rdquo;, &lt;em&gt;The Book of the City of Ladies&lt;/em&gt;, Janega spurs you on until the final page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her conclusion is that, while those 1,000 years are indeed the pillars upon which western societies are built, medieval people and their thoughts are not transposable to our times, nor can they possibly serve as illustration to contemporary sexist tropes. On the contrary, as Janega writes, &amp;ldquo;seeing the past and rejecting it allows us to imagine new futures and make the changes that are necessary to create a more equitable world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is in the spirit of creating a more equitable world that journalist Sophie K. Rosa&amp;rsquo;s debut book &lt;em&gt;Radical Intimacy&lt;/em&gt; is written. With great diligence, Rosa goes about exploring the ways in which our socioeconomic system robs us of authentic and liberatory intimacy. The book explores alternative narratives for love and intimacy, reporting on the communities who have over the last century proven that there is life beyond the mainstream norms &amp;ndash; not only when it comes to romance and family, but also wider issues like death and home ownership, friendship, care and solidarity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an ambitious book by a great reporter, and the research is exhaustive: from the Gay Liberation Front London communes of the 1970s to today&amp;rsquo;s Campaign for Psych Abolition, fighting against the incarcerating and often punitive nature of psychiatric care. But one keeps wanting to hear Rosa&amp;rsquo;s voice through the beautifully woven stats and quotes. While the introduction feels like a rousing call to arms, the rest of the book reads like a collection of journalistic pieces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite their very different topics, Janega and Rosa&amp;rsquo;s books work well in tandem. Where one confronts misinformed tropes with the real lives of women living 500 years ago, the other shows us that there is nothing inevitable about patriarchal or heteronormative relations: we are living side by side with the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both prove vital reading in a world struggling for palliative answers and often resorting to regressive ideologies. Both provide hope. And both prove how women do not uniformly fit into the boxes provided by pseudo-scientific theories like the five love languages. Women have been sex workers, sole landowners, squatters, carers, artists, asexual, bisexual, queer or not identifying as women at all. And all these people, past and present, have experienced moments of authenticity and moments of intimacy &amp;ndash; not just in spite of, but often because of, their idiosyncrasies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eleanor Janega's "The Once and Future Sex" is published by W. W. Norton &amp;amp; Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sophie K. Rosa's "Radical Intimacy" is published by Pluto Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here for access to the full magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>I am delighted to say that the second series of our On Your Mind podcast has launched today!!</p>



<p>Each week, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will explore aspects of the human psyche, including astrology, how the clothes we wear influence our thoughts, attraction, friendship, dreaming, mind control and much much more.  We will also be joined by some special guests as we attempt to answer all of your questions about psychology. The first series reached No.1 in Apple Podcast’s Science charts, and so we hope that you can join us. </p>



<p>Our first episode looks at creativity and explores how to have good ideas and whether children are more creative than adults. You can listen <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2txmeCf9U2rj4aAdMLoczK">here</a>.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
