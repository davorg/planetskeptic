    <title>The argument from “my piece of wood hasn’t evolved eyeballs”</title>

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;This one wins a prize for the dumbest creationist argument of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcript down below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-69913"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, friends &amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered a very silly argument on YouTube, and I thought I&amp;#8217;d share it, and then talk a bit about how I might address it, absurd as it is. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I&amp;#8217;m not going to transcribe it for you. In summary, creationist set aside a bit of lumber a year and a half ago, explains that it hasn&amp;#8217;t turned into a butterfly or grown eyeballs.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument that evolution is wrong because my scrap of wood hasn&amp;#8217;t grown eyeballs is one of the worst I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen. Evolutionary biology makes no claim, no prediction that a dead piece of wood will evolve, and it&amp;#8217;s not even a reasonable inference from the theory. Let&amp;#8217;s dismiss it out of hand. You&amp;#8217;re all smart enough to see the bad reasoning there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take another approach, if he has a block of wood, I have a small piece of rock. No, I&amp;#8217;m not going to compound the fallacies by saying that Christianity makes failed claims about it, because we all recognize that religion doesn&amp;#8217;t make extravagant claims about this rock &amp;#8212; we don&amp;#8217;t expect it to sprout eyes if we pray over it, neither an atheist like me nor a fervent believer like the guy in that video believes that. Instead, I&amp;#8217;ll just talk about this rock as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a nice little rock. I use it as a worry stone, you know, a rock of a convenient size that you can rub it between thumb and forefinger. Usually, those are smooth and shiny and pretty, but as you can tell, that&amp;#8217;s not the case here. My rock is rough and angular and black. What&amp;#8217;s special about it is that I know its provenance, and I&amp;#8217;ve kept it in my coat pocket for about 35 years. I&amp;#8217;ve held this when I learned that my father had died, when my sister died, when my grandparents died, when my brother died. I find it reassuring because…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stone endures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s what I need to consider in those moments of loss. But there are also happy moments. For instance, I know exactly when and where I got this chip of rock. My oldest son and I were fossil collecting in Western Utah back in the late 80s. If you want to see a happy 8 year old, give him some eye protection and a hammer and tell him to smash open rocks, and that&amp;#8217;s what we did together. I picked up this little fragment and dropped it into my pocket, where it has remained for a few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was near Delta, Utah, where we had permission to collect from the scrap pile of a commercial excavation. This rock was from the Wheeler Shale, a Cambrian deposit which is about 505 million years old. We were looking for trilobites. They were all over the place &amp;#8212; split open a piece of shale, and what you found was a slab of ancient sea bed, and there were trilobites and trilobite fragments and discarded trilobite exoskeletons everywhere. I still have several such slabs I&amp;#8217;ve kept, that I use as paperweights and inspirations for contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trilobites are awesome. They flourished from the Cambrian until the Great Dying at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago. It ought to be humbling to consider this great diverse clade that had a thriving empire for 270 million years until they too went extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piece I keep in my pocket has no trilobites in it, but it is of a convenient size and comes from rocks that did. I just love having a memento of half a billion years within easy reach, that I can touch whenever I want to be reminded of my place in the universe. It helps keep my perspective appropriately balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of the Preacher in Ecclesiastes,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;One generation passes away, and another generation comes;&lt;br /&gt;
But the earth abides forever.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what troubles me about Christian apologists like the fellow in that video. They are happy to abuse science to make false claims, that they think rebut a naturalistic view of the universe. They will point to trees and mountains and declare that they had to be created by a god, and god is good, but they know nothing about the deep rich history of trees and mountains. You would think that a Christian would naturally embrace science &amp;#8212; and historically, they have &amp;#8212; and strive to have a greater knowledge of what they consider God&amp;#8217;s creation. But no! Especially among the most fervent evangelical Christians, they consider their ideology and dogma far more precious than understanding the reality of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I try to put myself in their shoes, it seems tragic. How can they hope to humble themselves before their Lord if they are incapable of humbling themselves before the awesome majesty of the world they believe their god created? They can&amp;#8217;t. Humility is not the desired goal. They prefer to wallow in their arrogance and their false confidence that they know it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little we can do to help people so deeply mired in ignorance. All I can suggest is that they, and the rest of us, too, reach out and touch reality. Pick up a stone, look at a star, wade in a stream, and try to understand it as well as we can, setting aside the unwarranted nonsense of ancient dogma. Get educated. It&amp;#8217;ll open your mind and make you a better person.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">For one thing, we have to deal with the rise of <a href="https://www.ozarksfirst.com/crime/springfield-man-charged-with-demanding-meat-at-gunpoint/">Missouri Man</a>, rival to the ubiquitous Florida Man.</p>
<blockquote><p>On April 18, Republic Police Department officers were called to a Price Cutter to respond to a call about a robbery in which a man held an employee at gunpoint so that he would be served meat.</p>
<p>Larry Gene Gay, 70, of Springfield, is charged with one felony count of unlawful use of a weapon and a felony count of armed criminal action.</p>
<p>Court documents show that officers responded to the scene and ordered Gay to get out of his truck so they could arrest him. After he was taken into custody, an officer removed a loaded semi-automatic pistol with a bullet in the chamber from Gay’s hip holster.</p>
<p>In an interview, Gay said he went to Price Cutter to buy steaks. He told the “good man” who was helping him that they needed to weigh the steaks. However, the meat department was closed. Gay said at that point, he showed his gun “Just to say I’m not stealing. I need you here to help me to get a couple of these steaks. I’m not going to hurt you.”</p>
<p>The officer asked Gay why he thought the people in the store called police and told them he was threatening them with his gun.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Gay said in the interview. “I have no idea.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Hand stupid people a gun, and at some point they’re going to use it to deal with some minor inconvenience. Missouri has a lot of guns, and a lot of stupid people, it’s an inevitable problem. But we could wave that away, it’s a problem with a few individuals, I’ve met a lot of good people in Missouri, and we can’t blame the whole state.</p>
<p>Here’s wider problem, though. Missouri is run by a gang of regressive Republicans who have been passing all kinds of ugly laws. They hate transgender kids, you know, and want to deny them good healthcare. The state Attorney General, Andrew Bailey, set up a ‘snitch line’ where random concerned citizens could submit their complaints about those danged transes and their wicked doctors who poison them all with estrogen and testosterone. It’s not clear what Bailey was going to do with those complaints…arrest everyone who was androgynous? Send out genital inspectors to check the accused? It was the usual preliminaries, I suspect, where the fascist builds a list in anticipation of the day he can send out the brownshirts.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/04/trans-flag-dc.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/04/trans-flag-dc-150x100.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="100" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-69911" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/04/trans-flag-dc-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/04/trans-flag-dc-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/04/trans-flag-dc-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/04/trans-flag-dc-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/04/trans-flag-dc.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"/></a></p>
<p>It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/21/missouri-trans-snitch-form-down-after-people-spammed-it-with-the-bee-movie-script/">didn’t go as well as he’d hoped</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bailey said his office set up the tip line for parents to submit concerns about the gender-affirming care their children received from transgender youth centers. He also issued an emergency rule severely restricting access to gender-affirming care.  </p>
<p>PROMO, a Missouri LGBTQ advocacy organization, said Bailey “fanned the flames of hate” in issuing the emergency rule. </p>
<p>“The Attorney General’s claims are maliciously cherry-picked and come from unverified sources that allow him to promulgate disgusting, obstructive, and misleading information into an emergency rule,” PROMO said in a statement. “It should be clear to anyone paying attention that the real threat to Missourians is the attorney general himself.”</p>
<p>Social media users on TikTok, Twitter and Tumblr ensured that Bailey’s office would have plenty of evidence to sift through for the investigation, flooding the site with fake complaints and other ephemera.</p>
<p>When the online form first launched, it lacked a CAPTCHA, which savvy Twitter users quickly used to their advantage by using bots to spam the site. Users also employed a generator to churn out fake names and fake Missouri addresses. Others just dumped text into the complaint form, ranging from the entire script of the “Bee Movie,” to Billy May’s OxiClean sales pitch, to Walter White’s introductory monologue in “Breaking Bad.” TikTok users said they submitted the “most raunchiest fanfic from AO3” and “a saucy love story of Mario and Luigi.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Love wins in the end, right?</p>
<p>But here’s my dilemma. I’m a regular tourist visiting Missouri — I go for <a href="https://skepticon.org/">Skepticon</a> every summer. The question I wrestle with is…should I refuse to go again, and not contribute my travel dollars to a fascist, theocratic state? Or should I go, and contribute my travel dollars to the good kinds of Missourians who support a liberal skeptical conference? I’ve got time to resolve this internal debate since the organizers haven’t even announced a date for the event.</p>
<p>They could fix my problem for me by moving the whole Skepticon show north, to a progressive state (not Iowa), but that leaves the good Missourians in the lurch. I dislike these kinds of decisions. My problem would go away if Missouri would just throw the rascals out, but that isn’t going to happen this year, or maybe even in years to come.</p>

<p class="lead">Every time they try to hide an ugly fact of history, they look worse — they’re just compounding the problem. We’re seeing this mistake in Florida and Texas and Tennessee, where Republican legislatures cobble up laws to silence teachers and prevent them from mentioning the ghastly evils that previous legislatures have executed. It’s not going to work. It just means that the next generation is going to be confronted with the fact of American slavery, for example, <em>and</em> the fact that <a href="https://www.wonkette.com/tennessee-lege-passes-fink-on-your-professor-bill-to-help-stomp-out-divisive-ideas">America tried to hush it up in the 2020s</a>. Tennessee has been eager to join in the shameful displays of cowardice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, Tennessee passed one of those cookie-cutter rightwing bills banning the teaching of “divisive concepts” in higher education — the very same sort of hogwash that’s currently under a court injunction in Florida. The law, SB 623 prohibited teaching a whole bunch of very bad ideas, like the concept that “One race or sex is inherently superior or inferior to another race or sex” or the always fun “An individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or another form of psychological distress solely because of the individual’s race or sex” — so you <a href="https://www.wonkette.com/sixty-three-years-later-white-mom-finally-gets-ruby-bridges-banned-from-elementary-school">can’t read about Ruby Bridges</a>, <em>you</em>. The bill also prohibited “penalizing” students for not endorsing the concepts, because we all know how professors like to demand that students recite from the Maoist catechism.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Do follow that link to the Ruby Bridges story. There is a woman in Florida named Emily Conklin who is going to be on the poster about the wicked perpetrators of bigotry, her picture right next to the Ku Klux Klan, the Southern Democrats of the 1960s, and Steve King of Iowa.)</p>
<p>You can tell these congressvermin know nothing about how education works — they’re of the <i>God’s Not Dead</i> school of projection, where they think <em>their</em> authoritarian vision of how to teach by law enforcement is the way we must work. For example, my genetics students have been given a bunch of papers on racist and sexist misconceptions in genetics that they’ll be summarizing in class this week…and I’ve explicitly told them that they can disagree with the papers without penalty. I can’t imagine standing up in a class and dictating how they must interpret the science. That’s not how any of this works, this is an exercise in learning how to think for themselves about the evidence.</p>
<p>Does that make me one of those red professors? There’s no way you can compel me to wear a bowtie.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Last month, I thought I’d found a color morph in S. triangulosa: some recently caught wild spiders from Wisconsin that were almost solid black, with just a hint of the standard pattern.

<p>Now I don’t need to! Look at the difference a month in the lab environment makes.</p>
<p>[I try not to splash spiders in your face here. You’ll have to look it up on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CrT9ABxvKvu/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/81858529?pr=true">Patreon</a>.]</p>
<p>That’s the same spider, almost a month apart. Now it looks all the other spiders I’ve got. I suspect it’s got to be something about the change in diet, from whatever they were finding in a garage to a steady diet of fruit flies and mealworms. </p>
<p>They were caught in Wisconsin, where they’d been living on cheese curds, brats, and La Croix, probably. </p>
<p>Also note that this spider has made a couple of egg sacs. The one in the top right is a half-assed mess, only a few eggs only partially wrapped in a thin skein of silk.</p>

<p class="lead">We’re currently isolating all freshly laid egg sacs and tagging them with the date so that we know exactly how old the embryos are. This week I started scanning all the adult containers and setting aside those who had produced an egg sac.</p>
<p>It started out well: one on Sunday, one on Tuesday, one on Thursday, and I’m thinking this is perfect — a fresh batch of 30+ embryos every other day is what we can handle easily. Then then this morning, Friday, I come in and…5 new egg sacs for 21 April.</p>
<p>Then I realize…Thursday is quarter taps night at the Met Lounge downtown. Have they been sneaking out for a wild party night, and then coming back to the lab all primed for reproduction? That’s the only rational explanation.</p>
<p>I could be concerned that I’m going to be in another situation where the lab is drowning in more spiders than we know what to do with, but we’re about to switch paradigms a little bit. Next week we start plunking lots of embryos into fixative, then the week after we start doing embryo dissections and staining with propidium iodide. None of these spiders are going to live to adulthood. Sorry.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Hilary Lawson is a philosopher and founder of the Institute of Art and Ideas" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/hilary-lawsonsquare02.jpg" height="571" alt="Hilary Lawson" width="700"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is 1882, 140 years ago. Bismarck is chancellor in Germany, Gladstone is Prime Minister in Britain, and memories of the Civil War are still fresh in the United States. A relatively unknown academic, Frederick Nietzsche, publishes what is now known as &lt;em&gt;The Gay Science&lt;/em&gt;, originally translated as &amp;ldquo;The Joyful Wisdom&amp;rdquo;. His academic career has foundered. He has given up his academic post, and almost no one is buying his work. Yet this particular book will be a major influence on all subsequent western thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the third section of &lt;em&gt;The Gay Science&lt;/em&gt;, Nietzsche makes his most controversial claim: God is dead, and goes on to say that we killed him. While he sometimes has Christianity in his sights, the case he is making is broader than the demise of a Christian God. Nietzsche is pointing to the demise of an authority higher or above the human and making the case that belief in the divine had been killed by the gradual unfurling of the Enlightenment and the progress of human knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book and the claim had no immediate impact for there was, initially, no discernible audience. Yet the claim was prophetic. Religious belief in the West has been in gradual but continuous decline ever since. In Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s time, almost all children were baptized. Today, in England, only six per cent of the population regularly attend church.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what replaced God? Reality. A reality uncovered by observation, understanding and science. For those who have now taken leave of the notion of God, reality has a straight-forward, down to earth quality. It is the opposite of superstition. It may not have the magic and mystery of religious belief, but it enables in its place a calm, measured assessment of the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet strangely, reality, our replacement for God, turns out to share some of the key characteristics that have traditionally been applied to God. For example, God is understood to be everywhere and everything, but at the same time unknowable, elusive, unattainable. And so, it turns out, is reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A universe of fields and energy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most will accept that reality is everywhere and everything. Less obvious is that it is unknowable, elusive and unattainable. I&amp;rsquo;m a longstanding critic of philosophical realism and the notion that our language and theories are capable of describing reality. So you might expect me to claim that reality is elusive and unattainable. However, over the last few years, many leading neuroscientists working on human perception and cognition have come to similar conclusions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Beau Lotto, professor of neuroscience at the University of London, used optical illusions to demonstrate that &amp;ldquo;Our brains did not evolve to sense reality; they evolved to give us what is useful for our survival.&amp;rdquo; Donald Hoffman, professor of cognitive science at the University of California Irvine, argues that what we take to be reality is akin to icons on a desktop. &amp;ldquo;Whatever reality is, it is not what you see. What you see is just an adaptive fiction.&amp;rdquo; While David Eagleman, a Stanford neuroscientist and leading researcher into brain plasticity concludes &amp;ldquo;reality is an illusion &amp;ndash; perpetuated by our brains&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just several prominent neuroscientists. The framework of contemporary physics has also uncovered the elusive nature of reality. Once we imagined reality was ultimately made of indivisible minute particles we called atoms. Now we have a series of Chinese boxes each with smaller particles, protons, neutrons, quarks, leptons, bosons. As we examine them closer their material quality itself evaporates. Instead, we have a universe of fields and energy. It is as if we have lost the stuff of the world altogether. Niels Bohr, one of the founders of contemporary physics, concluded "Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heisenberg, one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, who won a Nobel prize for the creation of quantum mechanics, abandoned the notion that science was capable of uncovering reality altogether, &amp;ldquo;objective reality has evaporated&amp;rdquo;. More recently, Stephen Hawking, who in &lt;em&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/em&gt; had thought a theory of everything was in our grasp, abandoned this view in 2010 and concluded that science was only capable of providing models and the ultimate character of the world was beyond us. &amp;ldquo;There is no model-independent test of reality&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last century has also seen the relentless uncovery of the inability of human thought to break free from the limitation of its particular perspective. Our narratives and theories, our histories and most fundamental beliefs, have been identified as the outcome of a particular language, history and culture, and the product of particular brain chemistry and physiology. There is no human access to a God&amp;rsquo;s eye view of the world that can somehow see the world as it &amp;lsquo;really&amp;rsquo; is. Sociologists, historians and philosophers have all played their part in uncovering the profoundly limited and human character of thought and perception. So, from all sides, the idea that we have access to reality is under attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Peering behind the veil?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the puzzle over reality is even trickier than it first appears. For it initially encourages the notion that we might be able to peer behind the veil and discover the truth. Confronted with the impossibility of this task, there is a temptation to search instead for an alternative underlying hidden or non-material version of reality, as if behind the illusion we can find the real thing. This has led some to propose that reality is consciousness, or material things are also conscious. Thinkers like Donald Hoffman and Iain McGilchrist have rightly identified the extent to which our account of the world is a product of our particular brain physiology. But they then go on to toy with these idealist or panpsychist 'solutions'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But this is a wild goose chase. The new non-material 'reality' is going to be just as illusory as the materialist account. If what we take to be reality is an illusion, we are not going to be able to frame a metaphysical story that describes how it really is. Any account we give of this underlying 'reality' will itself be from a limited human perspective, and limited also by the constraints of a given language, culture, and context. &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 18th century, the hugely influential philosopher Immanuel Kant reframed the history of thought by posing the question: how must thought be structured in order for us to have knowledge? Instead, we now have to address the central question about reality by beginning from the opposite starting point &amp;ndash; that we have no knowledge and no means of reaching through to describe the ultimate character of reality. The contemporary philosophical challenge is to explain how it is possible for us to intervene with such precision and accuracy in the world, even though we cannot know how things are. How is that we are able to share and talk about a seemingly fixed and known reality? How is that you can make your way home using your previous experience or by consulting Google maps? How is it that we can invent successful vaccines or send satellites into space if our theories are not precise descriptions of an objective reality and ultimate knowledge is not possible?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is not going to be one definitive answer to this question. As if we might give a final explanation of the nature of the human condition. For to do so would at once be a description of an ultimate reality. But that does not mean that there is nothing to say. We have to attempt to provide a means to make sense of our circumstances, even while knowing that it cannot be a final account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Responding to the world&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The framework I have used to help escape from this deep puzzle, initially outlined in the book &lt;em&gt;Closure: a story of everything&lt;/em&gt;, proposes that reality should not be taken to be a thing or combination of things that we might describe. Instead it proposes that we close the openness of the world with our sensations, thoughts and language. Through this process of closure, we hold the world as things, objects and actions. People and objects, the sea and the sky, atoms and histories are not found in the world, they are instead ways by which we close the openness of the world. Language does not describe the world, instead it holds the world &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; something. Language provides us with metaphors for the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might think this is a very unlikely starting point. After all, if the world is nothing in particular, how is it that we all agree on so much? If our language and thought have nothing in common with reality, how is it that we can intervene so precisely?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the question first appears baffling, the starting point of an explanation is straight-forward. We make sense of reality not by describing it but by reacting to its consequences. Our senses do not observe the world, they respond to the world, and we hold those responses as things and characteristics through the process of closure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What the framework of openness and closure demonstrates is that we can give a detailed account of the success of our theories and beliefs without proposing that they describe how reality ultimately is. In providing this demonstration, the theory also accounts for why it is itself possible without at the same time claiming to have definitively described the nature of the human condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In abandoning the notion that our accounts of the world describe reality, we have to rethink the nature of all belief. Our theories and beliefs, our accounts of the world, are not only no longer absolute, they cannot be an attempt to be absolute. Our theories are not, to use a phrase that Hawking used when he believed in a theory of everything, a glimpse into &amp;ldquo;the mind of God&amp;rdquo;. They are instead human frameworks, created at a given point in cultural history, set in a certain language, that help us to achieve things that we would not be able to do otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Doubling down on reason&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The passing of reality is not something to regret, but something to lift our spirits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can feel confident of the value and strength of our current theories and accounts of the world, while at the same time recognising that they will in due course be modified and eventually abandoned in favour of alternatives that will be thought to be more effective, or more powerful, or more desirable. Millenia of exploration and testing of our temporary metaphors have enabled us to refine them and create versions that allow us to have lives that those in the past could hardly imagine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This ability to improve our circumstances and address our desires and goals does not need to come at the cost of limiting the world to the stories we have adopted or to imagining that there are no alternatives, or that we might have arrived at a final answer, or that there is a truth of the matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Observation and reason led us to imagine that we were uncovering the ultimate character of the world, that reality was being laid bare. It was no such thing. Instead, we were refining our closures to enable them to be more successful at predicting what would happen and helping us to intervene to achieve outcomes we could not achieve otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In contemporary culture, partly as a result of an awareness of the importance of perspective, many have become critical of observation and reason. Instead, we need to double down on observation and reason; not to uncover the truth, but to test our closures, our metaphors, our ways of holding the world. For it is only by observing where they work and where they fail that we are able to refine them &amp;ndash; or, if need be, abandon them in favour of others. Instead of being critical of observation and reason, it is the idea that we are uncovering reality that we need to abandon. The idea that there is a correct way to think. An endpoint where we can rest our account of the world. Our closures provide us with what we take to be reality but they have nothing in common with openness, and their success is not dependent on describing the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reality, it turns out, is a theological notion. An ultimate that cannot be reached. And it is time we rid ourselves of its superstition. It is not only God that is dead, but reality itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By giving up the idea of uncovering reality we can instead seek to realise the unlimited potential of openness, enabling us to achieve things we do not think currently possible. We can improve the circumstances in which we operate, and counter prejudice and injustice, but we should not imagine that we are right, or that we have said how the world is. Instead, we have offered a way of thinking that enables change, and that helps create new, different, and hopefully better futures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Postscript: The approach I have advocated here is but one way to respond to the uncovery of our inability to describe reality. There will, of course, be others. At the same time, any such account offers a means of holding the world, which has the appearance of holding fast that which in the end cannot be held at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hilary Lawson is founder of HowTheLightGetsIn festival.

    <title>The female scientists written out of history</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6106/the-female-scientists-written-out-of-history#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Rosalind Franklin" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/HRKT1E.jpg" height="1121" alt="A black and white photo of Rosalind Franklin" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the last day of February in 1953. An odd pair &amp;ndash; one a tall, lanky 25-year-old American microbiologist, the other a 37-year-old British physicist &amp;ndash; burst into the Eagle pub in Cambridge. Interrupting the lunchtime chatter of the patrons at the bar, the elder announces, without the slightest hint of irony, that they &amp;ldquo;had found the secret of life!&amp;rdquo;. That morning, 70 years ago, James Watson and Francis Crick finally cracked the double helical structure of deoxyribonucleic acid: DNA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This tale is recounted in James Watson&amp;rsquo;s 1968 account of the discovery of the structure of DNA, &lt;em&gt;The Double Helix&lt;/em&gt;. I first read the book in the 1990s, after it was recommended by one of my biochemistry lecturers. I remember being quite enthralled by the personal account of Watson&amp;rsquo;s chaotic approach to his science. It broke a stereotype I had subscribed to, that scientific endeavours have to take a linear, methodical approach. It resonated with me and my own way of working.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many years later and it was my turn to stand behind the lectern and face a theatre full of young minds. As I clicked through my slides I remembered how deeply &lt;em&gt;The Double Helix&lt;/em&gt; had influenced me and considered whether to add it to my own course&amp;rsquo;s reading list. Back in my office I dusted off my old copy of Watson&amp;rsquo;s book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time round the book had a very different effect. Watson came across as ambitious and brilliant, but also arrogant and happy to openly voice prejudices (a characteristic he displayed throughout his life). Early on in the book, he introduces his collaborators at King's College London, dedicating several pages to denigrating Rosalind Franklin &amp;ndash; whose invaluable contribution to the DNA story is now well known. He persistently calls her Rosy, a diminutive that he knew she disliked, describing how her colleague Maurice Wilkins treated her as an assistant. He finishes the chapter by saying &amp;ldquo;The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person&amp;rsquo;s lab.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Photo 51&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among her other achievements, Rosalind Franklin and her PhD student Raymond Gosling produced one of the most famous images in science: Photograph 51, a diffraction pattern created by shining X-rays through a crystal of DNA. The photo shows a blurry, spotty cross. To those initiated in crystallography, it positively screamed &amp;ldquo;helix&amp;rdquo;. But, more subtly, locked within the shape of the cross, and eventually deciphered by Franklin and Gosling, were the precise dimensions of the DNA&amp;rsquo;s form.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Photo 51 and the detailed structural information it contained became crucial to Watson and Crick&amp;rsquo;s endeavours. The pair never once conducted an experiment on DNA themselves. Instead, they took a more theoretical approach, gathering all available information and using these data to inform the building of physical, often cardboard, models. The crucial, keystone, piece of data was contained in Photo 51. This they obtained, not from Franklin, but instead from her colleague Wilkins, who shared the photo without Franklin&amp;rsquo;s permission or knowledge. The importance of the spotty cross was immediately apparent to Watson, who describes his first glimpse of it in &lt;em&gt;The Double Helix&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;The instant I saw the picture my mouth fell open and my heart began to race.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The photo was the framework into which the rest of the DNA puzzle pieces fit. It provided the three-dimensional constraints for those pieces, which when slotted into place revealed the details of the double helix.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almost a century of research informed this revelation. First, a clear understanding of DNA&amp;rsquo;s chemistry was required. This gave Watson and Crick the shape of their puzzle pieces and how they interacted with their neighbours. Second, the biological role of DNA needed to be understood. When Watson and Crick started their work, it was not at all clear that DNA carried genetic information. Instead, it was generally suspected that proteins were responsible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The concept of genetic inheritance begins with Gregor Mendel and his famous work on peas. Over the course of eight years he systematically cultivated, crossed and observed almost 30,000 plants. Eventually, he noticed patterns and arrived at some basic rules of inheritance, including the concepts of recessive and dominant genes. He published his work in 1865, but of course at the time the molecules and mechanisms that underpinned these rules were entirely unknown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Those that came before&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To find the very beginning of the thread that ties DNA with inheritance and culminates in Crick&amp;rsquo;s lunchtime proclamation in the Eagle pub, we have to go back a little earlier, and travel to T&amp;uuml;bingen, Germany. There, a laboratory led by Felix Hoppe-Seyler was busy establishing itself as the first research group in Europe dedicated to understanding the chemistry of life. At the time, this largely meant focusing on proteins, a relatively recently discovered class of biological molecule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hoppe-Seyler was a prestigious and inspiring character, who frequently changed the course of careers of aspiring scientists. Johann Friedrich Miescher had already graduated as a medical doctor but was persuaded by Hoppe-Seyler to turn from medicine towards research and join his lab (which was actually a converted kitchen) to work on physiological chemistry, as it was then known. The young Miescher was tasked with extracting proteins from leukocytes, or white blood cells. This was a rather unenviable project given that the most viable source of leukocytes was pus-soaked bandages picked out of the buckets in surgical wards. Nevertheless, Miescher diligently toiled, isolating several proteins and also something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something that had a quite different chemical composition, lacking in sulfur and plentiful in phosphorous. Something that was only found in the nucleus of cells. In reference to its source, he named the material &amp;ldquo;nuclein&amp;rdquo;. Some years later, one of Miescher&amp;rsquo;s students demonstrated that nuclein was acidic and so renamed it nucleic acid: the NA in DNA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the ever-energetic Hoppe-Seyler had upped sticks and established himself as a professor of chemistry in Strasbourg. There, he turned the head of yet another medic. The task for the convert, Albrecht Kossel, was to better understand the chemistry of Miescher&amp;rsquo;s molecule. Kossel soon worked out a formula for nuclein: C₂₉N₄₉N₉O₂₂P₃. This didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal much about the molecule&amp;rsquo;s structure. Nevertheless, Kossel&amp;rsquo;s interest was piqued. Over the course of 16 years he set about isolating the chemical components that came together to form nuclein.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One component had already been isolated from bird guano, or excrement, and had been given the name &amp;ldquo;guanine&amp;rdquo;. For the rest, Kossel needed thousands of kilos of animal organs rich in nuclein. So, he formed a relationship with a local slaughterhouse which provided him with a steady stream of pancreas and thymus. From these organs, Kossel eventually isolated &amp;ldquo;adenine&amp;rdquo;: a name derived from the Greek &amp;ldquo;adenas&amp;rdquo; meaning &amp;ldquo;gland&amp;rdquo; (in reference to the pancreas) and &amp;ldquo;ine&amp;rdquo; meaning &amp;ldquo;contains nitrogen&amp;rdquo;. From calf thymus he extracted two more compounds which he named &amp;ldquo;thymine&amp;rdquo; (after &amp;ldquo;thymus&amp;rdquo;) and &amp;ldquo;cytosine&amp;rdquo; (from &amp;ldquo;cyto&amp;rdquo; meaning cell). This nomenclature is the names of the four fundamental bases that make up DNA. And so, Kossel gave us the DNA alphabet; the letters ATGC, now so familiar to us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having isolated the building blocks of DNA, it fell to a prolific chemist, Phoebus Levene, to work out the chemistry linking them together. Over a period of two decades at the beginning of the 20th century, Levene investigated the building blocks of nucleic acids and revealed that they are composed of just three distinct chemical components. A phosphate group, a five carbon sugar, and one of the four bases (guanine, adenine, cytosine and thymine). Just as importantly, Levene also worked out how the components were linked together to form what he called &amp;ldquo;nucleotides&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite DNA being under their noses (and up them too, given the prevalence of bird poo and offal), none of the big players &amp;ndash; including Kossel, Miescher and Levene &amp;ndash; understood its true significance. They were still convinced that only proteins were large and complicated enough to carry genetic information. Their research on DNA, therefore, was a sideline. Many believed it to be a storage molecule for phosphorous, or maybe a structural molecule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Paving the way&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others very nearly uncovered DNA&amp;rsquo;s true role. As early as 1927, the great Russian biologist Nikolai Koltsov came uncannily close to the truth in his description of the mechanism by which DNA replicates and stores information. He predicted that inheritance would occur via a &amp;ldquo;giant hereditary molecule&amp;rdquo; consisting of &amp;ldquo;two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template&amp;rdquo;. But despite his extraordinary insight into the mechanisms of inheritance, Koltsov was not able to go against the dominant scientific thinking of the time, and like everyone else presumed that proteins were the agents that stored genetic information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the dogma was slowly shifting. The idea that DNA might have a role in inheritance was beginning to be expressed. One frequently overlooked voice was that of Florence Bell. In 1939, she was a PhD student in the lab of William Astbury, a professor in Leeds with a prestigious reputation for his work on the structure of fibres. In Bell&amp;rsquo;s doctoral thesis, which was focused on the X-ray diffraction of nucleic acids, she wrote: &amp;ldquo;Possibly the most pregnant development in molecular biology is the realisation that the beginnings of life are closely associated with the interaction of proteins and nucleic acids.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell&amp;rsquo;s work paved the way for Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling. She produced the first X-ray images of DNA. The images are blurry because, unbeknownst to Bell and Astbury (and everyone else), DNA could take two subtly different structures, and their sample contained a mixture of both. Nevertheless the image revealed that DNA adopted a regular structure and allowed them to determine some key dimensions of the molecule, specifically the distances between the As, Ts, Gs and Cs, in each step of the DNA ladder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell and Astbury&amp;rsquo;s Nature paper in 1938 described these DNA nucleotides as being stacked like &amp;ldquo;a pile of pennies&amp;rdquo;. This information fed directly into Watson and Crick&amp;rsquo;s models. Unfortunately, Bell&amp;rsquo;s work was curtailed by the outbreak of the Second World War. She joined the Women&amp;rsquo;s Auxiliary Air Force as a radio operator, later married a US serviceman, emigrated and worked as an industrial chemist in Texas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a strange footnote to the history of the Astbury lab. Following the war and having lost valued researchers such as Bell (whom he had tried his best to retain), Astbury rebuilt his group and in 1951 received fresh samples of DNA. He directed another PhD student, Elwyn Beighton, to shine X-rays through them, just as Bell had done over a decade before. This new sample contained just one form of DNA, and so it was much sharper than Bell&amp;rsquo;s images. Beighton&amp;rsquo;s photograph is near enough identical to Photo 51, but precedes it by a year. Bizarrely, however, Astbury showed very little interest in the photo and so never published or even presented it at a meeting. Had he done so, the Nobel prizes and familiar names associated with the structure of DNA might have been quite different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Too little, too late&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A breakthrough was needed. It came in 1944 when Oswald Avery, Colin Macleod and Maclyn McCarty carried out a meticulous study showing that the characteristics of a bacterium could be altered by &amp;ldquo;transforming&amp;rdquo; it with DNA and only DNA. The final nail in the coffin was the theory of protein-based inheritance, hammered home by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey with their famous &amp;ldquo;blender experiment&amp;rdquo; in the early 1950s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time it was known that bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) are comprised of a protein shell encapsulating DNA. Chase and Hershey &amp;ldquo;tagged&amp;rdquo; the protein and DNA, by introducing radioactive isotopes of sulfur to the protein, and radioactive phosphorous to the DNA. This labelling system allowed them to follow the whereabouts of the different molecules. They then infected bacteria with their radioactive phages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The phage rapidly proliferated inside the infected bacteria, indicating some form of genetic material had been transmitted to the bacteria. Traces of radioactivity could only be detected in bacteria that had been infected with labelled DNA, and not the labelled protein, clearly indicating that DNA and only DNA had been injected into the bacteria. The pair went on to categorically prove that DNA originated from the phage by whizzing the broth of newly infected bacteria in a modified kitchen blender. This knocked the phage off the surface of the bacteria. When they then looked for the location of the labelled protein, it was in solution, along with the now empty phage capsules, whilst the labelled DNA had been injected into the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, Chase and Hershey conclusively showed that DNA was the molecule of inheritance. Hershey went on to win a Nobel Prize in 1969. Sadly, in yet another story of women losing out, Martha Chase went on to lose her job and leave science, at the age of 37. Little more of her life is on record, apart from a few obituaries when she passed away in 2003.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without Chase and Hershey&amp;rsquo;s insights into the secrets of life, it is doubtful that James Watson and Frances Crick would have put so much effort into DNA. When Hershey died in 1997, Watson said in a memorial article that &amp;ldquo;the Hershey-Chase experiment . . . made me ever more certain that finding the three-dimensional structure of DNA was biology&amp;rsquo;s next important objective.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent times, more light has been thrown on the contribution of women scientists to the story of DNA. However, it can feel like too little, too late. It took the best part of 70 years for Rosalind Franklin&amp;rsquo;s contributions to be fully appreciated. Often described as the &amp;ldquo;Dark Lady of DNA&amp;rdquo;, Franklin has now been the subject of multiple biographies. In 2015, Nicole Kidman played her in a West End show named &amp;ldquo;Photograph 51&amp;rdquo; after Franklin&amp;rsquo;s famous image.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a shame that Martha Chase and Florence Bell, who provided equally important insights and influence, are not as widely recognised. The pivotal blender experiment does bear Chase&amp;rsquo;s name, but most people who are familiar with the experiment are unaware that Chase was a woman. Meanwhile, Florence Bell remains almost entirely unknown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Double Helix&lt;/em&gt;, Watson claims it was Crick who rushed into a nearby pub and blurted out that they had found the &amp;ldquo;secret of life&amp;rdquo;. The announcement in the Eagle pub has since gone down in scientific history. According to Gosling, when Rosalind Franklin heard about it a few days later, she commented, &amp;ldquo;We all stand on each other&amp;rsquo;s shoulders.&amp;rdquo; Quite whose shoulders she meant we cannot know, but I like to think she was paying tribute to the likes of Bell, Chase, Gosling, Miescher, Kossel, Levene and many more besides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>In a word: Memoir</title>

We have an alternative word that is used in a similar way: &amp;ldquo;autobiography&amp;rdquo;. But &amp;ldquo;memoir&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;memoirs&amp;rdquo;, used interchangeably, seem to have become more popular. Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s an echo of &amp;ldquo;memory&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;remember&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;reminisce&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;memento&amp;rdquo; in the word &amp;ldquo;memoir&amp;rdquo;. We often forget that the meaning of words is not really like a bar of chocolate with the word &amp;ldquo;chocolate&amp;rdquo; on the label. Words work in our minds (or we do the work on words) through connotations, connected to our experiences of life and of other words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cluster of &amp;ldquo;mem&amp;rdquo; words owes its origins to the Ancient Greek goddess of memory, Mnemosyne, and to an even more ancient word in Proto-Indo-European &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;men&amp;rdquo; meaning &amp;ldquo;to think&amp;rdquo;. More recently than this, &amp;ldquo;memoir&amp;rdquo; came to us via 12th-century French. It was first used in English (Middle English as it was then) to mean a memorandum &amp;ndash; as with diplomats passing notes to each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its use to describe a life story, or an account of events, starts a little later. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, in 1659 one J. Pearson wrote that &amp;ldquo;Pontius Pilate kept the Memoirs of Jewish affairs&amp;rdquo;. By 1762, we have Lawrence Sterne writing in the inimitable and ground-breaking novel Tristram Shandy about the &amp;ldquo;memoirs of my uncle Toby&amp;rsquo;s courtship&amp;rdquo;. Leap forward another century to 1818 and Samuel Smith comments, &amp;ldquo;Any one who provides good dinners for clever people, and remembers what they say, cannot fail to write entertaining memoirs.&amp;rdquo; Scientists found a parallel use for the word, to refer to the proceedings of a learned society, and so we find memoirs on a &amp;ldquo;petrifaction mixed with shells&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;a Michigan mud-hole&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the weather of Scotland&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A wisecrack credited to, of all people, Marshal P&amp;eacute;tain (the head of Vichy France 1940-44) appeared in the Observer in 1946: &amp;ldquo;To write one&amp;rsquo;s memoirs is to speak ill of everybody except oneself.&amp;rdquo; Reluctant as people might be to quote P&amp;eacute;tain as an authority, this thought seems to have survived the test of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How have the protests changed Iran?</title>

Credit: Taymaz Valley" width="966"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soraya Lennie is a journalist, analyst and author of "Crooked Alleys: Deliverance and Despair in Iran".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The protests in Iran began in September of last year, sparked by the death of a young woman in police custody. What did they grow to encompass? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The protests were about issues much larger than compulsory hijab, or dislike of the morality police. The death in custody of Mahsa Amini was of course the spark, but arguably the protests represent the continuing decline in public perception vis a vis the legitimacy of the state and those who hold power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Widespread protests largely fizzled out after a couple of months but quickly evolved into a campaign for change. Ultimately, in a leaderless movement, the motivations and desires of individuals differ, but generally speaking, the demands from those who took to the streets in Iran are similar: end morality policing, impunity and the compulsory hijab &amp;ndash; and overhaul, if not end, the current system of the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The overall campaign is now one of civil disobedience, where many supporters chant sporadic slogans against the Supreme Leader and state and no longer wear hijab in public. The number of activists inside Iran who are speaking out and risking arrest and prison, has also grown. There is also significant support for a referendum on a new constitution &amp;ndash; which is the legal avenue to dismantle the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your book &amp;ldquo;Crooked Alleys&amp;rdquo; you paint a picture of an Islamic Republic that is a prisoner of its past. Are the protests the sign of a younger generation demanding a better future? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iran is a prisoner of the past due to US foreign policy since the hostage crisis [in 1979], and its own belligerent and caustic reaction. It is a complex issue, but generational change in Iran means less people have a personal stake in maintaining the debilitating status quo. They are less inclined to cling to the rationales and ideologies of the past which have helped paralyse Iran&amp;rsquo;s progress, both internally and externally. Less and less people care about yesterday&amp;rsquo;s revolutionaries, or even the Iran-Iraq war mythology, and thus are much more focused on the present, and on their own futures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generational change is an exceptional driver of new ideas anywhere, but in Iran, it is absolutely crucial in advancing the pro-democracy movement. They have injected new life into a movement for change that has gone nowhere the last 15 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How extensive has the government crackdown been, and have women faced the brunt of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iran&amp;rsquo;s own Judiciary Chief suggests more than 22,000 people were arrested in the crackdown. Human rights groups say more than 500 people, including dozens of security forces, were killed. The crackdown doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be focused on one gender or another, as both men and women protested &amp;ndash; and faced arrest and prison &amp;ndash; together. Further, dozens of photographers and journalists have also been jailed &amp;ndash; both men and women. The difference is, in many cases it is generally easier to identify a woman involved in an act of civil disobedience by virtue of appearance [including whether or not she wears the hijab], than it is a man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special rapporteur Javaid Rehman has told the UN Human Rights Council that the violations since the protests began amount to &amp;ldquo;crimes against humanity&amp;rdquo;. Does this seem justified?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Rome Statute is rather generalised. In Iran&amp;rsquo;s case, there is evidence of torture and specifically, of security forces intentionally committing inhumane acts &amp;ndash; a crime against humanity. Specifically blinding protesters with bird shot, beating civilians and subjecting thousands to arbitrary arrest. Further, many people, including journalists, were convicted of crimes in sham trials void of transparency or due process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Iranians have rallied around Reza Pahlavi, the son of the Shah, to lead a transitional government from clerical to secular rule. Why do others argue that this would be bad for democracy? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several issues here; first, this is a diaspora project, not an indigenous Iranian one and I&amp;rsquo;ve not seen much support for it inside the country. Iran&amp;rsquo;s most legitimate civil rights activists are in jail or under house arrest, not in the United States. Second, detractors argue that Mr Pahlavi has never held elected office so doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the political credentials. Third, millions of Iranians already lament replacing one dictatorship with another (the crown for the turban) and therefore argue another unelected group or individual is the antithesis of progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lastly, many people assume &amp;ndash; as does the charter that Mr Pahlavi and other diaspora have issued &amp;ndash; that Iranians want a &amp;lsquo;secular-democratic system.&amp;rsquo; Although the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, there is no data that proves this is what an overwhelming majority of Iranians want. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think his participation as an elected official in any future Iranian system &amp;ndash; based on consensus of the Iranian people &amp;ndash; is bad for democracy, so long as he is elected in a free and fair vote, like anyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was originally around security and &amp;ldquo;religious discipline&amp;rdquo;. What is their current role in society?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The role of the IRGC is to protect the revolution, which is embodied by the Supreme Leader, and protect the revolution&amp;rsquo;s ideals &amp;ndash; independence, freedom and Islamic Republic. However, its role changed when Ruhollah Khomeini died in 1989, and Ali Khamenei replaced him as Supreme Leader. Although the constitution forbids active IRGC members from political activity or groups, IRGC figures are involved in every key branch of the Islamic Republic system, from the judiciary and parliament to intelligence. Further, the IRGC has morphed into an economic cartel with outsized power and leverage, even over pillars of the revolution and the clergy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it possible to tackle their power, without reforming the state? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, no. Constitutional amendments in 1982 have ensured that. Certain articles gave the IRGC outsized power with no real checks and balances. Further, the Corps reports to the Supreme Leader, not the Ministry of Defence. It also operates its own intelligence wing, often in competition with the state&amp;rsquo;s Ministry of Intelligence. Further, it&amp;rsquo;s full budget is not subject to public parliamentary scrutiny, stripping away another layer of accountability, while increasing its already formidable role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February was the 44th anniversary of the 1979 revolution. The government used it as a show of might and to send the message that they had won, and the protests are now a spent force. How true is that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The anniversary of the revolution in theory, is a celebration of freedom and independence from foreign domination &amp;ndash; widely supported concepts. But it is also a propaganda tool used by the state and its supporters to cling to legitimacy and a long dead revolutionary mythology. The most telling element at these events, is the absence of the many millions of Iranians who fought for the revolution, who are now disillusioned, if not repulsed by the system they helped create.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the protests, they were not as large nor as widespread as those seen, for example, in 2009. Any significant showing ended about two months after the death of Mahsa Amini &amp;ndash; aside from in Zahedan. In essence, the protests are over, and did not lead to systematic change. But the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot claim it has won anything &amp;ndash; in fact the opposite. The number of Iranians who view the country&amp;rsquo;s circle of elite as illegitimate has grown exponentially and this rift between the people and the state is arguably, beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are reports that thousands of women are now openly breaking the law and refusing to wear the hijab. What impact have the protests had on the general population in Iran? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Millions of Iranian women weren&amp;rsquo;t abiding by the letter of the law for decades and in the past ten years, it was common to see unveiled women at cafes, art galleries, and even walking down the street. Despite arrests, threats and even attacks from members of the public, the protests have emboldened more women to follow suit. The protests broke another layer of fear in the Islamic Republic and the importance of that cannot be understated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soraya Lennie is the author of &lt;a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/crooked-alleys/"&gt;Crooked Alleys: Deliverance and Despair in Iran&lt;/a&gt; (Hurst Publishers). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Britain's Jews</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6104/book-review-britains-jews#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Floor tiles at Garnethill Synagogue" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2K1GF26.jpg" height="863" alt="Floor tiles inside Garnethill Synagogue, Glasgow" width="1300"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britain&amp;rsquo;s Jews: Confidence, Maturity, Anxiety&lt;/strong&gt; (Bloomsbury) by Harry Freedman&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recent release of the 2021 England and Wales census figures for religion and ethnicity led to the usual debates about who &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; are now. While particular findings attracted attention &amp;ndash; most notably, that self-identifying Christians are now in the minority &amp;ndash; the census holds a deeper allure. By describing the population as a series of coherent, easily identifiable groups, it holds out the comforting promise that we might be able to understand the messy diversity of this nation (or nations).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This desire to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; the population, to pin the butterfly, conceals much harder questions as to how we might come to comprehend the collective identities that people actually hold. The case of British Jews &amp;ndash; the ethno-religious group I both belong to and write about &amp;ndash; is particularly illuminating. The contrast between what people think they know about Jews and what they actually know is often perilously stark.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a paradox in how Jews are made visible in contemporary Britain. On the one hand, we have never been more present in national debates than in the last decade or so, largely due to debates about antisemitism. Individual British Jews &amp;ndash; from comedian David Baddiel to historian Simon Schama &amp;ndash; are more visible and more talkative about their Jewish identities. Yet this visibility conceals much of who British Jews actually are. Jews are visible if they are strictly Orthodox men in black hats, if they are defiantly secular media personalities, or if they are campaigning about antisemitism. Beyond that, the great mass of Jewish life is usually invisible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harry Freedman&amp;rsquo;s new book &lt;em&gt;Britain&amp;rsquo;s Jews: Confidence, Maturity, Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; helps to fill in the picture. Volumes that take an overview of contemporary British Jewish life as a whole are surprisingly few (&lt;em&gt;Turbulent Times: The British Jewish Community Today&lt;/em&gt;, which I wrote with Ben Gidley, came out in 2010 and was the first book-length sociological study of the community in decades). That means that Freedman can&amp;rsquo;t take anything for granted about the background knowledge of his non-Jewish readers. He writes clearly and knows the community inside and out, but the book is full of detail that readers may find engrossing, but which they might equally find dull or simply odd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The British Jewish community contains a bewildering alphabet soup of organisations. Explaining the difference between the Liberal and Reform movements is a challenge even for their rabbinic leaders. Given that organisations like the Board of Deputies or the Chief Rabbi are often the targets of non-Jewish (and sometimes Jewish) suspicion, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to go into some detail as to whom they do or do not represent. But I felt a nagging anxiety that Freedman&amp;rsquo;s guide to the community&amp;rsquo;s structures might tax the patience of the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the confusion inherent in conveying this array of organisations and their arcane politics is the point &amp;ndash; maybe that is actually what being Jewish is. But to convey that reality in a compelling style may be a challenge too far. At the same time, as someone who has worked in the British Jewish community for many years, I inevitably noted which individuals and Jewish organisations Freedman doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fairness, &lt;em&gt;Britain&amp;rsquo;s Jews&lt;/em&gt; is not intended as a comprehensive guidebook. Freedman has a larger theme that he wishes to explore: the seeming paradox that Jewish life in Britain seems to be thriving, at the same time as British Jews are increasingly speaking publicly about antisemitism. The struggles with the Labour Party during the Corbyn years saw an unprecedented institutional effort across the Jewish community to articulate its concerns in vehement terms (with, of course, a significant proportion of Jews dissenting). This was the action of a self-confident and well-organised community. The duality has bewildered and sometimes angered many non-Jews, particularly on the left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an exceptionally sensitive issue and Freedman&amp;rsquo;s overall positivity about Jewish life in Britain has been received with some murmurs of disquiet within the community (both about downplaying the threat of antisemitism and about not giving enough attention to the more problematic aspects of the community). There are old fears at work here: that a complex picture of Jewish reality will undermine the unified messaging that Jews require to survive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no way around it, though. Some aspects of British Jewish life do seem odd to outsiders. Freedman demonstrates the common (if slowly declining) tendency of British Jews to belong to synagogues whose values they do not actually share. Most members of the United Synagogue &amp;ndash; the largest Orthodox body, whose spiritual head is the Chief Rabbi &amp;ndash; are not themselves Orthodox. It is as if secular liberals chose to affiliate to the evangelical branch of the Church of England.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his attempt to capture what everyday Jewish life actually feels like, Freedman quotes his interviewees at length. But the book was written during the pandemic and the Zoom interviews don&amp;rsquo;t compensate for the lack of portraits of the spaces in which Jewish life is lived. This is important, as the aspects of that life that may seem bizarre to outsiders make much more sense when you see them &amp;ldquo;in action&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;Britain&amp;rsquo;s Jews&lt;/em&gt; made me wonder whether my own understanding of other ethnic and religious minorities might be shaped by accounts that leave out the texture of everyday life. While reading books can provide a starting point for understanding what it is to be Muslim, Sikh or Afro-Caribbean in Britain today, they are no substitute for the experiential knowledge that we need to understand the other more deeply. Without the texture of everyday life, all we are left with is a much more detailed version of the kind of knowledge that the census provides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
