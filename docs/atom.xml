    <title>Ken Ham is right!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/06/01/ken-ham-is-right/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">I bet you never thought you’d see me writing that, did you? Ham has always insisted on a rigidly applied set of doctrines that may not be questioned — any doubt about any one Christian claim will lead to the whole house of cards collapsing. The Washington Post demonstrates the validity of that argument with this article, <a href="https://wapo.st/3qihe1s">The Revolt of Christian Homeschoolers</a>.</p>
<p>It’s about a couple in Virginia, Christina and Aaron Beall, who were brought up in an ultraconservative faith, with all the usual restrictions: women will submit to the man, public schools were evil, contraception was bad (she got pregnant within weeks of getting married.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Aaron had grown up believing Christians could out-populate atheists and Muslims by scorning birth control; Christina had been taught the Bible-based arithmetic necessary to calculate the age of a universe less than 8,000 years old. Their education was one in which dinosaurs were herded aboard Noah’s ark — and in which the penalty for doubt or disobedience was swift. Sometimes they still flinched when they remembered their parents’ literal adherence to the words of the Old Testament: “Do not withhold correction from a child, for if you beat him with a rod, he will not die.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/aimee-beall.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/aimee-beall-88x150.jpg" alt="" width="88" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-70288" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/aimee-beall-88x150.jpg 88w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/aimee-beall-176x300.jpg 176w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/06/aimee-beall.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 88px) 100vw, 88px"/></a></p>
<p>What broke their faith was that last bit: the rod. They could not beat their children. And if whupping their kids with a stick was wrong, what else could be wrong about their faith? So they enrolled their daughter in &lt;gasp&gt; <em>public school</em>. She thrived and was happy. And they discovered that their religion had lied to them about schooling.</p>
<blockquote><p>“People who think the public schools are indoctrinating don’t know what indoctrination is. We were indoctrinated,” Aaron says. “It’s not even comparable.”</p></blockquote>
<p>They kept on learning.</p>
<blockquote><p>Her loss of faith in the biblical literalism and patriarchal values of her childhood was coming in the way the movement’s adherents had always warned it would: through exposure to people with different experiences and points of view.</p>
<p>Those people just happened to be her daughter and her husband.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article says they didn’t question Christianity, so they didn’t become godless atheists or anything horrible like that, but they did become significantly more open-minded and are now reading more than the Bible and awful books like Bill Gothard’s or Michael and Debi Pearl’s. Now look at what they’re reading.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stacks of books on the living room’s end tables testified to their belated efforts at self-education: popular works by the biologists Neil Shubin and Robert Sapolsky, as well as “Raising Critical Thinkers” by Julie Bogart, a leading developer of home education materials who has criticized conservative Christian home-schooling groups. </p></blockquote>
<p>Poor Ken Ham. He was right that any lapse in dedication to his interpretation of Christianity would lead to apostasy, but he’s probably sitting in a dark corner, hissing and gnashing his teeth and flicking his forked tail if he hears about the Bealls. One family has escaped his grasp!</p>

    <title>Book review: Victory City by Salman Rushdie</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6126/book-review-victory-city-by-salman-rushdie#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Salman Rushdie. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/T67N9Y.jpg" height="1279" alt="A photo portrait of Salman Rushdie" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victory City&lt;/strong&gt; (Penguin Books) by Salman Rushdie&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1989, Iran&amp;rsquo;s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa on Salman Rushdie and his publishers for his novel &lt;em&gt;The Satanic Verses&lt;/em&gt;, claiming his depiction of a Muhammad-like figure was blasphemous. The international writers&amp;rsquo; organisation PEN was instrumental in the campaign calling for Rushdie&amp;rsquo;s protection and for his inalienable right to free expression to be recognised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, I became director of English PEN&amp;rsquo;s Writers in Prison Committee and witnessed for myself Rushdie&amp;rsquo;s dedication to persecuted writers worldwide. He was always a signatory on our petitions and served as president of American PEN from 2004 to 2006. Today, he is a patron of Humanists UK and a laureate of the International Academy of Humanism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last summer, Rushdie was brutally attacked at a literary event in New York state, leaving him blinded in one eye. Months later &lt;em&gt;Victory City&lt;/em&gt;, his latest novel, was published. Words endure. The pen is indeed mightier than the sword.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Victory City&lt;/em&gt; is an epic tale with a feminist slant. The novel&amp;rsquo;s protagonist is Pampa Kampana, a fictitious poet and prophetess who creates an empire, and then writes about its rise and fall in a narrative poem called the Jayaparajaya. The poem is buried in a clay pot sealed with wax and unearthed four and a half centuries later. Rushdie cleverly frames &lt;em&gt;Victory City&lt;/em&gt; as a version of her-story, rather than his-story, retold in plainer language by &amp;ldquo;a spinner of yarns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The novel opens in 14th-century southern India. Nine-year-old Pampa witnesses her mother burning to death as part of a mass suicide after their kingdom is defeated. Orphaned, she is blessed by the goddess Parvati and later reaches a monk&amp;rsquo;s cave dwelling, where she lives for nine years with a scholar, Vidyasagar, who abuses her: &amp;ldquo;He did not do it often, because scholarship usually left him too tired to do much about his lusts, but he did it often enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When she comes of age Pampa sows a city, Vijayanagar (Sanskrit for victory city), using a bag of magical seeds, and whispers its people into existence. It becomes known as Bisnaga. During her lifetime &amp;ndash; she dies aged 240 &amp;ndash; Pampa attempts to give women equal rights in a patriarchal world. She promotes education for all and religious tolerance. The arts are seen as essential and female warriors are as much to be feared as their male counterparts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pampa gives birth to three daughters with her lover, a dashing Portuguese trader, whom she prioritises over the three arrogant sons she has with the second king of Bisnaga. She insists their &amp;ldquo;barbarian&amp;rdquo; sons are sent away. War is waged against neighbours, battles are won and lost. After the king&amp;rsquo;s death, Pampa is herself exiled and lives in an enchanted forest with her three daughters and two loyal servants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fantastical elements are woven throughout the narrative. As well as magic seeds, there are talking birds, a forest goddess and troublesome pink monkeys. Pampa bides her time and returns to Bisnaga 132 years later, becoming Queen Regent. The kingdom flourishes under her rule. Later her despotic husband has her blinded with red-hot irons &amp;ndash; particularly chilling, given Rushdie&amp;rsquo;s own fate. Inevitably, with Pampa weakened, the empire declines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rushdie is finely tuned to the political manoeuvrings that allow tyranny to flourish: &amp;ldquo;the blurring between the worship of the god and the devotion felt for the king&amp;rdquo;, the repression of fundamental human rights, the renaming of streets, and using religion as &amp;ldquo;a tool for the maintenance of social control.&amp;rdquo; The rulers come from a mixed stock, including cowherds and soldiers, and dynasties can change overnight. Rushdie also plays with different registers of tone and language. Passages of lyrical prose are followed by modern idiom &amp;ndash; one character might say &amp;ldquo;fuck&amp;rdquo;, another punctuates their sentences with &amp;ldquo;isn&amp;rsquo;t it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I imagine &lt;em&gt;Victory City&lt;/em&gt; will divide readers, as it has critics. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenging read, but one that celebrates the power of storytelling. Pampa&amp;rsquo;s conclusion echoes Rushdie&amp;rsquo;s lifelong belief: &amp;ldquo;Words are the only victors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p class="lead">I know it’s not as impressive as the <a href="https://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/">mammoth</a>, but it gives AMAB people an edge in rugby, therefore trans athletes should be banned. So saith Sean Ingle, chief sportswriter for <a href="https://transwrites.world/guardian-writers-and-editor-set-up-group-to-make-guardian-more-transphobic/">the increasingly transphobic Guardian</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>As he repeated many lies about trans women in sport, whether through ignorance or malice, Ingle said, <q>And going back to the start with the science is to have a separate, exclusive, preserved category for natal females with trans women and trans men then going into an open, universal category. And those that support this approach point to the recent science that suggests that even when testosterone is reduced, strength in transgender women only goes down 5%.</q></p>
<p><q>Most of that advantage for male puberty is retained. They also point out, and I hear this a lot, that women are not men with lower testosterone. They point out there are thousands of physical differences between males and females, and they aren’t always obvious.</q></p>
<p><q>Females tend to have better peripheral vision than males. Males, in contrast, are quite as fast[sic?] at accurately detecting the trajectory of a moving object. That is, how fast it’s moving, in which direction it’s moving, and where it’s going to be 1 second from now.</q></p>
<p><q>That’s helpful when you’re trying to chuck a spear at a rabbit. If you’re going back to evolutionary biology times, it’s also helpful when you’re trying to intercept a rugby ball. My general view here is that The Guardian should be at the heart of all this and that we should write about the subject fearlessly.</q></p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, even sportswriters have absorbed the biases of evolutionary psychology. Now men, not women, have evolved to be better at throwing spears.</p>
<p>These glib comparisons always make me wonder what was being compared in these studies. <em>All</em> women tend to have better peripheral vision than men? What if you compared men, in general, to women tennis players? Is it still true? Isn’t it quite likely that peripheral vision, and the ability to calculate trajectories, are plastic and responsive to practice?</p>
<p>Also, how large is the variation within men, and within women? Aren’t we really dealing with selected subsets of populations, making blanket claims about the aggregate abilities of diverse populations rather problematic?</p>
<p>The whole premise is flawed. It assumes that men of the paleolithic were specifically and exclusively selected for spear chucking, that women of that time had no use for that talent, and that some epigenetic factor inhibits the genetic spear-chucking complex in women. No evidence for any of that. Then we have to assume that there was no further selection for or against that complex for 100,000 years — men retained a fairly specific ability through many generations of life farming. Then we assume further that whatever epigenetic modifiers allow for enhanced spearchucking in men, they don’t include things like testosterone that might be blocked by inhibitors — these hypothetical male advantages sail through everything that affects trans women unaffected.</p>
<p>But sure, if you’re an evolutionary psychologist sportswriter, you can just propose that whole chain of improbabilities as a given and call it “science” or “biology,” all in the name of transphobia. I call it magical thinking.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="An AI-generated image from Boris Eldagsen's controversial ongoing series, 'Pseudomnesia'" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/boris_eldagsen_THETIE_s-copy.jpg" height="600" alt="An AI-generated image from Boris Eldagsen's controversial ongoing series, 'Pseudomnesia', which shows a black and white, hyper-realistic image of a man and a woman with their arms around each other" width="508"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recent release to the public of a wave of new art and writing tools, such as DALL-E and ChatGPT, has been greeted with an outpouring of alarmist rhetoric. The software, based on artificial intelligence, responds to prompts like &amp;ldquo;create a picture of a woman eating salad and laughing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll&amp;rdquo; by searching the web for examples and building on these to create an approximation: an image (though often disturbingly mangled) or something like a poem (at least in the sense that it rhymes). Sometimes the prompt works well and the production can seem magical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sceptics have been horrified. &amp;ldquo;AI in art&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;a creditless, thankless, and soulless alternative to the real thing,&amp;rdquo; Jade King complains in the &lt;em&gt;Gamer&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Writing in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, musician and producer T-Bone Burnett and author Jonathan Taplin worry that AI threatens &amp;ldquo;the core creative act&amp;rdquo; which if &amp;ldquo;radically diminished, or replaced&amp;hellip; will stop culture in its tracks.&amp;rdquo; The underlying fear here is that artificial intelligence will rise up, exploit and replace us. Art &amp;ndash; real art &amp;ndash; is deeply human. These new tools, which scrape the web for content, simply remix and remash without any personal, individual spark.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are real concerns about the way AI picks up source material without payment, just as there were reasonable concerns about the way that early hip-hop artists lifted source tracks without recompensing the original creators. Art under capitalism, like most labour under capitalism, is monetised in ways that benefit those at the top and grind down those at the bottom, and new tech is quickly subverted to that purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exploitation, though, isn&amp;rsquo;t new. Nor is it inhuman. On the contrary, the exploitation of artists is often rationalised by the pretence of art as unquenchable and unbindable individualism. Our most famous music artists may sing about being rebellious and free, but are often trapped in contracts involving financial exploitation, or worse (the latest case being pop star Kesha, accusing her producer of physical and sexual abuse.) If art is your soul, then the business of art is selling your soul, which has some obvious downsides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why not, instead, embrace the mechanism? Forget originality and the divine afflatus. If the AI is going to control us all, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we be working to become the AI? Let us seize the means of production of ourselves!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the essential argument of the wonderful &lt;em&gt;Against Expression&lt;/em&gt;, a 590-page anthology of &amp;ldquo;uncreative writing&amp;rdquo; edited by poets Craig Dworkin and Kenneth Goldsmith. Published more than a decade ago, in 2011, it holds some valuable insights for our own fraught cultural moment. The writing in the book is &amp;ldquo;uncreative&amp;rdquo; for the same reason that AI art is often labeled as such. The 100-odd authors in the book create their poems by cutting up or lifting text from other sources: literature, internet detritus, grammar books, psychological testing instruments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The anthology demonstrates the long and rich tradition of such practices. The &amp;ldquo;writers&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; including William Burroughs, Kathy Acker, Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol and Claudia Rankine &amp;ndash; find text and then remix and recontextualise. They are less like Byron (&amp;ldquo;Yet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying,/streams like the thunderstorm against the wind&amp;rdquo;) and more like, say, ChatGPT, trawling the internet for content to slice up, rewrite and misinterpret.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite poems from the anthology is an excerpt from Rory Macbeth&amp;rsquo;s 2007 book &lt;em&gt;The Bible (alphabetized)&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s exactly what the title says: a list of every word in the Bible in alphabetical order, including eight pages of: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The different authors in the volume aren&amp;rsquo;t different because they have different identities and unique voices. They&amp;rsquo;re different because they draw from different data sets. Macbeth uses the Bible. Nada Gordon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Abnormal Discharge&amp;rdquo; (first published in the anthology itself) reproduces post titles from the Women&amp;rsquo;s Health Forum message board (&amp;ldquo;possible pregnancy/vaginal discharge Jessica/Abnormal Pap Smear Jennifer/Abnormal Pap&amp;rdquo;). H. L. Hix&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;God Bless&lt;/em&gt; (2007) is a book of poems entirely composed of phrases from the speeches of George W. Bush and the public statements of Osama bin Laden. Claude Cosky&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The First Thousand Numbers Classified in Alphabetical Order&amp;rdquo; begins with &amp;ldquo;Eight, eight-hundred, eight hundred and eight&amp;rdquo; and ends with &amp;ldquo;two-hundred and two.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I personally find this impersonal approach to writing exhilarating. I laughed out loud at all those &amp;ldquo;be&amp;rdquo;s. I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;I never realised that eight was the first number in the alphabetical order.&amp;rdquo; But if you are not, like me, a neurodivergent oddball, you may well be less convinced. Why would anyone read this? Why would anyone write it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Co-editor Goldsmith is most famous for &amp;ldquo;Day&amp;rdquo;, a 2003 poem in which he wrote out the entirety of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; from 1 September 2000. He argues in the preface to &lt;em&gt;After Expression&lt;/em&gt; that the rise of uncreative writing is in part a reaction to the increasing manipulability and algorithmicisation of text made possible by the internet. &amp;ldquo;Never before has language had so much materiality &amp;ndash; fluidity, plasticity, malleability &amp;ndash; begging to be actively managed by the writer.&amp;rdquo; T-Bone Burnett sees AI as eating away at originality as it hoovers up old art and spews out garbled and rearranged (but still old) art. Goldsmith, in contrast, thinks the ease of hoovering and spewing is itself a new kind of creation and a new kind of creativity. Which is really more creative: writing (yet another) lyric poem about lost love, or listing every word in the Bible alphabetically?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poetry compiled in &lt;em&gt;Against Expression&lt;/em&gt; is a system or a process. When Robert Fitterman rewrites Ernest Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s 1926 novel &lt;em&gt;The Sun Also Rises&lt;/em&gt; by removing all sentences except for those that begin with the pronoun &amp;ldquo;I,&amp;rdquo; he is both removing the self from literature and centering the self in literature. Is he mocking Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s self-absorption? Enjoying it? Replacing it with his own? It&amp;rsquo;s all of those, I would argue, and also just a joke that makes you laugh &amp;ndash; at once an intimate and universal, and therefore impersonal, response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, when Dan Farrell turns a psychological diagnostic tool into a series of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; statements (&amp;ldquo;I do things that keep me from becoming physically unhealthy. I feel angry. I am pretty angry about things these days&amp;rdquo;), the voice is an eerie mirror of self and soul. There is an &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s not an &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s just an algorithm, a grammatical convenience. The effect is poignant, repulsive, beautiful, uncanny, hard to categorise &amp;ndash; like poetry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To dismiss AI art as &amp;ldquo;soulless&amp;rdquo; is to assume that the purpose of art is to demonstrate soul, to validate a romantic personhood at the centre of culture and existence. But, as &lt;em&gt;Against Expression&lt;/em&gt; shows by its inclusion of works by figures like Samuel Beckett and W. B. Yeats, the presence of the soul in art has long been an object of scepticism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a call for tech utopianism. Algorithmic art, with or without AI assistance, can be moving or tedious, fun or irritating, just like any other kind of creative endeavour. But when we assume we can produce originality via a conventional chord change or rhyming couplet, we may be just another cog in the culture industry&amp;rsquo;s endless grinding soulless reiteration of soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence won&amp;rsquo;t free us from this dynamic. But if we listen, it might speak back our own thoughts, or their absence, in words meaningless enough to make some new sense of a tired idea, from &amp;ldquo;be&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;eight&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A breakthrough in the hunt for chemical weapons</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Image credit: James Wainscoat" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/james-wainscoat-gthfMEtd7A8-unsplash-_1_.jpg" height="1279" alt="A stock image of thick vegetation" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On 22 April 1915, a cloud of noxious gas drifted from German lines towards the Allied troops entrenched on the Ypres battlefield. The soldiers were wholly unprepared, with no masks to protect them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not wanting to be caught offguard again, the Allies dispatched a chemist to the battlefield, to shed light on this devestating new weapon. Of course, by the time John Scott Haldane and his team arrived the gas had long since dispersed. But subtle clues were left. They noticed a discolouration of the brass buttons on the unfortunate soldiers&amp;rsquo; uniforms. Something had reacted with the zinc and copper in the brass, and the culprit was chlorine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over 100 years later, inspectors at sites of chemical weapon attacks face a similar problem. The chemical agents are reactive, volatile and frequently work at very low concentrations, all of which make them difficult to detect. Often autopsies are used, but this can be complicated as human remains need careful and considerate collection and transportation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plants, however, are much easier to work with. This approach has been recently pioneered by a group from TNO Defence in the Netherlands. They exposed plants to mustard gas, sarin (a nerve agent deployed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2013), chlorine and Novichok (used in the 2018 Salisbury attacks). Vegetation survives the exposure, but is not totally unaffected. Each of these agents reacts with proteins within the plants. These modified proteins can be easily extracted and detected using highly sensitive mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The method was tested on basil, stinging nettles and bay laurels, suggesting the approach will likely work for a wide variety of species. The only issue was that exposure to common household bleach generated the same response as chlorine gas. Meaning, in the absence of brass buttons, there is more work to be done to rule out this source of false positives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the methodology shows strong promise and now just requires some samples from real-world incidents to validate the approach. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope TNO Defence don&amp;rsquo;t get these samples any time soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Laughing at old ladies</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6123/laughing-at-old-ladies#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'An Old Woman', or 'The Ugly Duchess', by Quinten Massys. Copyright: The National Gallery" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Ugly-Duchess-cropped-resized.jpg" height="1008" alt="'An Old Woman' - commonly known as 'The Ugly Duchess' - by Quinten Massys. The portrait depicts an old woman with exaggerated features, including a bulging forehead and bosom squeezed into an ill-fitting corset" width="750"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is said that the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis died while laughing at his completed likeness of an ugly old woman. The Flemish artist Quinten Massys survived the painting of &amp;ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&amp;rdquo; (about 1513), but it might have been a close shave. Certainly plenty of people have at least smirked at her in the years since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is because, and there is no getting around it, she appears ridiculous: bulging forehead, protruding ears, puckered mouth, hairy mole on her cheek, huge horned headdress and shrivelled bosom. She looks beseechingly upwards, clutching a tiny withered rosebud. When the painting was put up for auction in 1920, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; advertised the sale of a &amp;ldquo;portrait which is generally accepted as being the ugliest one in the world&amp;rdquo;. But why is she ugly? And how are we meant to respond?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new exhibition at the National Gallery in London called &amp;ldquo;The Ugly Duchess: Beauty and Satire in the Renaissance&amp;rdquo; successfully answers these questions. It traces the influences on and atmosphere around the conception of &amp;ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; religious, artistic, misogynistic &amp;ndash; and convincingly places her within a long tradition of negative portrayals of women. There are witches, crones and hags; the incredible grotesques of Leonardo da Vinci; and the creepy John Tenniel illustrations for the 1865 edition of Lewis Carroll&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. All either influences on, or influenced by, Massys&amp;rsquo; duchess. It is to the considerable credit of this exhibition that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t dampened the fun of these artworks, while brilliantly elucidating the sinister threads that run through them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing that we discover is that the duchess has a partner. A man. Apparently, they were conceived as a pair, then separated and lost to each other for many years. Reunited, they make an odd couple. For one thing he looks remarkably unremarkable, even dull. He is seen in profile wearing a dark velvet cap and dark fur-trimmed coat. He looks prosperous and respectable. He has full lips, heavy lids and a bland expression, with one hand held up towards the duchess. Plainly, an exchange is taking place: his outstretched hand is a response to her proffered rosebud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exhibition makes clear that this was a familiar trope. The accompanying catalogue informs us that &amp;ldquo;The advent of print culture in the second half of the fifteenth century expanded the repertoire of secular imagery and propelled humorous subjects deriding what were then considered society&amp;rsquo;s ills.&amp;rdquo; One such target of satire was the so-called &amp;ldquo;ill-matched couple&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; usually a wrinkled woman or wizened man who is courted by a much younger partner desirous of their wealth. A brilliant example of this genre is provided in the form of an engraving by Israhel van Meckenem called &amp;ldquo;The Unequal Couple&amp;rdquo; (about 1480&amp;ndash;90). A corpse-like woman looks deep into the eyes of a beautiful young man with flowing locks, while his hand travels over the large bag of coins she is clutching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="&amp;quot;Alice and the Duchess&amp;quot; (1865) by John Tenniel. Copyright: V&amp;amp;A" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/FF8747.jpg" height="771" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our couple exhibit more dignified behaviour, yet they too would have been immediately identified as ridiculous. The man (possibly based on the vastly wealthy Cosimo de&amp;rsquo; Medici) is cast as a recognisably smug banker-merchant type, while the woman (rumoured to have been based on the famously ugly Margaret, Countess of Tyrol) is cast as a recognisably freakish grotesque &amp;ndash; a stock character borrowed from Leonardo da Vinci&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;visi mostruosi&lt;/em&gt; (monstrous faces). Her likeness appears again and again in different works by different artists &amp;ndash; in Florentine engravings, English misericords and French illustrations. In each she is a figure of either fear or fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One cause for ridicule is her outfit. The outsized headdress and revealing corset, in what was then an outdated and vulgar style, would have immediately marked her out as the &amp;ldquo;embodiment of foolish vanity&amp;rdquo;. The great philosopher Desiderius Erasmus (Massys&amp;rsquo; contemporary and patron) had especial contempt for such overdressed women: &amp;ldquo;Who would put up now with a decent married woman wearing those huge horns and pyramids and cones sticking out from the top of the head and having her brows and temples plucked so that nearly half her head is bald?&amp;rdquo; On seeing such a figure &amp;ldquo;Everyone would laugh and boo.&amp;rdquo; Clearly, in the 16th century, such a get-up was familiar visual comedy: the delusional old woman, full of lust and avarice, mutton dressed as lamb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But amid all the laughing and booing there is also a palpable unease. This is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the exhibition. Old women, their representation made more visceral by the period&amp;rsquo;s furtherance of verisimilitude, are here often depicted as sagging, cackling hags. Due to religious and folkloric superstitions and misunderstandings over how the female body works, there had developed a pervasive fear of women &amp;ndash; in particular, fear of their sexuality. &lt;em&gt;Malleus Maleficarum&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;The Hammer of Witches&lt;/em&gt;, first published in 1486), a treatise written by German Catholic clergyman Heinrich Kramer, declared that &amp;ldquo;all witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which is in women insatiable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This concern can be seen in Massys&amp;rsquo; sly-looking, overdressed hags (those horned headdresses are a sure sign of devil worship), but it finds its battiest representation in the wonderful engraving &amp;ldquo;Morris Dance with the Sausage Woman&amp;rdquo; by the Italian Monogrammist SE. Here, we behold a woman much like the duchess who holds in one hand a spear of phallic sausages and in the other a satanic cloven hoof, while a group of men dance around her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this image, and elsewhere, older women are depicted as worryingly powerful &amp;ndash; as enchantresses, seducers and subverters of men&amp;rsquo;s rightful position. The most exhilarating example featured in the exhibition is Albrecht D&amp;uuml;rer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat&amp;rdquo; (about 1500). An old, half-undressed woman with sagging breasts and an expression suggesting a full-throated war cry soars across the page on the back of a black, horned goat, scattering four cherubim in her wake. Her hair eerily flows in the opposite direction she is travelling and she suggestively grips the goat&amp;rsquo;s horn. In this disconcerting image of disorder and rebellion there is little for the male viewer to chuckle at.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In The Witch as Muse: Art, Gender and Power in Early Modern Europe&lt;/em&gt;, Linda Hults observes that &amp;ldquo;The sexual drive was believed to be greater in postmenopausal, widowed women. Their sexuality was especially repugnant not only because of their physical appearance but also because it could not lead to procreation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is interesting that Massys&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;ugliest&amp;rdquo; portrait should have an afterlife as the frightening duchess in &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; (beater of babies and owner of the Cheshire Cat). While not mentioned in the exhibition, the portrait also bears a resemblance to the witch in the Studio Ghibli film &lt;em&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/em&gt;. She becomes, in these new guises, divorced from the real-life fears and prejudices that shaped her in the first place. She is just a scary template. What is affecting about the items collected at the National Gallery is that they remind us of the uncomfortable themes beneath. In their laughter, sadness or fury, the paintings reflect something in the viewer. Perhaps a guilty conscience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exhibition holds out the promise of discovering a duchess who is not only grotesque, but also &amp;ldquo;subversive, fierce and defiant&amp;rdquo;. While the curators have gamely tried to reposition her as a more actively destabilising presence, this is ultimately unconvincing. Like it or not, the joke is entirely at her expense. &amp;ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&amp;rdquo; was conceived and executed amid titters, for an audience that was looking for a laugh. Although now, in this concise but wide-ranging exhibition, she might finally be in more sympathetic company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Travelling back in time with the Beatles</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6122/travelling-back-in-time-with-the-beatles#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/The_Beatles_performing_at_The_Ed_Sullivan_Show.jpg" height="641" alt="The Beatles performing on The Ed Sullivan Show" width="921"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my favourite scene from their animated film &lt;em&gt;Yellow Submarine&lt;/em&gt;, the cartoon Beatles see a submarine, identical to theirs, going in the opposite direction. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s someone in it. Look!&amp;rdquo; one remarks. &amp;ldquo;And they&amp;rsquo;re waving,&amp;rdquo; says another, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a group of fellas.&amp;rdquo; They wave back, realising that it&amp;rsquo;s themselves, going backwards in time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought often about how strange it must feel, being Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr, seeing their years as the Beatles &amp;ndash; one phase of their long lives &amp;ndash; take on a perpetual existence. And, quite unexpectedly, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself contributing to that spinning media whirl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In late March, I learned of the existence of an almost complete concert recording of the band made by a 15-year-old student at Stowe boarding school. A few days later, I broadcast the news on my BBC Radio programme Front Row. I had gone to Stowe with the former student, John Bloomfield, to make a special programme about the 60th anniversary of the concert. I had no idea about the tape until Bloomfield, now 75, revealed its existence to me. Listening to the concert transported me back to 4 April 1963, a particular moment in time when a group of privately educated boys saw the future in their encounter with a quartet of working-class boys from Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bloomfield had clearly decided now was the time to uncover the &amp;ldquo;lost tape&amp;rdquo;, and I was touched by his trust in me. I alerted Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn and arranged for us to listen to it in full together. Lewisohn told me the tape was genuinely important, for capturing the band in full, at a unique moment and before their gigs became entirely blanketed in screams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Certainly, when Bloomfield played some of the recorded songs from the original school theatre stage, through the modern speakers, I experienced something akin to a transformative moment: a realisation of how mind-blowing the juddering, bone-shaking intensity of their live performance must have been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As time transports us further away from the &amp;rsquo;60s and the Beatles, there is a sense of a growing reverence. Little snippets of film footage or old photographs emerge regularly like religious relics to be gawped at in the news and, as in medieval times, bought up by rich collectors for their private reliquaries. I had no intention of contributing to this trend. My story was really about the social history of that moment &amp;ndash; the unique collision of class and culture that took place during that concert, with its almost entirely male audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a massive mythology that has built up around such moments in the Beatles&amp;rsquo; career, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lovely secular power in the fact that the gig has been captured on tape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have the vision of a sixth-former to thank, who had seen the band perform in the Cavern nightclub and approached the manager. This bold student, Dave Moores (who would go on to become the chairman of Liverpool FC), organised the concert himself, selling tickets at 5 shillings to cover the &amp;pound;100 fee, without involving any schoolmasters. Bloomfield was stage manager and decided to run a tape with a microphone at the front of the stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no denying the intense religious devotion that the band evoke in some fans. Within hours of breaking the story I had messages from several countries, some polite, but most with an edge of urgency, desperately keen to know what was on the set list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One astute reader queried anxiously about whether a photograph of the band at Stowe that night, used to illustrate a newspaper story about my find, had been flipped or mirrored &amp;ndash; they were concerned that Paul and Ringo were holding pens in their wrong hands (Paul and Ringo are left-handed, although Ringo might have signed with his right).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New threads to the story have emerged since then, through the people contacting me. One of the very few girls at the gig, a daughter of the couple who ran the tuck shop, got in touch on hearing my report. I connected her to Bloomfield, a boy she&amp;rsquo;d not spoken to for 60 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Yellow Submarine&lt;/em&gt;, the old sea captain warns the band, &amp;ldquo;If we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we&amp;rsquo;ll all disappear up our own existence.&amp;rdquo; But there is nothing introspective about this story. I was delighted to hear that Bloomfield plans to donate the tape to a public cultural institution. Far from adding to a private reliquary, it looks like the Stowe tape will continue to open up joyful stories for the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
