    <title>Just Asking Questions</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/10/18/just-asking-questions-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/stevesviggum.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/stevesviggum-150x148.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="148" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-68211" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/stevesviggum-150x148.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/stevesviggum-300x296.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/stevesviggum-500x494.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/stevesviggum.jpeg 582w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="lead"&gt;The regent, Steve Sviggum, who who wondered if &lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/10/17/morris-is-too-diverse-according-to-a-republican-regent/"&gt;Morris was &lt;q&gt;too diverse to attend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is feeling a little bit of heat, I guess. He called in to a Minneapolis radio show &lt;a href="https://www.audacy.com/wccoradio/news/local/sviggum-doubles-down-on-controversial-question"&gt;to defend himself (or double-down on his comments, more accurately)&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;#8217;s a sampling of quotes from the radio show. See if you can find a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t see asking a question is being offensive or wrong, it certainly, certainly not racist,&lt;/q&gt; Sviggum told Vineeta Sawkar on the WCCO Morning News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t understand how asking a comment or question to someone makes them defensive.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I just simply asked the question. We should not be above asking questions.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I was just asking a question. I&amp;#8217;m sorry some found it offensive.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you such an insensitive, bigoted lout, Steve Sviggum? I don&amp;#8217;t understand how that would make you defensive, and I&amp;#8217;m sorry if you find it offensive. He constantly states that he&amp;#8217;s just stating facts, but he isn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the facts: enrollment at the University of Minnesota Morris is down significantly, by about 40%. A larger proportion of our students are students of color right now. That&amp;#8217;s a fact. It&amp;#8217;s a problem that enrollments are down, but it is a strength that our student body is diverse. Sviggum wants to address the problem by attacking our strength, because he&amp;#8217;s a racist idiot. &lt;a href="https://www.rawstory.com/university-of-minnesota-regent-asks-if-morris-campus-is-becoming-too-diverse/"&gt;The numbers are worrisome&lt;/a&gt;, I would agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like colleges and universities across the country, the University of Minnesota-Morris has been grappling with declining enrollments for the past decade. Of the University of Minnesota’s five campuses, enrollment has declined the greatest at Morris, which has seen a 45% drop in the number of students attending from 10 years ago. In the 2011 academic year, Morris had 1,932 students compared to 1,068 today.&lt;br /&gt;
…&lt;br /&gt;
The greatest enrollment decline has been among white students. Nearly 70% of the student body was white a decade ago compared to 54% of the student body in the current academic year. The share of Native students has increased significantly from 13% a decade ago to 31% today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that white students are still the majority; also be aware that the demographics tell us that white America is approaching a majority-minority condition, and that&amp;#8217;s going to become the norm everywhere. It&amp;#8217;s nothing to fear. When we had a major educational grant from HHMI, that was one of the points they drilled into us, that we needed to address those changing demographics and be welcoming to diverse students if we wanted to retain a strong science community in this country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to address our declining enrollments, you have to look at the factual causes. We&amp;#8217;re in a pandemic, which has hit colleges hard. We&amp;#8217;re remote from major population centers, which made it rough for students; I have had so many students who have asked for excused absences because they had to go home to help their families, or attend funerals, or deal with their own quarantine. We lost a huge chunk of international students, thanks to the political situation and the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/10/17/u-regent-sviggum-wonders-if-morris-campus-is-too-diverse"&gt;dropping from 11% of our student body to 2%&lt;/a&gt;. You won&amp;#8217;t see many Chinese students on campus anymore. That is not a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sviggum&amp;#8217;s comments have become national news. Most of what I&amp;#8217;ve seen has been supportive of UMM, such as these words from John Hodgman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Years ago I did a show at the Morris Campus of U of M in February. I have never driven further thru a colder, bleaker landscape to find one of the warmest and smartest audiences I’ve ever encountered. These students are heroes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/MbEhLiIYYC"&gt;https://t.co/MbEhLiIYYC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; John Hodgman (@hodgman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hodgman/status/1582374738210344961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on back, John, that was a great show. Unfortunately, instead what we&amp;#8217;re getting is a visit from Sviggum, who will no doubt try to defend himself by saying he was just JAQing off. I don&amp;#8217;t think he&amp;#8217;ll get a friendly reception, except maybe by the College Republicans, who will demonstrate by their ugly existence that maybe we are a little bit too diverse in one way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our acting chancellor, Janet Schrunk Ericksen, has made a public comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, October 13, I gave a presentation to the Board of Regents about our enrollment and how it relates to the U of M System strategic plan, MPact 2025. The question and answer part of the presentation included conversation regarding the diversity of our campus and has resulted in media attention. I want to reiterate that our strength is in our diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Minnesota Morris is a student-centered public university.Our students are curious, hungry to learn, and open-minded. They come from rural communities, Tribal nations, metropolitan centers, and cities abroad. Indeed, multiple perspectives and experiences of people who have different backgrounds are absolutely core to education and particularly liberal arts education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our campus strategic vision and plan includes our commitment to enhance the liberal arts education opportunity for students from all backgrounds, especially those from diverse, first-generation, and low-income populations. I am proud of the Morris campus community and its inclusive voices, and I will continue to support our efforts to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion as integral parts of our liberal arts mission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll just add that maybe one of the reasons we are at all successful in the current adverse conditions is that UMM is actually an excellent place for academic and demographic diversity, and we&amp;#8217;re not going to change that, despite Sviggum&amp;#8217;s pointed comments in that radio show about how maybe Minnesota needs to shut down a few universities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pull of our ancient ancestors</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6030/the-pull-of-our-ancient-ancestors#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="The Nine Ladies stone circle, Stanton Moor " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Nine_Ladies_stone_circle,_Stanton_Moor_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2360408.jpg" height="631" alt="The Nine Ladies of Stanton Moor" width="946" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Stanton Moor is situated in Derbyshire&amp;rsquo;s beautiful Peak District National Park, in the heart of England. At first glance up here, it&amp;rsquo;s all foxgloves, purple heather and wildflowers. But if you have an archaeologist&amp;rsquo;s eye, like my friend Ian Jackson, you can detect something more deliberately patterned in the rocky formations that stretch out to the horizon in every direction: the outline of a Bronze Age roundhouse, sunken into the rock-strewn moor. The walls are long fallen and weathered away. Ian pointed out the narrow path that leads downwards and suddenly I saw it too. I stepped into the entrance and back through time. I was in someone&amp;rsquo;s home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re closer to the Bronze Age people than they were to those who built Stonehenge,&amp;rdquo; Ian observed. For a moment I was struck silent with the majesty of that timescale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;I had come Bronze Age hunting because, like many people it seems, I have recently become fascinated with the pre-Roman peoples of the British Isle. My walk was partly prompted by the British Museum&amp;rsquo;s blockbuster early summer exhibition on Stonehenge, the Neolithic stone circle in Wiltshire. Such stone circles pepper the length and breadth of this island nation. Not far from Stanton Moor is Arbor Low, another Neolithic stone circle at which the stones are now flat on the ground. Historians believe they were deliberately knocked down by medieval people, fuelled by their own superstitions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Stonehenge is a monument that Brits tend to think of as archetypically British. But the exhibition confounded all expectations. A wall mounted with dozens of beautiful stone axe heads from all over Europe revealed, post-Brexit, an almost provocatively counterintuitive picture; Britain connected by a large land bridge to northern Europe, with Stonehenge as the trading and pilgrimage heart of a borderless world. Recent excavations have provided plentiful evidence of trade from further afield &amp;ndash; pottery, jewellery and weapons from the Middle East, North Africa and Asia Minor. More intriguing still were the mysterious carvings of flowing spirals and cups and rings, on giant rocks and boulders found across Europe, from Germany to Scotland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The British Museum show was fascinating &amp;ndash; but there were some troubling aspects too. The exhibition included skeletons that had been unearthed in graves. One was the skeleton of a woman who was still clutching the outline of her dead baby, a bag of more than a hundred animal teeth buried with them as a spiritual offering. After more than a century of challenge, museums would not, I think, dare to display the human remains of ancient First Nation peoples this way. On the one hand, modern Europeans claim a kinship with these ancient brothers and sisters, and yet we tolerate what could be seen as the desecration of their graves. With their belief systems long lost, they have no one to advocate for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;And yet there is an honest spiritual craving in our modern behaviour around ancient monuments. Stonehenge is now understood to have been built in line with the natural cycle of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation around the Sun, aligning with sunrise during the solstices. Humanists surely recognise the pull of acknowledging our place in the beautiful but indifferent Solar System.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Iwitnessed this pull in action on that day before the summer solstice when Ian and I walked on Stanton Moor. Not far from where Ian pointed out the outline of ancient homes is a Bronze Age stone circle known as the Nine Ladies. Around it, a tent city had grown up, of young families as much as old hippies, wanting to be part of something bigger than themselves. Such gatherings have been happening all over the country at stone circles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Part of it, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, is that after all the Covid lockdowns, we are still cherishing our right to roam freely and be with others. But there seems to be something else we are craving. It may seem that we know very little about our ancient ancestors. We don&amp;rsquo;t have a good idea of how they looked, and even their bones have mostly vanished. But they have left the most tantalising glimpses: jewellery made of black obsidian; gold torques of such weight and braided beauty it&amp;rsquo;s dazzling to imagine them worn in ritual acts. It&amp;rsquo;s also pleasing to discover that some of the finds in the Stonehenge exhibition suggest women may well have held positions of power in these societies, as shamans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;These were humans living on a minute timescale compared to the weathered rocks of their monuments. Yet their mystery binds them to us. We are drawn to the idea of their transience &amp;ndash; for what did the pandemic do more to reveal than the fragility of our own lives?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Work Pray Code</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6029/book-review-work-pray-code#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Buddhist monks at Facebook&amp;rsquo;s headquarters" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/buddhafacebook.jpeg" height="1010" alt="Buddhist monks at Facebook" width="1596" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Pray Code (Princeton University Press) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;by Carolyn Chen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;What happens to us, and what happens to religion, when people worship work?&amp;rdquo; This is the question that occupies sociologist Carolyn Chen in &lt;em&gt;Work Pray Code&lt;/em&gt;, her new book based on in-depth research on Silicon Valley&amp;rsquo;s tech industry. Her answer reveals the book&amp;rsquo;s title (with its suggestion of bounded activities) to be a slight misnomer. For, as Chen discovers, work is not only &amp;ldquo;replacing religion&amp;rdquo; (increasingly omnipresent in employees&amp;rsquo; lives, and the object of faith and devotion); it is infused with spiritual and religious practices geared, ultimately, towards maximum productivity. This is a world where work is not so much distinct from prayer as blurred with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Chen suggests that Silicon Valley &amp;ndash; ostensibly one of America&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;least religious&amp;rdquo; places &amp;ndash; is not so &amp;ldquo;godless&amp;rdquo; after all. The tech workplace is &amp;ldquo;conscripting&amp;rdquo; religion; borrowing (typically, but not exclusively) from Asian spiritual and religious traditions, such as yoga and meditation, to help employees to become &amp;ldquo;whole&amp;rdquo; and connect to their &amp;ldquo;authentic selves&amp;rdquo;. But the nurturing care and cultivation of employees&amp;rsquo; spiritual lives are not altruistic. Rather, they rest upon the logic that the &amp;ldquo;self-alienated&amp;rdquo; worker operates at sub-optimal capacity. They are also vulnerable to burnout, which is blamed not on overwork, but &amp;ldquo;insufficient self-care&amp;rdquo;. No wonder, then, that employees might seek &amp;ldquo;optimisation&amp;rdquo; through practices including meditation, journaling and even fasting. Chen quotes one CEO who asks his staff to anonymously rate, weekly, aspects of their lives including spirituality. &amp;ldquo;Everyone knows&amp;rdquo;, he explains, &amp;ldquo;that if you&amp;rsquo;re not taking care of yourself, you&amp;rsquo;re not playing for the team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Chen describes the &amp;ldquo;meditation entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; including mindfulness teachers, HR executives and the coaches allocated to high-potential staff &amp;ndash; who share the challenge of selling &amp;ldquo;a religious product in a professedly secular workplace&amp;rdquo;. In doing so, they renounce a &amp;ldquo;sacred, separate, Asian, otherworldly, and ethical religious Buddhism&amp;rdquo;, and replace it with one that is &amp;ldquo;universalised, Whitened, scientised, profitable, and efficient&amp;rdquo;. Meditation thus becomes a snackable &amp;ldquo;skill&amp;rdquo; used to aid creativity, flow and focus (alongside empathy, with a view to enabling more &amp;ldquo;user friendly&amp;rdquo; design). Indeed, the practices Chen describes seem so far from actual Buddhism that one wonders whether they can be analysed in terms of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; at all. Chen explains: &amp;ldquo;tech meditators&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo;, but use &amp;ldquo;religious traditions &amp;ndash; their practices, rituals, and teachings &amp;ndash; as tools or technologies to optimise their work performance&amp;rdquo;, directed towards the &amp;ldquo;religion of work&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Though wonderfully rich in detail, &lt;em&gt;Work Pray Code&lt;/em&gt; is frustrated by its failure to provide, early on, a firm working definition of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo;. This is clarified in an appendix, where Chen suggests that religion &amp;ldquo;in a secular age&amp;rdquo; can be studied not only through &amp;ldquo;religious things&amp;rdquo;, but those things that are also &amp;ldquo;sacred&amp;rdquo; to us and command worship (e.g. work, worshipped through yoga). Still, it leads one to wonder where &amp;ldquo;spirituality&amp;rdquo; ends and &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and, indeed, cultishness &amp;ndash; begins. Some readers may find Chen&amp;rsquo;s conclusion conservative: though critical of the extent to which work is worshipped, Chen does not challenge work itself; likewise, she criticises &amp;ldquo;religions&amp;rdquo; for not confronting work worship, but leaves religion per se untouched. She suggests, &amp;ldquo;Religious traditions can offer a powerful and distinct set of ethics, communities, and rituals to counter the morally bereft religion of work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Still, Chen&amp;rsquo;s critique of Silicon Valley&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Techtopia&amp;rdquo; and its impact on the wider social fabric is powerful. She describes how participatory democracy &amp;ndash; indeed, the common good &amp;ndash; suffers when we worship work and disengage from civic life; how public goods become private &amp;ldquo;perks&amp;rdquo; when the tech industry dominates; how so-called &amp;ldquo;wholeness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the basic stuff of a good life&amp;rdquo; has become the &amp;ldquo;privilege&amp;rdquo; of the highly skilled, while others lack even basic security. Silicon Valley is, she suggests, a bellwether. One need not agree with Chen&amp;rsquo;s framework of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; to see that we must pay attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;WHAT THE FUCK? It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe that a regent of the University of Minnesota asked this &lt;em&gt;fucking stupid question&lt;/em&gt;, but then you notice that it&amp;#8217;s a former speaker of the Minnesota house of representatives, a Republican, and it becomes a little less surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Sviggum asks if my university has become &lt;q&gt;too diverse&lt;/q&gt;, from a &lt;q&gt;marketing standpoint&lt;/q&gt;. Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This clip doesn’t even need a caption. “Has UMN Morris become too diverse for a student to attend?” How is this an actual question being asked during a Board of Regents meeting??? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BSU_UMN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BSU_UMN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USGumn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@USGumn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mndailynews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mndailynews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarTribune?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@StarTribune&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ilhan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Ilhan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kare11?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@kare11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphaNewsMN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AlphaNewsMN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KSTP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@KSTP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FOX9?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FOX9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RWPUSA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RWPUSA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UMNProud?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#UMNProud&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Tiz5ZCdLuS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Tiz5ZCdLuS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Watch Dog UMN (@WatchDogUMN) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WatchDogUMN/status/1580795740938702849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His concern, or rather his excuse for his concern, is that two people, two bigots, wrote to him to say that the diversity on the University of Minnesota Morris campus made them uncomfortable and they wouldn&amp;#8217;t send their kids here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously. This is one of the people who controls the pursestrings of my university. He got two letters that he should have instantly shredded, and instead he decided to confront our chancellor with the fact that the Republican bigots of Minnesota have his ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Chancellor Ericksen responded calmly and appropriately to such an outrageous assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;41% of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UMNMorris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@UMNMorris&lt;/a&gt; is categorized as BIPOC students. Too high of a number for Regent Sviggum, it appears as though he’d rather closely mirror the surrounding area of Morris (86.8% white) or Minnesota at large (83% white). Chancellor Ericksen navigates this question with class: &lt;a href="https://t.co/CeJgo6jMh2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CeJgo6jMh2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Watch Dog UMN (@WatchDogUMN) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WatchDogUMN/status/1580795900342853632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a good thing she has the job, and not me (not that there&amp;#8217;s ever a chance I&amp;#8217;d end up in such a position), because I&amp;#8217;d have just yelled, &amp;#8220;Fuck you, asshole&amp;#8221; and scrabbled for something on the desk I could throw at Sviggum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Pennsylvania politics is taking a twisty and unsavory turn. It seems &lt;a href="https://crooksandliars.com/2022/10/are-you-kidding-me-dr-oz-shocked-other"&gt;Oz has a long fascination with drinking urine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dr. Oz said “of course” he has tasted his own urine, claims medical school forces doctors to taste it, and said his curiosity for it started when he was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oz: “Aren’t you curious about your urine?” &lt;a href="https://t.co/2SgMCSe7JQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2SgMCSe7JQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; PatriotTakes &lt;img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt; (@patriottakes) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patriottakes/status/1581289789101264897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, it&amp;#8217;s odd and rather woo-wooish (but then we knew he was a quack), but what&amp;#8217;s particularly annoying is the lying. Med schools don&amp;#8217;t expect you to taste urine. It&amp;#8217;s not part of modern medical diagnostics. Historically, it was a test to diagnose diabetes, but Oz is not a centuries-old doctor who might have done such a thing. I like &lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pervertjustice/2022/10/16/dr-oz-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-glass-of-piss/"&gt;CD&amp;#8217;s take&lt;/a&gt;: it&amp;#8217;s a kink that isn&amp;#8217;t going to endear you to the voters, but if you&amp;#8217;re doing it at home, it&amp;#8217;s not something that would disqualify you for office. If you&amp;#8217;re trying to promote it as a tool for better health, though, you&amp;#8217;re wrong and you&amp;#8217;re a quack.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Time for a new renaissance?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6034/time-for-a-new-renaissance#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;img title="HowTheLightGetsIn festival aims to bring disciplines together, particularly philosophers and scientists" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/highres_84_6896-1-_1_.jpg" height="1278" alt="HowTheLightGetsIn London" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;You know the feeling. You pass the window of a book store, or switch on a political talk show, and are overwhelmed by an irritating sensation of deja vu. Haven&amp;rsquo;t you heard these ideas before? Behind the shiny new designs, aren&amp;rsquo;t these latest non-fiction hardbacks peddling the same basic theories, tweaked to entice a fresh audience? It can be difficult to gauge how our own personal frustration relates to the broader reality. On Sunday, HowTheLightGetsIn London confronted this perception head on. HTLGI is a festival dedicated to "big ideas", bringing together academics, scientists, creatives and "thought leaders" of all stripes. They have more than a vested interest, therefore, in answering the question. Is our intellectual climate in Britain stagnating? If so, how do we encourage new and original thinking?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The event brought together speakers from the diverse fields of philosophy, theoretical physics and journalism to chew over the dilemma. While the term &amp;ldquo;Renaissance Man&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t pass the lips of any of the speakers (although they might have updated it to &amp;ldquo;Renaissance person&amp;rdquo;), the figure of the free-thinking polymath was a definite spectre in the room. John Ellis, the renowned theoretical particle physicist, called for a more meaningful exchange of ideas and collaboration between disciplines. He pointed out that the experimental techniques he uses to test his ideas within the field of fundamental physics could fruitfully be applied to climate science. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible, he said, to get small pots of money for this kind of work, securing funding for such projects in the longer term is disappointingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;"Interdisciplinarity" is a term that is readily bandied about these days, but as the philosopher Sophie Scott-Brown remarked, we "need to pay more attention to what it actually means." She said this could be anything from bringing academics from different departments together to &amp;ldquo;sit around the same table&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;melting down the barriers&amp;rdquo; between disciplines. She is strongly in favour of the latter, envisioning a transformative shift towards a more creative, &amp;ldquo;inquiry-led&amp;rdquo; approach. Taking up John Ellis&amp;rsquo; point, dynamic and complex problems like the climate crisis, or the future of global security, could be tackled with the inventiveness required through putting more emphasis on bringing people together on the basis of what knowledge and skills they might bring to the challenge, whatever their field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But this isn't only a question of transforming our approach to learning and research. The trend towards specialisation is tightly linked today with the pressure on universities to adopt business practices and become increasingly self-sufficient, in the light of severe government cuts. The incentive to meet targets, the pressure to secure funding, and the fierce competition for students all serve to create an environment in which, in Scott-Brown's words, ideas are pumped out as "products". Meanwhile, the kind of open-ended inquiry that so often produces new discoveries is hampered by the need to justify the research in advance. &amp;ldquo;Most of my colleagues have to be 99 per cent sure about what they&amp;rsquo;re writing before putting forward a funding application.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;It's interesting that the most concrete idea came from the non-academic on the panel. The journalist David Aaronovitch made an impassioned plea to &amp;ldquo;abolish the A-level&amp;rdquo;, arguing that this would change the culture of learning that runs from school into universities. He claimed that every single British government had done a report on the A-level and found it to be wanting, but that there was a stubborn belief that specialisation is what makes the English system exceptional. He advocated switching to the International Baccalaureate (IB). The United States has the largest number of IB programmes, in both private and state schools, and he suggested that we take some lessons from the American approach, where university degrees are also four years, instead of three, and place more emphasis on students studying a wider breadth of subjects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Aaronovitch disagreed that our society is suffering from a lack of new big ideas, however. Following the two "isms" of the 20th century (communism and fascism), we now have a distrust of them which is perfectly healthy, he argued. We can see this plainly from the much more recent example of Prime Minister Truss&amp;rsquo; mini-budget, which is deeply &amp;ldquo;ideological&amp;rdquo; and has been a "failure". With big questions like how do we get to net zero, he said, "I'm happy to be more pragmatic."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Whether in pursuit of bold new theories, or working on practical solutions, there is hope when it comes to bringing people together. John Ellis praised the inclusion of more women and people of colour in the research community, and the way in which technology was creating a more level playing field when it came to participating in scientific debate. &amp;ldquo;And here I am,&amp;rdquo; he joked, &amp;ldquo;in a philosophy debate, while two other debates are going on about my own field of science.&amp;rdquo; HowTheLightGetsIn is one of the spaces where philosophers and scientists in particular benefit from coming together. &amp;ldquo;This is us forming the new society,&amp;rdquo; Scott-Brown said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But the festival happens twice a year, a drop in the ocean. For the spirit of a New Renaissance to take hold, changes would be needed on many levels: cultural, political and economic. It's certain that we need creativity and invention in order to meet the confluence of crises facing Britain today. While our current Prime Minister may indeed have outlined a consistent ideological position, her ideas are explicitly rooted in Thatcherism. It seems likely that a failure to generate new big ideas appropriate to the particular challenges Britain faces today will only lead to a dangerous re-hashing of the old. We know that our intellectual climate is fed by many sources, but the health of the academy, along with our education system as a whole, is surely the bedrock of the edifice. Interdisciplinarity will be key to renewal, but any transformation will need to start by treating universities not as businesses within the higher education market, but as spaces of learning, sharing and discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More details on HowTheLightGetsIn, the world's largest ideas and music festival, can be found &lt;a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/london"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those of you who couldn't be with us in person, all the debates and talks from the festival will gradually be released online in the coming months on the Institute of Art and Ideas online platform, &lt;a href="https://iai.tv/?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;amp;utm_campaign=London2022&amp;amp;utm_id=Partner"&gt;IAI.TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Originally published in Denmark in 1981, a small run of editions appeared in English translation two years later. It sought to present an affirming image of a child being raised by same-sex parents, featuring black and white photographs of Jenny (played by the author&amp;rsquo;s daughter) and her two dads happily going about their daily lives together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Produced with the best of intentions, &lt;em&gt;Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin&lt;/em&gt; disastrously failed to take account of cultural differences between England and Denmark, notably by including a picture of the family eating breakfast in bed where Eric and Martin are shirtless. Despite the fact that few had apparently seen, let alone read, a copy, the book and similar literature provoked a moral panic in this country, antagonising a range of ghoulish moral entrepreneurs and far-right journalists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;At the same time, Labour-led local authorities in some areas of London were attempting to introduce what would now be referred to as LGBT-inclusive education in schools, which brought them into fierce conflict with Margaret Thatcher&amp;rsquo;s government. In the shadow of the Aids crisis, the legislation which became known as Clause 28, and later Section 28, was passed into law in May 1988. Its supporters believed that they were protecting children from harm. Section 28 demanded that local authorities should not &amp;ldquo;intentionally promote homosexuality or promote the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.&amp;rdquo; It reached far beyond school classrooms, emboldening homophobic discrimination as well as fostering censorship and self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Paul Baker&amp;rsquo;s popular history, &lt;em&gt;Outrageous: The Story of Section 28 and Britain&amp;rsquo;s Battle for LGBT Education&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides a lucid and at times highly personal account of the rise and fall of Section 28, set against a backdrop of the turbulent moral and political conflicts of late 20th-century Britain. The book is at its best when narrating the popular resistance mobilised by the embattled LGBT community, ranging from mass public protests to pieces of audacious direct action. Oral history is used to relate two of the best known of these episodes, which &amp;ldquo;invaded&amp;rdquo; spaces at the heart of the establishment. In February 1988, members of &amp;ldquo;Lesbians against the Clause&amp;rdquo; evaded security and abseiled from the visitors&amp;rsquo; balcony in the House of Lords, disrupting the debate. The protestors (who in a nice touch, supplied the names of famous lesbians in history instead of their own) were arrested. The following month, another group of lesbian activists, frustrated at the way the media was covering stories about Clause 28, launched an incursion into a television studio, disrupting a live broadcast of the &lt;em&gt;Six O&amp;rsquo;Clock News&lt;/em&gt;. The ensuing scuffle generated the memorable headline &amp;ldquo;Beeb man sits on lesbian&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The latter part of the book covers the rocky road to the repeal of Section 28 in the early years of the 2000s; the fruit of sustained lobbying of LGBT advocacy organisations and activists. The delay in repeal &amp;ndash; six years from the election of Labour in 1997 &amp;ndash; demonstrates the difficulty in removing Section 28 in the face of resistant public opinion. There is brief coverage of the separate battle for repeal in Scotland in which a wealthy evangelical Christian businessman bankrolled a &amp;ldquo;referendum&amp;rdquo;. Accompanied by a spike in homophobic hate crime, it was claimed to show that a majority favoured keeping the legislation. However, mainstream politicians and the Electoral Reform Society cast doubt on the poll, and the associated &amp;ldquo;Keep the Clause&amp;rdquo; campaign was ultimately unsuccessful. This moment in Scottish history deserves its own in-depth account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;If there is a weakness to this book it is perhaps the failure to fully interrogate socially conservative ideology. Firstly, there might have been more consideration of the religious context of Section 28: the secularisation of English society since the 1960s, the declining power of Christian ideas about sexualities and the attempted counter-revolution by Christian moral conservatives in the 1980s. Notably, the pushback in this country failed to generate a religious revival similar to that witnessed in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Secondly, there is the murky issue of why vocal advocates of Section 28 in the 1980s seemed to genuinely believe that homosexuality was somehow to be equated with child abuse. Baker speculates that perhaps some of the members of the House of Lords who contributed to the debates had been &amp;ldquo;involved in coercive sexual experiences at boarding school which left them traumatised and confused&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but this theory only hints at one possible contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outrageous&lt;/em&gt; will not be the final word on the moral battles over sexual politics and regulation in late 20th-century Britain. It can be assumed that there was simply so much potential source material for this contemporary cultural history that plenty had to remain unsaid. What does make the cut is well chosen, and Baker&amp;rsquo;s writing style is capable of enlivening even the stodge of parliamentary debate. He has given us a witty, accessible and necessary book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The future of spycraft</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6027/the-future-of-spycraft#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Interpreting a reconnaissance photo during the Cuban missile crisis, 1962" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/D990MF.jpg" height="773" alt="Interpreting a reconnaissance photo during the Cuban missile crisis" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In January 2022, US President Joe Biden declassified an extraordinary trove of intelligence to warn that Russia was about to invade Ukraine. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn&amp;rsquo;t believe him. Zelensky complained to reporters that the US was hyping the threat and hurting his economy. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the president of Ukraine, I&amp;rsquo;m based here and I think I know the details deeper than any other president,&amp;rdquo; he said. Within a month, 100,000 Russian troops attacked on three fronts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Zelensky has since become a heroic figure of courage and leadership. But he&amp;rsquo;s also human &amp;ndash; and his inability to see the invasion coming offers a powerful reminder of the challenges of intelligence analysis. Everyone knows, but we often forget, that predicting the future is hard. Experts loaded with data are often wrong. Doctors offer incorrect diagnoses and investors back the wrong companies. Intelligence is even harder, because data is scarce and adversaries are working hard to deceive. In foreign policy, the world out there is difficult to anticipate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s only part of the story. The other part &amp;ndash; which often gets overlooked &amp;ndash; is us: human brains are not wired to assess the future well. Psychology research finds that people rely on mental shortcuts to process the information bombarding them each day. These shortcuts are called cognitive biases. They enable faster thinking and efficient decision-making, like skimming Yelp reviews to pick a restaurant and voting on party-line tickets rather than carefully assessing each candidate for every local position. But cognitive biases are also prone to error, tricking our brains into thinking likely events are unlikely and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Certain biases have played an outsized role in intelligence, from China&amp;rsquo;s entry into the Korean War, and the Cuban missile crisis, to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq and Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s unwillingness to believe Russia would invade. Events seem like surprises, even when they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Optimism bias and probabilities&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The most likely explanation for Zelensky&amp;rsquo;s dismissal of US intelligence warnings was that he didn&amp;rsquo;t want them to be true. He suffered from optimism bias, or a tendency to view information through the lens of wishful thinking. He&amp;rsquo;s got plenty of company. Optimism bias is everywhere. Researchers have found that people believe good events will happen to themselves more than others, that their own investments will outperform the average, that their favourite sports team has a higher chance of winning than it actually does. Optimism distorts the assessment of information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Politicians can be highly susceptible to proposals claiming favourable estimates of success, whether it&amp;rsquo;s humanitarian intervention in Somalia, war in Libya or renewed sanctions against Iran. The leaders of nearly every country involved in the First World War predicted a swift victory. &amp;ldquo;Give me 700,000 men and I will conquer Europe,&amp;rdquo; said General No&amp;euml;l de Castelnau, chief of staff for the French army at the outbreak of the war. Castelnau got 8.4 million men &amp;ndash; more than ten times the number he said he needed &amp;ndash; but Europe wasn&amp;rsquo;t conquered. It was decimated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Humans are not objective, no matter how hard we try to be. Researchers have found that people are wedded to their initial beliefs and will cling to them even in the face of contrary evidence. In Roman times, the imperial physician Galen was so confident in his remedies that no evidence could prove him wrong. He wrote, &amp;ldquo;All who drink of this treatment recover in a short time, except those whom it does not help, who all die. It is obvious, therefore, that it fails only in incurable cases.&amp;rdquo; Francis Bacon warned of the dangers of confirmation bias in 1620, writing, &amp;ldquo;The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion . . . draws all things else to support and agree with it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;We are also terrible with probabilities. Ever wonder why people are more afraid of dying in a shark attack than a car crash, even though fatal car accidents are about 60,000 times more likely? It&amp;rsquo;s not because people are stupid. The problem is availability bias: people naturally assume something they can easily recall is more likely to occur. Vivid, horrifying events (like shark attacks in the news) are generally easier to remember than everyday occurrences (like car accidents) even though they&amp;rsquo;re statistically less likely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;And intelligence analysts are human, like everyone else. We can see the powerful grip of recent experience in how different intelligence analysts viewed information about whether &amp;ldquo;the Pacer&amp;rdquo; walking around a suspicious Pakistani compound in 2011 was Osama bin Laden. Estimates about whether they had found the al-Qaeda leader ranged from 40 to 95 per cent. Those who had lived through the intelligence failure of overestimating Saddam&amp;rsquo;s WMD programs were more sceptical of the intelligence and issued lower probability estimates that the Pacer was bin Laden, while those coming off recent counterterrorism successes issued more optimistic assessments. What you predict depends on what you&amp;rsquo;ve experienced. It was only after US Navy Seals raided the compound that the evidence was in: they had found bin Laden after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p5"&gt;Thinking like the enemy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Good intelligence analysis also involves understanding how others think. Here, too, psychology research reveals why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to get inside the minds of others. One of the most challenging problems is called the fundamental attribution error, which is the tendency to believe that others behave badly because of their personality, while we behave badly because of factors beyond our control. Or put more simply, people often jump to blaming others while letting themselves off the hook. Drivers think that someone cutting them off must be a jerk, rather than wondering if there&amp;rsquo;s an emergency requiring them to drive that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In foreign policy crises, one country often overestimates the hostile motives of another, or underestimates how threatening its own actions could appear, or both. In the First Gulf War and the Iraq War, both the US and Iraq largely misunderstood the other&amp;rsquo;s view. Iraq underestimated the United States&amp;rsquo; risk tolerance following the Cold War and 9/11, and the US failed to see that Saddam was much more concerned about the Iranian threat than the American one. In both 1990 and 2003, an incomplete picture of the other side&amp;rsquo;s intentions and motives led to costly conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Trying to think like your adversary can backfire too, thanks to a process called mirror-imaging, which is the tendency to estimate how someone else will behave by projecting what you would do in the same situation. Framing your assessment with &amp;ldquo;If I were Xi Jinping,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;If I were a Russian intelligence officer&amp;rdquo; is one the greatest pitfalls in intelligence analysis and foreign policy decision making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The Cuban missile crisis of 1962 saw one of the most dangerous instances of mutual mirror-imaging, leading the world to the nuclear brink. American analysts failed to weigh the costs and benefits of a nuclear missile deployment to Cuba through Soviet eyes. And the Soviets appeared to make the same mistake when estimating how the US would react to its secret gambit. Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called the Cuban missile crisis &amp;ldquo;the most dangerous moment in human history&amp;rdquo;. Why? Because each side believed the other thought like they did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Improving analysis to prevent nuclear catastrophe isn&amp;rsquo;t just a matter of history. Great power competition is back. Russia and China are trying to rewrite the international order along authoritarian lines. Their nuclear arsenals are expanding and modernising at alarming rates. And war is raging once again in the heart of Europe. Today, Nato is grappling with how it can help Ukraine defeat Russia without provoking World War III. The stakes are high, the policy challenges are complex, and intelligence analysis is pivotal to success. What have we learned about how humans think and how we can do better?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;After the Iraq WMD intelligence failure, the US Intelligence Community (IC) launched several initiatives to improve analysis. One was commissioning a study by academics from different fields to examine ideas in the social sciences and recommend ways for the IC to adopt them. I was one of the experts on the study, and I jumped at the chance. One of our recommendations was that the Intelligence Community needed to test its analytic methods in a rigorous way to see whether, how and why some approaches worked better than others. There are about 20,000 analysts in US intelligence agencies making thousands of estimates about geopolitical developments every year. And yet these agencies had never assessed which forecasts were right, which weren&amp;rsquo;t, and why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Inside the mind of a superforecaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Several intelligence officials ran with the idea of testing. They approached one of our panel members, Phil Tetlock, a leading scholar on expert judgment. Tetlock had recently finished a 20-year study examining how well experts forecasted the future. It was the first large-scale scientific experiment of judgment ever conducted. In it, Tetlock asked a group of nearly 300 experts to make thousands of predictions about economic and political issues of the day: nearly 82,000 predictions in all. His main finding was depressing. The average expert was about as accurate as a dart-throwing chimpanzee, and their predictions were about the same as random guessing. The chimpanzee discovery made headlines. Less noticed was Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s other finding: predicting the future wasn&amp;rsquo;t just lucky guessing. Some people did much, much better than average. He called them superforecasters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In 2011, the IC launched a forecasting tournament to explore what makes some people better forecasters than others. Over the next four years, five teams competed, answering questions every morning ranging from the price of oil at a given time to the prospects of conflict between China and Japan in the East China Sea. There were nearly 500 questions in all. The winner was the team with the best accuracy at predicting things that did not happen as well as things that did. Tetlock and his colleague Barbara Mellers put together a team of thousands of volunteers called the Good Judgment Project. The University of Michigan and MIT each fielded a team. The Intelligence Community did, too. The fifth team was a control group. &amp;ldquo;By varying the experimental conditions, we could gauge which factors improved foresight, by how much, over which time frames,&amp;rdquo; Tetlock later reflected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;By the end of the second year, the results were staggering: Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s volunteer team was winning by a lot. They outperformed other university-affiliated teams at Michigan and MIT by such large margins (30-70 per cent), the other schools were dropped from the competition. Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s team also beat professional intelligence analysts with access to classified data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The best of the best on Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s team, the superforecasters, weren&amp;rsquo;t geniuses with multiple PhDs. They were artists and scientists, students and retirees, &amp;ldquo;Wall Streeters and Main Streeters&amp;rdquo;, as Tetlock put it. Tetlock found that the secret to success wasn&amp;rsquo;t sky-high brilliance or a &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/em&gt;-like mastery of news and facts. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t what superforecasters knew. It was how they thought. Superforecasters are far more open-minded, curious, careful and self-critical than the average person. They believe that reality is complex, nothing is certain or inevitable, and that ideas should always be subjected to evidence, testing and updating. They have what Tetlock calls &amp;ldquo;Dragonfly eyes&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the ability to see a problem with the 30,000 lenses of a dragonfly&amp;rsquo;s eye. While high-functioning groups harness the wisdom of different perspectives that each member brings, superforecasters can harness the wisdom of different perspectives from within, all by themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Perhaps most encouraging, Tetlock and his colleagues have since found in their experiments that superforecasting skills can be learned through training, practice, measurement and feedback. One basic 60-minute tutorial improved accuracy by ten per cent through a tournament year. That may not seem like a lot, but imagine if you had a ten per cent better chance of getting a promotion at work than all the other candidates, or your financial adviser could guarantee a ten per cent better return on your investments. When it comes to forecasting important things, ten per cent can be larger than you think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The future of intelligence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Humans are also getting help from machines. Advances in artificial intelligence offer potentially game-changing capabilities to process volumes of data at radically new speeds and scales, identify patterns across data sooner and more easily, and empower human analysts in new ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In 2020-21, I served on an expert task force that examined future intelligence challenges and opportunities arising from emerging technologies. The task force&amp;rsquo;s research included dozens of interviews and deep-dive sessions with technology leaders and intelligence experts across the US government, private sector and academia. We found that artificial intelligence (AI) and its associated technologies (such as cloud computing, advanced sensors and big data analytics) could transform every core intelligence mission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;We also found that the greatest promise of AI comes from augmenting human analysts, not replacing them. By automating mundane tasks that absorb tremendous amounts of time, AI has the potential to free human analysts to concentrate on higher-level thinking that only humans can do well &amp;ndash; like assessing an adversary&amp;rsquo;s intentions, considering broader context, examining competing hypotheses and identifying what evidence may be missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Harnessing the power of AI to improve intelligence analysis won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. Even the most advanced AI algorithms have severe limitations, including the inability to explain how they reach results and the tendency to fail unexpectedly in the face of seemingly small changes &amp;ndash; like mistaking a picture of a sloth for a racing car when imperceptible changes are made to the image. AI also raises important ethical concerns. And adoption requires overcoming technical, bureaucratic and cultural hurdles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The future of intelligence analysis can be better than the past. Our greater knowledge of cognitive biases, combined with help from AI and training in superforecasting, offers tremendous promise. Notably, US intelligence agencies correctly anticipated Russia&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine and issued public warnings, declassifying and sharing intelligence in real time to an unprecedented degree. The US Intelligence Community stuck by its assessment, even when Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s president doubted it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Physicist Richard Feynman once said that analysis is how we try not to fool ourselves. He&amp;rsquo;s right. Estimating the future will always be a hazardous occupation, especially in intelligence. The world outside is hard to predict, and the world inside our own minds is prone to error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But failure is not inevitable. Trying not to fool ourselves is a worthy endeavour, and evidence suggests we are likely to get better at it over time. We must continue to learn more about the processes and practices that make some individuals and groups more accurate than others, and embrace new technologies that enhance insight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an edited extract from Amy Zegart&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Spies, Lies and Algorithms&amp;rdquo; (Princeton University Press).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2022/04/26/the-results-are-in/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

    <title>*Out of Office Response* Re: quick question?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/19/office-response-re-quick-question/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let’s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook’s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>

In reality, true transparency goes much further than this. We need Clinical Study Reports, and individual patient data, of course. But we also need the consent forms, so we can see what patients were told. We need […]</div>
