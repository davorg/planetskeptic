    <title>Twitter will not fade away in a controlled demolition</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Elon Musk keeps sinking to new depths. In his latest escapade, one of his employees was so baffled by the confusion that reigns at Twitter, he asked for clarification on whether he was still employed or not. He responded by firing him, insulting him, and ridiculing him for having a disability.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/elonfucksup.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/elonfucksup-500x378.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="378" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-69502" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/elonfucksup-500x378.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/elonfucksup-150x113.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/elonfucksup-300x227.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/elonfucksup-768x580.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/elonfucksup.jpeg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a></p>
<p>That’s a lawsuit right there. The man’s disability is muscular dystrophy — he’s going to die from it. Also, one of the reasons for the confusion is that his employment was a special case. He’d founded a company that Twitter bought for $100 million, and he’d generously taken his buyout in the form of wages over an extended time, and the whole sum will come due when his employment ends. Like, when Musk fires him.</p>
<p>Also, he seems to be a genuinely good guy, a kind of anti-Musk.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/halli.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/halli-500x204.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="204" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-69503" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/halli-500x204.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/halli-150x61.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/halli-300x123.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/halli-768x314.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/halli.jpeg 1356w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a></p>
<p>Musk keeps detonating these bombs of incompetence. I agree with this fellow who thinks <a href="https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/how-long-does-twitter-have-left?r=eeyg">Twitter is doomed, and the collapse is coming fast</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s already real bad over there. Elon Musk said yesterday that ad revenues have fallen 50%. The site is experiencing major outages almost once a week. During the most recent outage earlier this week, Elon was laser-focused on the important stuff: reply-guying Jordan Peterson. The Twitter Blue rollout has been such a disaster that he fired almost the entire team. The company isn’t paying rent on its office space. It recently tried to create a new income stream by selling office plants to employees.</p>
<p>But take a deeper look and the company is in even worse shape than it appears. Twitter has two financial time bombs waiting to go off. My hunch is that Elon will file for bankruptcy as soon as one of these time bombs self-detonates. I can’t say exactly when that will be.</p>
<p>I give it about six months.</p></blockquote>
<p>The two time bombs are 1) a battery of lawsuits from all those fired employees for unlawful termination, and 2) a collection of massive fines from the FTC and the EU. He can’t avoid those. He paid too much for a company he bought as a present to his ego, and he’s been making it cataclysmically worse. I’m just biding my time, waiting for the inevitable and spectacular splash when Musk crashes.</p>

<p>Who are the “canceled speakers and stars” he’d invite? It’s not as clean an identity as he imagines. Is Richard Dawkins one of them? Because people have expressed their strong dislike of his views, but he’s not exactly broke and living on the street, and he would still be a strong draw. Would I be one of them? I’ve been canceled by a huge number of atheists, and never get invited to speak at conferences anymore <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f622.png" alt="😢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that even in the limited, select group of regressive atheists who follow David Silverman, his poll couldn’t even break 50% in favor. Not that it actually matters, this is a kind of Elon Musk non-poll where the pollster is going to just ignore the numbers.</p>

    <title>Meet the Indian widows fighting back</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6087/meet-the-indian-widows-fighting-back#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Netradipa Patil has helped create a network of women who are fighting back against widowhood traditions" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/IMG_5358.jpg" height="1447" alt="Netradipa Patil smiles and looks into the camera, her arms folded, wearing a pink and gold sari" width="1448"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For years, community healthcare worker Netradipa Patil had been making her rounds in rural Shirol, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. She enquired into people&amp;rsquo;s health and asked how she could be of assistance. One day, she decided to ask an extra question: &amp;ldquo;How are you feeling today?&amp;rdquo; She noticed that several women didn&amp;rsquo;t even reply. Patil was haunted by their blank stares and silence. What made them feel so low? When she returned soon after, she encouraged these women to speak and spent hours listening to their stories. She discovered they were widows who had been harshly ostracised by their communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are more than 55 million widows living in India today. While dealing with the grief and financial loss often caused by losing their husbands, many of these women are pressured into conforming to traditions that have been described as &amp;ldquo;social death&amp;rdquo;. Excluded from festivals and celebrations, many are expected to stay in their homes for a year or longer after the death. These restrictions are accompanied by stigma. In some remote villages, widows are expelled from the community and sent to shelter homes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;None of these rituals make any sense,&amp;rdquo; says Patil. But in several parts of India, a woman&amp;rsquo;s identity is still tied to that of her husband. &amp;ldquo;This tradition goes back several centuries and the reason it&amp;rsquo;s followed even today is to curb women&amp;rsquo;s freedom and put restrictions on them.&amp;rdquo; If a widow fails to follow these rituals, she is shamed. People may even accuse her of never having loved her husband.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patil was familiar with these customs, but still she was shocked by the women&amp;rsquo;s stories. &amp;ldquo;It left me numb,&amp;rdquo; she says. One woman was a fellow healthcare worker, Lalita Mudshinge. She was in her early 30s when her husband, a tractor driver, died of a heart attack in 2017. Immediately, she was asked to break her bangles, remove the necklace and vermillion mark associated with married women, and refrain from wearing colourful clothes. Furthermore, she was forbidden from participating in weddings, child naming ceremonies and other celebrations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mudshinge was prepared for this ostracisation. She also anticipated being blamed for her husband&amp;rsquo;s death, as many widows are. &amp;ldquo;I kept all the medical records safely and even the autopsy report,&amp;rdquo; she says. But despite the evidence that he had died of cardiac arrest, she was still accused by her in-laws and members of the community of playing a part. They also wanted to force her to stay in the house for a year. This was not possible, as Mudshinge, like Patil, worked as a community healthcare worker, which meant regular trips into the centre of the village.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The men from the village would stalk me in the streets and make bad comments,&amp;rdquo; she said. The abuse reached a stage where even stepping out of her front door began to feel dangerous. &amp;ldquo;I was so stressed and scared that I often fell ill,&amp;rdquo; she says. The social stigma directly impacted her work, with senior staff yelling at her constantly. &amp;ldquo;Mudshinge was suicidal, depressed, and on the verge of leaving her job,&amp;rdquo; Patil says. However, within a few years, she was helping her fellow widows and battling patriarchal attitudes in her country. How did it happen?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The fight back begins&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It all started with that extra question, &amp;ldquo;How are you feeling today?&amp;rdquo; This simple invitation to speak progressed into hours of conversation, as Mudshinge was finally able to explain her plight. Patil gave Mudshinge her contact details and said to reach out at any time. She also started visiting the woman&amp;rsquo;s home and tried to persuade her in-laws to stop practising the widowhood rituals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially, they were not convinced. So, Patil increased the visits. After a few months, Mudshinge began noticing a change. Her in-laws were more accepting of her leaving the house, and even allowed her to wear jewellery and colourful clothes. Men from the community continued to harass her when she did her rounds as a healthcare worker, but after Patil began accompanying her, she found she was more able to face them down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patil was helping five other widows at the time. They were all coping with challenges, and she felt they were not being adequately supported. So she reached out to a fellow healthcare worker in a nearby village. Together, they began to organise awareness sessions for widows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These healthcare workers understand the plight of widows because they are all women and come from rural communities themselves. They are Accredited Social Health Activists, or ASHA workers. There are over a million ASHAs in India: roughly one for every 1,000 people. They are all female and come from the communities they serve. They do everything from prenatal care to administering vaccines, providing medicines for common ailments and maintaining health records for every community member. &lt;br&gt;Patil started to team up with more ASHA workers, reasoning that widowhood was a serious public health matter and should be treated as such. At first, nobody came to the awareness sessions. They had to squeeze in talking to the widows during routine community visits. Finally, after around six months of this work, with remote counselling done by phone, a few women started showing up to the sessions. &amp;ldquo;It was so powerful,&amp;rdquo; Mudshinge says. &amp;ldquo;It helped me muster the courage to face the stigma.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was still a long way to go, however, when it came to acceptance from the community. That&amp;rsquo;s when Patil came up with a unique idea. She invited all the widows from the nearby villages and asked a local government official to join them for a special event. Patil asked the official to celebrate the widows for their heroism in battling the oppressive widowhood rituals. The official agreed. It was a bold move. News spread in the villages and beyond, and the event was covered by the regional media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mudshinge printed the photos and kept them in her wallet. &amp;ldquo;From then on, whenever someone abused me, I showed them these photos, and it helped me,&amp;rdquo; she said. She would never have guessed that a photo could change her life. The event expanded into a series, hosted by several villages in Maharashtra. At each event, widows were celebrated and encouraged to break with the rituals and practices that had brought so much suffering into their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, social activist Pramod Zinjade started a movement asking village heads in Maharashtra to pass a resolution to ban the widowhood rituals outright. In May last year, Herwad became the first village to do so. The state government asked all villages to follow suit, and reportedly 7,500 villages have passed resolutions seeking to curb the practices. However, there are no legal ramifications if these resolutions are not followed through, so it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to say how effective they will be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Just the beginning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Changing local and state policy is important. But the work doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there. As lawyer and activist Amol Naik says, &amp;ldquo;Implementation is the key.&amp;rdquo; Naik has spent over a decade fighting to protect and uphold the rights of women farmers and agricultural labourers, many of whom suffer greatly if they are faced with widowhood. He points out that widows do have legal rights under Indian law &amp;ndash; such as the right to inherit their husband&amp;rsquo;s property &amp;ndash; but often feel unable to assert these rights. &amp;ldquo;Younger widows are ostracised and made to feel that their relatives are doing them a favour by letting them stay [in their own homes]. Eventually, they stop asking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Akkatai Teli is an activist who has spent four decades working with widows and bringing the perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence to justice. She says that many widows aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of their legal rights and there can often be a vested interest in not telling them. &amp;ldquo;Most of them are denied a share in the property and kicked out of the house because the in-laws fear they will ascertain their rights,&amp;rdquo; she says. Many of these women end up in shelter homes. The problem is so severe that in 2018, the government built a shelter home in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, that can accommodate 1,000 widows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patil, meanwhile, has continued to work on the root cause of widows&amp;rsquo; problems. Between 2017 and 2022 she trained a team of 20 women, most of whom are widows themselves, to help combat regressive customs. So far, the network has helped hundreds of widows from over 20 villages in Maharashtra. Her attempts are now being formalised into a full-time support system at the village, district and state levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patil&amp;rsquo;s goal is not just to help these women heal, but to ensure they can live a life of dignity. This involves practical support; ensuring the widows have the correct paperwork to access government welfare, training them to become self-reliant and helping them start their own businesses. She also helps them access mental health treatment. &amp;ldquo;Telling their stories can be triggering for the women,&amp;rdquo; she says, so they have learned to be careful in their work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there is another challenge. As an ASHA, Patil isn&amp;rsquo;t paid for her work with the widows, nor is she trained to provide counselling. &amp;ldquo;The health department doesn&amp;rsquo;t even acknowledge our work,&amp;rdquo; she says. The work with widows is classed as voluntary. She says that ASHAs aren&amp;rsquo;t paid enough in any case, and could achieve much more with adequate compensation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the exact figures vary across states, they are uniformly low. In Maharashtra, ASHAs earn an average of 3,500-5,000 Indian Rupees (&amp;pound;34-50) per month. They are paid per task &amp;ndash; for example, for providing antenatal or postnatal care and overseeing a pregnancy in a public hospital, they earn &amp;pound;4.90. &amp;ldquo;ASHAs are a support system for millions of people,&amp;rdquo; Patil points out. &amp;ldquo;If the government starts paying us adequately and on time, many [more] ASHAs can help women recover from their trauma.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A turning point&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ongoing support is important, as even if the lives of widows improve, they still have to recover from the abuse and ostracisation. When Anjali Pehelwan, 39, lost her husband to Covid, her relatives weren&amp;rsquo;t concerned about her grief. &amp;ldquo;All they wanted was to forcefully take away my jewellery and toe rings,&amp;rdquo; she remembers. Although Pehelwan resisted, a few women pulled off her jewellery, bruising and cutting her. The cuts healed in a week, she says, but it took a year before she recovered from the mental trauma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily, Pehelwan was able to access support. She was put in touch with Maya Patil, the ASHA worker who had helped Netradipa organise the very first awareness sessions for widows. (Netradipa and Maya share a last name but are not related.) Maya Patil started counselling Pehelwan on the phone and in person. Gradually, Pehelwan started wearing her jewellery again, began to leave the house, and started asking people to treat her as an equal to other women. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. &amp;ldquo;The community members were so aghast that they started calling me ill-omened and a witch,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in April 2022, Maya Patil came up with the idea of celebrating Gudi Padwa (Maharashtra&amp;rsquo;s new year), considered to be the most auspicious occasion in the Hindu calendar. &amp;ldquo;Traditionally, while a widow is allowed to celebrate this occasion, they are barred from performing any rituals,&amp;rdquo; Pehelwan explains. Maya Patil was determined to change this. She called a group of 20 women together, including Pehelwan and another widow. &amp;ldquo;I started talking about the discriminatory practices and why we should raise our voice,&amp;rdquo; she says. At first, the other women stepped away from the widows, but Patil wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give up. She convinced them to celebrate the new year festival together, with Pehelwan taking the lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a backlash from certain members of the community. People spread a rumour that Pehelwan was celebrating the festival because she had remarried. (Widows in India are allowed to remarry, but in reality they are often ostracised if they do.) A scandal was brewing, but fortunately the local journalists reported the event accurately, confirming that Pehelwan was still single. &amp;ldquo;That was the best time to shut down all such conspiracy theories,&amp;rdquo; she recalls, laughing at the memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, Pehelwan discovered that there were 450 widows and separated women in her village of Arjunwad alone. &amp;ldquo;We need to stop using the word &amp;lsquo;widow&amp;rsquo; and come up with better words,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Widow&amp;rsquo; is never a woman&amp;rsquo;s identity. It&amp;rsquo;s no fault of hers that her husband has died.&amp;rdquo; She found that many women wanted to oppose the rituals, but didn&amp;rsquo;t speak up because of the patriarchal system. &amp;ldquo;My goal is to help them voice their concerns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pehelwan works long hours as a data entry operator. But although her work is tiring, she spends her evenings taking phone calls from other widows, encouraging them to leave the house and assert their rights. &amp;ldquo;People think it&amp;rsquo;s a burden, but it&amp;rsquo;s not,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Whenever I see a woman healing, I feel I have given someone a new life. While this can never make up for my loss, I am proud to help bring an end to the trauma of other women.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The bikers' bible</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Robert Pirsig's 1974 bestseller continues to serve as a gospel for long-distance bikers" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/iswanto-arif-m1nHYuMvBAI-unsplash-small.jpg" height="1448" alt="A man on a motorbike in the mountains" width="1448"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, published in 1974, was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon. A work of fictionalised autobiography, the book follows its author Robert Pirsig on a long motorcycle ride through the US, from Minnesota across the prairie to Oregon, then down to southern California. The muscles of that skeletal journey are Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s philosophical musings on the notion of Quality. Pirsig created the concept in order explain the relationship between human values and societal values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At once both obvious and ephemeral, Quality escapes easy definition. (And brings to mind American supreme court justice Potter Stewart&amp;rsquo;s comments about pornography: &amp;ldquo;I know it when I see it.&amp;rdquo;) In his original formulation, Pirsig describes it, not a little paradoxically, as &amp;ldquo;a characteristic of thought and statement that is recognised by a non-thinking or intuitive process.&amp;rdquo; At another juncture, Quality is defined as the event which occurs between the observer and the observed. Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s search for clarity stretched his mind to the breaking point, ultimately landing him in a psychiatric facility where he was subjected to electroshock therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet, the concept has been influential. The book, a bestseller, continues to be read by motorcyclists, philosophers and everyone in between. This year, a long-awaited collection of writings has been published for the first time, giving us a deeper look at how Pirsig shaped his concept. Edited by Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s widow Wendy, an archivist and Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s frequent collaborator, On Quality uses outtakes from unpublished letters and lectures, and from Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s two books (Zen and 1991&amp;rsquo;s Lila). It is an intimate and highly selective look at his journey through the work of the early Greek philosophers, Asiatic mysticism and beyond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again and again, he approaches the concept from different angles, employing simile, analogy and deductive reasoning. Often, he only tightens the knot he has created. But there are moments of brilliance. In a letter written in 1995, Pirsig outlined where he saw Quality fitting among the pantheon of religious philosophy, placing it beside Hinduism&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Oneness&amp;rdquo; Buddhism&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Nothingness&amp;rdquo; and the monotheist&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; as a fourth path leading up &amp;ldquo;the mountain of understanding&amp;rdquo;. Optimistically, he singles out Quality as the one that cannot be dismissed by the &amp;ldquo;scientifically minded&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;meaningless, metaphysical claptrap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quality then, is a kind of religion, though one preaching improvement for its own sake, rather than in the service of some deity. It is less concerned with eternal life than with the pursuit of truth and beauty. Much of its appeal lies in Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s prose, which combines his repetitive, mantra-like style with a pragmatic, matter-of-fact charm. The book is illustrated with photos of his collection of tools &amp;ndash; spanners, drills, pliers and the like &amp;ndash; a reminder that this was a philosopher with dirt under his fingernails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The goal of truth&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I first read Pirsig in 2012, while preparing for my own long motorcycle journey, from the Canadian prairie to the Argentinian Pampa. It strikes me now as a voyage from one cattle country to another, though at that time it was too sinuous and ill-planned to be so clearly defined. I had none of Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s discipline, but like him, I struggled to find meaning in what I was pursuing. Was I travelling as catharsis? For freedom? For evasion? Adventure seemed the most likely reason, but I was too often alone and inconsolable to convince myself of that pursuit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Quality is the quasi-religion of what Pirsig called the &amp;ldquo;Church of Reason&amp;rdquo;, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is its holy book. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one to treat it as such. Motorcyclists I met on that trip, and have met since, talk about Zen as a kind of compendium for life. Like most adherents, there was among them more enthusiasm (which means, as Pirsig points out, &amp;ldquo;filled with theos&amp;rdquo;, or God) for Pirsig than drive for understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Zen was first published, motorcycle travel literature was not yet the identifiable genre it is today. That variety of travelogue began in earnest in 1979 with the appearance of Ted Simon&amp;rsquo;s Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s Travels, the story of a five-year round-the-world odyssey between 1973 and 1977. If Pirsig was a kind of modern Homer, Simon was like Virgil: pagan and worldly, inured in scholarship of prose, yet beset with laurels of deism. &amp;ldquo;Of all the gods in the pantheon,&amp;rdquo; he wrote, &amp;ldquo;Jupiter is the one I fancy most. A lovely name, Jupiter, like cream and honey in the mouth. And a sense of great distance and closeness at the same time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compare that to Pirsig, who wrote in Zen that &amp;ldquo;The primary goal of the Church of Reason... is always Socrates&amp;rsquo; old goal of truth, in its ever-changing forms, as it&amp;rsquo;s revealed by the process of rationality.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why motorcyclists might choose the path of Simon&amp;rsquo;s self-aggrandisement over Pirsig&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;goal of truth&amp;rdquo;. There was always the temptation to play at being god. While my own pan-American odyssey was underway, I came to recognise a particular mindset in fellow riders: an air of being separate in space and time, of being out of reality and untouchable. There were plenty of vengeful Odins and chaotic brothers of Mars riding into town with conquering on their minds. My own choice of god at the time was the callous and boozy Dionysus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unambiguously foreign, strangely dressed, noisy, incorrigible, we rode our machines across the world as though it were the plains of Troy. We were given beds, food and love &amp;ndash; offerings we accepted as tributes for our appearance on the battlefield. When we left, it was not uncommon for crowds of people to appear to see us off. The effect was inebriating, nectar for the ego. Today, those events put me in mind of Patrick Kavanagh&amp;rsquo;s poem &amp;ldquo;Epic&amp;rdquo;, which ends with the lines: &amp;ldquo;Till Homer&amp;rsquo;s ghost came whispering to my mind. / He said: I made the Iliad from such / A local row. Gods make their own importance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wreaking havoc&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But therein lies the trouble with gods &amp;ndash; they do not go out into the world to learn, but to teach, to wreak havoc, have their way with mortals; they live in the world as they want it, rather than as it is. Passing through one country after another, often without our &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo; documents, and with the freedom of our vehicles, we felt that we had passed beyond the rules of society. I rode all over the Americas illegally, my expired paperwork needing only a few flicks of my pen to change the date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why travelers feel out of step with the world around them. Society is largely based on repetition and reliability, neither of which travel provides. But enough time ignoring the rules and a detached superiority begins to settle in. And then, the worst: bored with the thrills offered by the natural world, by spontaneity, by socialising, such riders turn from life to arithmetic: tallying up miles ridden, countries entered, tyres blown, meals eaten. Quantity becomes synonymous with merit, and the most venerable are those who have &amp;ldquo;done more&amp;rdquo;. As the urge to quantify rises, Quality suffers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simon ends Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s Travels with this reflection: &amp;ldquo;Often I dream of riding over the hard red floor of a great forest, beneath a high canopy of translucent green, spreading on and on. An enchanted forest, perhaps, where men may still sometimes play at being gods.&amp;rdquo; Pirsig ends Zen in a very different manner, by saying that &amp;ldquo;to understand Quality, he would have to leave the mythos.&amp;rdquo; It continues: &amp;ldquo;[he] emerges as if from a dream, seeing that his whole consciousness, the mythos, has been a dream and no one&amp;rsquo;s dream but his own, a dream he must now sustain of his own efforts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is much to admire in motorcycle writing, but too much of it today is a poor imitation of the genre&amp;rsquo;s forefathers. We will not produce another writer like Robert Pirsig until we can differentiate quantity from Quality. And we have to stop playing at being gods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This article is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: The Age of the Strongman</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6085/book-review-the-age-of-the-strongman#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ageofstrongman.jpg" height="697" alt="The Age of the Strongman by Gideon Rachman" width="462"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Age of the Strongman&lt;/strong&gt; (Bodley Head) by Gideon Rachman&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rivalry between democracy and autocracy promises to define much of this century. The Age of the Strongman by the Financial Times&amp;rsquo; chief foreign affairs commentator Gideon Rachman attempts to explain how we got here. The central thrust is that, since the 1990s, the rise of a certain type of leader has become the key feature of &amp;ldquo;the most sustained global assault on liberal democracy since the 1930s&amp;rdquo;. By profiling 14 current-day leaders with authoritarian tendencies &amp;ndash; from central Europe to South America to the Philippines &amp;ndash; Rachman hopes to provide &amp;ldquo;political liberals&amp;rdquo; with an &amp;ldquo;understanding of what they are dealing with&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachman begins with an outline of the &amp;ldquo;playbook&amp;rdquo; that has propelled strongmen into power. A common tactic is populist nationalism, which paints the strongman as a national saviour, pitting an ethnically and/or religiously defined nation against outside threats such as minority groups, migrants or a shadowy elite. In power, the erosion of civil liberties is a natural consequence. Rachman reminds us how strongmen have subjugated ethnic and religious communities in their countries. Whilst China&amp;rsquo;s Xi detains Uyghurs in &amp;ldquo;re-education&amp;rdquo; camps, Narendra Modi has effectively stripped millions of Muslims of their Indian citizenship. Independent institutions and organisations are neutered. While some strongmen, like Viktor Orb&amp;aacute;n, are known for hollowing out their country&amp;rsquo;s independent media, others, like Vladimir Putin, preside over countries where journalists regularly turn up dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachman refuses to explain the rise of this authoritarianism through the talents of strongmen alone, nor does he assert that certain countries are predisposed to this rule. Chapters on Boris Johnson and Donald Trump dispel the myth that the west is impervious to democratic decline. Instead, Rachman argues that the success of strongmen is a &amp;ldquo;symptom of the crisis of liberalism&amp;rdquo;, which has economic, political and diplomatic dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Driving this crisis, according to Rachman, is an &amp;ldquo;overconfidence in the power of liberal ideas born from &amp;lsquo;victory&amp;rsquo; in the Cold War&amp;rdquo;. This prevented politicians and commentators from judging the true character of strongmen early in their careers. Rachman includes himself in this, going so far as to quote from one of his past articles that celebrated Modi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;thrilling&amp;rdquo; rise. The free market&amp;rsquo;s most ardent defenders have since had to reckon with the compatibility of the system with authoritarianism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But despite beginning what promises to be a meaningful critique of the liberal world order, Rachman never quite gets down to it. Instead, he regresses into clich&amp;eacute;. His acknowledgement of the ills of globalisation is descriptive at best. The term &amp;ldquo;neoliberalism&amp;rdquo; is dismissed as an invention of the populist left, as if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the object of serious academic enquiry. Meanwhile, strongman critiques of the liberal world order go unexplored. Grievances against US foreign policy, Nato and the EU &amp;ndash; some of which may be justified &amp;ndash; are dismissed. It is unclear what Rachman has learnt from reckoning with post-Cold War politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This reversion to type is finalised in the book&amp;rsquo;s conclusion, where the strongman is dismissed as a short-lived fad, and we are told to trust the US to lead a new &amp;ldquo;human-rights based world order&amp;rdquo;. Rachman fails to take seriously the US&amp;rsquo; vulnerability to a Trump-like resurgence, or the grisly legacy of its foreign intervention since the Second World War. In the end, his pages are haunted by the same liberal overconfidence he finds complicit in the rise of the strongman. To strengthen liberalism against rising authoritarianism requires tougher questions of its historical record; perhaps even a consideration about the case for reinvention, something Rachman firmly rules out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

By that time, she had founded her own company, BioViva.

In capitalism we must keep earning to stop our financial debt growing. This moral imperative is analogous with the prevalent framing of fitness today as an endless and unresolvable quest: one can always be fitter, and not pursuing this goal is a failing to oneself and to society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A: Anna Lembke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The program director of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Fellowship talks to &lt;strong&gt;J.P.

    <title>Hunting for Vakulenko</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6083/hunting-for-vakulenko#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Mass graves in Izium, Ukraine" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2K1D0CX.jpg" height="667" alt="Mass graves in Izium, Ukraine." width="1000"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It was a beautiful, fresh October day in the pine forest near Izium, eastern Ukraine, when I walked among the empty graves, avoiding the discarded plastic gowns and gloves &amp;ndash; the Russian army trash. The sandy ground, once a place for picnics, was marred by gaping holes, splintered coffins, makeshift markers and spooled police tape. 447 people had been exhumed here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ahead and behind me, Ukrainian writers &amp;ndash; from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and elsewhere &amp;ndash; also lost for words, were moving slowly through the carnage. They had come, a &lt;br&gt;busload of them, to the recently liberated areas east of Kharkiv, looking for news of their colleague Volodymyr Vakulenko. Looking for grave 319, and hoping that the rumours were true, that he was never there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;He was a very special man,&amp;rdquo; his friend Maksym Bespalov told me, then immediately corrected himself. &amp;ldquo;He is a very special man. Idealistic.&amp;rdquo; They&amp;rsquo;d met more than a decade ago &amp;ndash; Volodymyr was hugely active in the literary scene, publishing almanacs and magazines, getting published himself and winning awards for his books and poetry, organising festivals and encouraging younger writers. He turned to children&amp;rsquo;s books after the birth of his son. Maksym tells me Volodymyr &amp;ldquo;tries to be everywhere, involved in everything. A little bit crazy, perhaps. But we like him because he is him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;What are his ideals, I asked Maksym. Without hesitation, he replied: &amp;ldquo;For all of the good versus all of the bad&amp;rdquo;. Volodymyr was an idealist; an outspoken, strident patriot who didn&amp;rsquo;t just write about the Ukrainian struggle but put himself on the line during the revolution of 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Those who loved and admired Volodymyr &amp;ndash; and there are many &amp;ndash; had hopes he was in a Russian prison, awaiting trial. &amp;ldquo;We all understand the most truthful version is that he is dead,&amp;rdquo; Maksym said bluntly. &amp;ldquo;But when we speak about Volodya, we always say that we hope he&amp;rsquo;s still alive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It was a hope shared by Olena Ihnatenko, the writer&amp;rsquo;s mother. Our next stop, once we&amp;rsquo;d made it through half-destroyed Izium and down cratered roads to the village of Kapytolivka, was Olena&amp;rsquo;s flat. She lives with her husband Vasyl and, now, Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s son Vitalik, who has autism and cannot speak. Volodymyr had hoped that the fact he was Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s sole guardian would mean the soldiers would leave him alone. He was wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Abducting a civilian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;We all crammed into the flat and sat on the floor around Olena and Vasyl, like schoolchildren being told a story. They described the bombardment, the month in a cellar, the freezing cold and near-starvation. Then the troops arriving in the bombers&amp;rsquo; wake. Volodymyr, who had been living with Vitalik and his own father elsewhere in the village, apparently ran out when the soldiers came, and shouted, &amp;ldquo;The rashists are here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rashist&amp;rdquo; is a neat portmanteau of Russian, racist and fascist that provokes ire in Russian soldiers: it expresses the widely-held Ukrainian view that Russians are now little different to Hitler&amp;rsquo;s forces, which also invaded at 4am, 81 years earlier. It was in keeping with Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s stubborn, proud and undaunted character that he would shout this as the invaders arrived. It was also incredibly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Vasyl, with pure white hair and bushy eyebrows, seems a kind, gentle old man; as he speaks to us he is calming Vitalik, stroking his shoulder and murmuring to him. Vitalik is rocking, agitated, staring at the strangers. He knows what&amp;rsquo;s going on, his grandmother insists &amp;ndash; just can&amp;rsquo;t express himself. The idea of this highly strung, nervous boy being seized by troops is almost incomprehensible. But on 22 March, that&amp;rsquo;s what happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s your nationalist?&amp;rdquo; a soldier nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Bes&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Demon&amp;rdquo;, had demanded of Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s elderly father. His men turned the house upside down looking for pro-Ukrainian literature. Volodymyr, sensibly, had hidden the flags he&amp;rsquo;d kept from his time on the Maidan &amp;ndash; Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Revolution of Dignity&amp;rdquo;, which overthrew corrupt ruler Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Both Volodymyr and Vitalik were taken to a nearby &amp;ldquo;special department&amp;rdquo; for a few hours, where Volodymyr was beaten, then both were returned home. Olena thinks it was probably a mistake that they took Vitalik. But Volodymyr knew they&amp;rsquo;d be back for him. It was at this point he took a shovel and dug a hole under the cherry tree in his father&amp;rsquo;s garden. He buried the notebook in which he&amp;rsquo;d been describing their life under occupation.&amp;ldquo;Give it to our guys [as everyone calls the Ukrainian Armed Forces] when they come,&amp;rdquo; he told his father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;A little later the soldiers returned, grabbed the writer while he was cooking on an open fire in the garden, and threw him into a bus on which they&amp;rsquo;d daubed their infamous invasion symbol, the latin letter &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The torture of not knowing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;For Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s ex-wife, Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s mother Iryna Novitska, the lack of information was unbearable. She lives in central Ukraine and had begged him, as everyone had, to get out while he still could. Their last communication was on 7 March when he&amp;rsquo;d called to say troops had entered the village. Then a message, later that night: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve wiped my phone contacts&amp;rdquo;, to protect their identities from the soldiers, in case he was picked up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The mobile networks were knocked out, one by one. Silence. Kapytolivka, like all the other villages and towns the Russians occupied, was swallowed up. It just disappeared into an information blackout for six long months. Relatives in free Ukraine had no idea if their loved ones in the occupied territories were hungry or fed, wounded or safe, imprisoned, scared . . . dead. Meanwhile, those inside the &amp;ldquo;dark zone&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t know what had become of the rest of the country. Propaganda from Moscow told them lies: Kharkiv has fallen, Kyiv has fallen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In the occupied towns, troops &amp;ndash; both from Russia and conscripts from the so-called &amp;ldquo;republics&amp;rdquo; of Donetsk and Luhansk &amp;ndash; roamed the streets, drunk and dangerous, searching men for &amp;ldquo;patriotic&amp;rdquo; tattoos, and taking them to torture cells, ten of which were later found in Izium alone. Informers were apparently active in the village. Volodomyr&amp;rsquo;s family suspect this is how he was picked up. Long before the invasion, he had predicted that the neighbours would turn him in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Throughout the spring and summer, 71-year-old Olena, struggling with the lack of food, medicine, gas, water and electricity, traipsed back and forth to checkpoints and distant military commanders&amp;rsquo; offices, searching for information about her son, and pleading with the Russians to let him go. The couple made written statements to the new &amp;ldquo;authorities&amp;rdquo;; detailed descriptions of Volodymyr and his arrest. The men promised they weren&amp;rsquo;t holding him; scoffed at the very suggestion. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not Nazis!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Some rumours reached her; that her Vovka was in Russia, awaiting trial. Or in a prison in occupied Donetsk. After the region was liberated in September, there was a terrible confusion over the mass grave lists: &amp;ldquo;Vakulenko&amp;rdquo; from Kapytolivka was listed. But no date of death was given, and authorities said it was a woman&amp;rsquo;s body in that pit. Could it have been a mistake? &amp;ldquo;I am living on hope,&amp;rdquo; Olena told me, that day in October. &amp;ldquo;I have to. He&amp;rsquo;s my only son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The Executed Renaissance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The idea that a children&amp;rsquo;s writer can be murdered because he believed in his own country is so absurd, so appalling, that you want to find another version of events to believe in. But actually, none of the writers I was with seemed surprised by what had likely happened to Volodymyr. Horrified, deeply angry, but not surprised. The killing of writers and artists, of creative people who shape a national culture, is nothing new in the grim history of Ukrainian&amp;ndash;Russian relations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Back in Kharkiv with the writers, I stayed one cold and eerie night in a building that stands as testament to Russia&amp;rsquo;s repeated attempts to wipe out Ukrainian cultural life: the House of the Word, or Slovo. Built in the late 1920s, it contained high-end apartments that accommodated Ukrainian writers and intellectuals. They were prized by the state in the brief period when Kharkiv was capital of Soviet Ukraine and had a flourishing literary scene. But then came the 1930s. The very idea of Ukrainian culture became anathema. In the countryside, Stalin killed millions with man-made famine, and in Kharkiv&amp;rsquo;s Slovo he killed the poets, playwrights and novelists. I lay awake in the dark listening to intermittent air-raid sirens and thinking of the night-time knocks from NKVD officers which preceded the execution of 33 of this building&amp;rsquo;s residents. But their senseless deaths &amp;ndash; many in a camp in northwest Russia &amp;ndash; did not prevent this group, known as the Executed Renaissance, from having a lasting influence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Victoria Amelina is their cultural descendant: a writer who vividly describes life, who is actively engaged in that old, old struggle to build a sovereign, free Ukraine. It was she who dug up Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s notebook in September, shortly after the Russians had fled Kapytolivka. She was in the area to document war crimes with an NGO. It took a few minutes of digging to find the little parcel. The day made a lasting, deep impression on her. &amp;ldquo;When you&amp;rsquo;re digging up the diary of a kidnapped writer from under a cherry tree, well &amp;ndash; you feel you&amp;rsquo;re somewhere in the 30s, when our writers were shot. Or in the 40s, under Nazi occupation,&amp;rdquo; she told a TV news crew covering the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Victoria [who was interviewed in the Summer 2022 &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt;] kept a little acorn from the garden that day, a physical memory, and was still carrying it in her pocket when we spoke in November. &amp;ldquo;You know they took literature from his room?&amp;rdquo; she asked me. &amp;ldquo;Books with blue and yellow, or the trident [the Ukrainian national symbol]. They took some as proof of his being Ukrainian, they equal this with &amp;lsquo;Nazi&amp;rsquo;. This is how genocidal logic works.&amp;rdquo; With the family&amp;rsquo;s permission she handed the diary to the Kharkiv Literary Museum for safekeeping. &amp;ldquo;The museum has manuscripts of writers from the Executed Renaissance period; it&amp;rsquo;s symbolic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;When I go to the museum, on a cold November day marked by power blackouts and snowfall, the curator, wearing white cotton gloves, gently pulls back the tissue paper and shows me the densely scrawled text, in black and red biro, scored out in places and spilling over into the margins. The very last line Volodymyr wrote in the diary he buried &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I believe in victory!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; is the same line I hear across Ukraine, day after day, week after week, as the war grinds on and people cling to their faith in their armed forces to drive out the occupier. Belief &amp;ndash; hope &amp;ndash; is non-negotiable. You must keep it, in order to keep going in the face of horror and terror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But hope can be terrible too. After the bodies from the mass graves were exhumed and taken to Kharkiv for analysis in September, the family were told to wait for DNA results. Olena still felt her son was alive. Nobody released from Izium&amp;rsquo;s many torture basements had seen Volodya that whole time. Perhaps he&amp;rsquo;d gone to prison?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In mid-November, while in Donbas reporting near the front line, I got a message from Iryna Novitska, Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s ex-wife. &amp;ldquo;Hope has turned to darkness,&amp;rdquo; she said simply. A photograph had emerged: gruesome, awful and irrefutably depicting Volodymyr before he was buried. Olena had seen it. It was all over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ukrainian journalists found the man who took the picture &amp;ndash; a local, tasked with collecting bodies and burying them in the pine forest during the occupation. He&amp;rsquo;d taken photos so relatives could identify the bodies later. Volodymyr&amp;rsquo;s body had not been taken from a morgue or basement but from a spot by the side of the road where he may have lain for weeks. The body had bullet holes in the stomach and chest, from a Soviet-era &amp;ldquo;Makarov&amp;rdquo; pistol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Echoes of the past&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The next day I took a detour on the way back to Kharkiv, to see Olena one last time. She was heartbroken and furious, thinking back to those long months walking, exhausted, round the checkpoints for information. She recalled a meeting in April with a Russian commander, how he looked at the wall behind her, not meeting her gaze: &amp;ldquo;He said, &amp;lsquo;We&amp;rsquo;re looking, there&amp;rsquo;s no information&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and I knew then that he knew everything,&amp;rdquo; she said, shaking with anger. &amp;ldquo;Where my son was, what happened to him, everything. There was not the slightest point &amp;ndash; everyone knew, but no one was going to say.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s cartoons were playing in the background, and he was laughing at the TV. She hadn&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to tell him yet. He and Volodymyr were joined at the hip. It pained her that this boy was left without a father. She won&amp;rsquo;t be able to cope with his 24-hour-care for ever. Volodymyr used to joke with his mother that he&amp;rsquo;d live a long life, always taking care of Vitalik, going to a nursing home together in old age so they could be together for ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh and what have you done,&amp;rdquo; she cried suddenly, berating her son. &amp;ldquo;What have you done, oh God, oh my God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As a writer, his ex-wife Iryna said, Volodymyr &amp;ldquo;tried to say something in a way that no one had said before&amp;rdquo;. He loved the unusual, the amazing, the unique; his interests were wide-ranging, and though his heart and soul were in the Ukrainian fight, he made common cause with other people living under the shadow of Moscow&amp;rsquo;s empire: the Crimean Tatars, Armenians, Ichkerians, Belarussians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The investigation into who shot him and why will go on, as will countless others; a long slow reckoning that will never provide all the answers. But the soldiers who took Volodymyr were clear: it was his &amp;ldquo;nationalism&amp;rdquo; that made him guilty. So many stories like this have been uncovered, of Russian soldiers convinced by propaganda back home that Ukraine is a nest of Nazis. Stripping people and ransacking houses for &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; like blue and yellow ribbons, trident tattoos, books in their own language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Too often in this war, the echoes of the past are deafening: not just of the atrocities committed by the Nazis, but of Stalin&amp;rsquo;s terror the decade before that. We, in recent years, comfortably consigned all that to history, at least in Europe. The mass executions and jackbooted soldiers, the columns of tanks and sadistic torturers, informants and brave resisters, existed in a black-and-white era.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;To the Ukrainian woman digging up a diary of a disappeared children&amp;rsquo;s writer, just a few miles away from the heavy stench of mass graves, it is not history. Victoria Amelina thinks she knows why it&amp;rsquo;s happened again: there was never any reckoning for the Soviet Union&amp;rsquo;s crimes in Ukraine. And certainly no reckoning for what she calls the &amp;ldquo;annihilation of an entire generation of Ukrainian culture&amp;rdquo; in the 1930s: the execution of all those writers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As there were blacklists then, there are blacklists now, she concluded. Activists, influencers, people to be removed first. The Russians [according to Ukrainian authorities] came with 45,000 body bags. &amp;ldquo;But they expected to win the war in three days,&amp;rdquo; Victoria said. &amp;ldquo;So those thousands of body bags were for whom? For me, I guess, and everyone else like me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2022/04/26/the-results-are-in/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;
