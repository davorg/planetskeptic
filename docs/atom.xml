&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Ken Ham is irate about another thing: &lt;a href="https://answersingenesis.org/culture/80-percent-of-teenagers-expect-to-cohabitate/"&gt;kids today are &lt;em&gt;cohabiting&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/a&gt; They aren&amp;#8217;t sufficiently dedicated to &lt;em&gt;marriage&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We certainly do live in a very secularized culture. The once-Christianized veneer (the Judeo-Christian ethic based on biblical morality) has worn off, and secularism and moral relativism have taken its place. And study after study just continues to confirm how secular this nation really has become. For example, according to a new study, nearly 80%—almost 8 in 10—of US teenagers (15–19 years old) “expect to cohabit before marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s wrong with that? Be happy together, I say. Who are you, Ken Ham, to tell others how to live their lives? I know, you&amp;#8217;ve got your holy book, but that book doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be a very good guide to living well. He can claim some experience with marriage, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mally and I will celebrate 50 years of marriage this December. I am so thankful for a wife who has been one with me in the ministry God called us to. Without her, the ministry of AiG would not be where it is today or even exist. I can honestly say we love each other more than ever. And what is the core factor for a stable marriage? Having a third “partner”: the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know ol&amp;#8217; Ken doesn&amp;#8217;t understand elementary logic, but I can say that &lt;q&gt;Having a third “partner”: the Lord Jesus Christ&lt;/q&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t actually a core factor in a stable marriage. I&amp;#8217;ve been happily married and in a strong relationship for 42 years now, and so far, Jesus has not horned in even once. We&amp;#8217;d be horrified and kick him out if he tried to crawl into bed with us, the creep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to suggest that being married for a long time confers some special virtue on a couple. People can grow apart. One partner can be an intolerable jerk. There are many reasons why a marriage might break up, and it&amp;#8217;s better to separate than to live in miserable company. Also, I should note that there are marriages that Kenny boy disapproves of, such as same-sex marriages, that bring joy to people&amp;#8217;s lives and can last a long time, and some of them also have Jesus in the relationship, and some don&amp;#8217;t. Some even have Allah dancing with them in their imagination! It&amp;#8217;s all good. You really don&amp;#8217;t need a third partner…although, uh-oh, some marriages actually do involve three or more actual physical flesh-and-blood people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logic isn&amp;#8217;t going to persuade him, I&amp;#8217;m afraid. How about revelation? When I was reading his hateful post, a song popped up on my playlist, as if by a miracle. It sounds relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tHAhnJbGy9M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how it works&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#8217;re young until you&amp;#8217;re not&lt;br /&gt;
You love until you don&amp;#8217;t&lt;br /&gt;
You try until you can&amp;#8217;t&lt;br /&gt;
You laugh until you cry&lt;br /&gt;
You cry until you laugh&lt;br /&gt;
And everyone must breathe&lt;br /&gt;
Until their dyin&amp;#8217; breath&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, this is how it works&lt;br /&gt;
You peer inside yourself&lt;br /&gt;
You take the things you like&lt;br /&gt;
Then try to love the things you took&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you take that love you made&lt;br /&gt;
And stick it into some&lt;br /&gt;
Someone else&amp;#8217;s heart&lt;br /&gt;
Pumpin&amp;#8217; someone else&amp;#8217;s blood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And walking arm in arm&lt;br /&gt;
You hope it don&amp;#8217;t get harmed&lt;br /&gt;
But even if it does&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#8217;ll just do it all again, and…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told me that you should listen to it, Ken Ham, and take it to heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;You know that obscene revolting troll who comes by every once in a while with a new pseudonym, who then drops a torrent of racist, anti-semitic, misogynistic, homophobic, and transphobic comments? And then I have to take a few minutes to delete every one of his abusive comments, and ban another pseudonym?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if I didn&amp;#8217;t carry out that last step. Most of you wouldn&amp;#8217;t be coming back, and the nastiness would pile up without end until all value in the conversation was lost. Curating and policing the comments section is an essential part of running a site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or imagine a grocery store where no workers responded to those &amp;#8220;clean up on aisle 5&amp;#8221; requests. It would quickly become a filthy, neglected garbage dump that no one would want to shop at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can stop imagining. All you need to do is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/28/musk-twitter-racist-posts/"&gt;observe Twitter in the near future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emboldened cast of anonymous trolls spewed racist slurs and Nazi memes onto Twitter in the hours after billionaire industrialist Elon Musk took over the social network Thursday, raising fears of how his pledge of unrestricted free speech could fuel a new wave of online hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has struggled to enforce its rules against harassment and extremism, and the company has not yet published any broad-scale changes to its content-moderation policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Musk, a self-described “free speech absolutist,” has fiercely criticized the company’s previous leaders as overly rigid and suppressive and said he would work to overturn some of the company’s main enforcement mechanisms, such as indefinitely suspending accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already. The trolls leapt into furious masturbatory action at the first opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Elon now controls twitter. Unleash the racial slurs. K&amp;#8212;S AND N&amp;#8212;&amp;#8211;S,” said one account, using slurs for Jews and Black people. “I can freely express how much I hate n&amp;#8212;&amp;#8211;s … now, thank you elon,” another said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much, Elon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One account, created this month, included a Nazi swastika as its profile picture and retweeted quotes from Musk alongside antisemitic memes. Another tweet, showing a video montage glorifying Nazi Germany with the comment, “I hear that there have been some changes around here,” was liked more than 400 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racial slurs were posted rampantly overnight. One single-word tweet, showing a single racial slur in all capital letters, was retweeted more than 500 times and liked more than 4,000 times. It was tweeted at 9 p.m. Thursday night and remained online nearly 12 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter was never particularly responsive to racist trolling, and I would guess that now, when the employees are looking at only a 1 in 4 chance of being retained, they are even less motivated to do a cleanup. I can tell you as someone who maintains a teeny-tiny site on the internet, keeping it tidy and functional requires constant vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, advertisers! Unless you&amp;#8217;re selling MAGA hats, Confederate flags, and chloroquinone &amp;#8212; that is, those kinds of trolls are your customers &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t think Twitter is going to be a useful medium for long. The only good part of that sentence is the idea that Musk just burned up $44 billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wonder how advertisers are going to like the n word app &lt;a href="https://t.co/c1UizfHRmQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/c1UizfHRmQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Not a great start</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/10/28/not-a-great-start/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;You know, all the rich sociopaths have to buy their own social media site to make sure no one can talk about how awful they are. Facebook, Parler, Gab, Gettr, Truth Social, now all absorbed by greedy rich people trying to build cozy little nests for their abhorrent views. Well, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/27/twitter-elon-musk/"&gt;Elon Musk now owns Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. What is the first thing a committed Free Speech warrior would do, to demonstrate that commitment? How about firing a bunch of people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk became Twitter’s owner late Thursday as his $44 billion deal to take over the company officially closed, marking a new era for one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of his first moves, he fired several longtime top Twitter executives, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. One of those confirmed the deal was complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also said he plans to cut the Twitter workforce by 75%. At the same time, he&amp;#8217;s been anxious to reassure advertisers that oh no, he&amp;#8217;s not going to turn Twitter into &lt;q&gt;a free-for-all hellscape&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dear Twitter Advertisers &lt;a href="https://t.co/GMwHmInPAS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GMwHmInPAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585619322239561728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 27, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, he just sank $44 billion into this purchase, he&amp;#8217;d rather not see it immediately collapse. Most of that money came from other financial backers, too, and they don&amp;#8217;t want to see their investment callapse, either. I expect we&amp;#8217;re going to see only slow changes in the service for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like letting Trump back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I know for sure is that the new ownership is not going to lead to improvements in Twitter. It&amp;#8217;s all going to go to shit, with the only question being how quickly. Start preparing for your departure, if you&amp;#8217;re on Twitter at all, right now! I&amp;#8217;ve had &lt;a href="https://octodon.social/@pzmyers"&gt;a presence on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; for a long while now, and it&amp;#8217;s good, in a lot of ways better, than the bird site, just with less volume and fewer precious celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms of this &amp;ldquo;melancholy delirium&amp;rdquo; might include fever, disturbed sleep, palpitations, loss of appetite and anxiety. The Germans had a word for it: &lt;em&gt;heimweh&lt;/em&gt; or &amp;ldquo;home-woe&amp;rdquo;. But Hofer coined a new medical term from the Greek &lt;em&gt;nostos&lt;/em&gt;, meaning a homecoming, and &lt;em&gt;algos&lt;/em&gt;, denoting pain. He called it nostalgia: an unassuageable grief for a lost homeland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;The meaning of nostalgia may have changed, but two original and remarkable new books explore how Hofer&amp;rsquo;s insight might resonate today in an age of mass migration and resurgent nationalism. Both dig deep into difficult questions around identity and belonging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exiles: Three Island Journeys&lt;/em&gt; by William Atkins takes as its starting point the lives of three late 19th-century political exiles, each a figure of resistance and change. The French CommunardLouise Michel was transported to the Pacific island of New Caledonia. Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, a Zulu king, was exiled by the British to St Helena in the South Atlantic. And the Jewish Ukrainian revolutionary Lev Shternberg was sent to Sakhalin Island, off the coast of Siberia, by Tsarist Russia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Atkins&amp;rsquo; primary interest is in how his subjects adapted to these ruptures in their lives. &amp;ldquo;The thought of the distance kills us,&amp;rdquo; one of Michel&amp;rsquo;s fellow Communard exiles said. In later life, Shternberg taught ethnography in St Petersburg. His students described him as a man &amp;ldquo;charred by some internal burning&amp;rdquo;. Another exiled Communard &amp;ldquo;died of grief at receiving no news from home&amp;rdquo;. To be so unmoored was a kind of death-in-life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;But you couldn&amp;rsquo;t go back, even when you did, in fact, go back. For Dinuzulu, who adopted European clothing and manners during his eight years on St Helena, this was literally true. The defeated kingdom he left behind was broken up by the British, and he returned no longer a king, but as the governor of what was essentially a vassal territory, fractured by conflict and imperial taxation. And yet the land and its people were the source of his identity: &amp;ldquo;the closer to his land he was allowed to be, the more powerful he grew,&amp;rdquo; Atkins writes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Atkins visited the places he writes about. He searches for the traces his subjects left on the spaces they inhabited. But he is also exploring other kinds of exile and fracture, in particular the legacies of empire on these island prisons: the traumas that exiles and subject peoples might share. The indigenous Kanak of New Caledonia are still struggling today to free their country from French dominion. Atkins&amp;rsquo; arrival coincides with a fractious independence vote, which the Kanak lost. He quotes the Kanak &lt;br /&gt;independence campaigner Jean-Marie Tjibaou: &amp;ldquo;The hardest thing is to stay alive and feel like a stranger in your own land.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;***&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Imperial Europe transported immense numbers to its penal colonies. The British empire dispatched some 376,000, Tsarist Russia nearly two million. &lt;em&gt;Exiles&lt;/em&gt;, then, is an intimate account of an epic phenomenon. Amaryllis Gacioppo&amp;rsquo;s concern in &lt;em&gt;Motherlands: In Search of Our Inherited Cities &lt;/em&gt;is more directly personal. Her starting point is the legacy of four generations of matrilineal migration within her family &amp;ndash; in the 1920s from Turin to Benghazi, then part of Italian colonial Libya; from Benghazi to Palermo by way of Rome in the 1940s; from Palermo to the Sydney suburbs two decades later; and, for Gacioppo herself, a recent move from Australia, her place of birth, to Italy, a country that has both always and never been home to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;As Gacioppo traces these stories of displacement from city to city she explores wider ideas about dislocation and belonging. She recreates daily familial journeys and routines, trying to &amp;ldquo;trigger a kind of temporal magic . . . [accessing] powers of memory or meaning or association&amp;rdquo;. She is particularly interested in photographs and maps. A map of Allied bomb damage to Rome pales before the reality of a satellite photograph; but in colonial Benghazi it is the great-grandparents&amp;rsquo; photos that seem unreal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Turin, Nietzsche said, is &amp;ldquo;the first place where I am possible&amp;rdquo;. If the goal of all migration is to find such a place, what of countries that make migrant lives impossible? In Rome, Gacioppo meets a woman campaigning for the rights of 1.5 million young Italians without citizenship, many of whom arrived in their infancy. They call themselves &amp;ldquo;ghosts by law&amp;rdquo;, denied a connection to their homeland&amp;rsquo;s past, along with the certainty of a settled future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Gacioppo writes eloquently about the alienating dislocation of the &lt;em&gt;unheimlich&lt;/em&gt; (literally, the unhomely) &amp;ndash; what she calls &amp;ldquo;a dispersal of the self, a confused state of inner unmooring&amp;rdquo;. At the other end of the extreme, she visits the former SS headquarters in Rome, now a museum. In the cells, scratched into the walls, are the messages of the soon-to-be-tortured, soon-to-be-dead. &amp;ldquo;Love Italy&amp;rdquo;, one reads. &amp;ldquo;Those who die for the homeland live for eternity&amp;rdquo;, reads another. What is this idea of home, of place, that &lt;br /&gt;belonging to it is more powerful than death?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Mobility &amp;ndash; migration, exile, colonisation &amp;ndash; has always been part of the human condition. And the most meaningful kinds of belonging have nothing to do with borders or governments. &amp;ldquo;[A] relationship to the land as a basis of cultural identity is one that echoes the beliefs and religions of native peoples all over the world,&amp;rdquo; Gacioppo writes. But roots can also regrow. When Louise Michel returned to France from exile, she smuggled five cats out with her. They were, she said, &amp;ldquo;something alive left from home&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Both of these complex, thoughtful and deeply moving books also look towards the larger idea that, as Gacioppo writes, &amp;ldquo;With each step forward into the future, something is lost, and this loss, the void created by it, travels with us. It is there to remind us that there is no such thing as returning.&amp;rdquo; That is, the griefs of time, of separation, of mortality are another exile from which there is no return. If a true homecoming is impossible and this greater kind of exile haunts us all, who amongst us remains unbroken?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Pastafarians gather for a &amp;ldquo;stand-in&amp;rdquo; in Turin, 2015" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2EX5WMW.jpg" height="1000" alt="Pastafarians gather for a &amp;ldquo;stand-in&amp;rdquo; in Turin in 2015" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;One day in 2016, Derk Venema, a Dutch academic specialising in legal philosophy, was browsing the internet for examples of &amp;ldquo;philosophically interesting questions about religious freedom&amp;rdquo; to show his students. He came across the perfect case: a &amp;ldquo;Pastafarian&amp;rdquo;, or self-designated member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), was challenging the authorities for rejecting his driving licence photograph, in which he wore a colander on his head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Venema took a few students to watch the case before the local Chamber of Commerce. &amp;ldquo;It was one of the most hilarious things I have ever witnessed,&amp;rdquo; he says. Math&amp;eacute; Coolen, the applicant, &amp;ldquo;played his role excellently. Even the Commissioner was having a tough time not laughing.&amp;rdquo; But when he spoke to Coolen afterwards, Venema realised that he was &amp;ldquo;also very serious about the underlying questions, the questions about when and how administrative bodies get to decide what is a religion and what is not, and who gets to enjoy religious privileges and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;One of the students who accompanied Venema on his trip was Mienke de Wilde. She was so impressed by the case that she decided to become a Pastafarian herself. The next time she applied for a driving licence, she submitted a photo of herself wearing a colander. Her application was rejected. She appealed, claiming that Pastafarianism was a religion and her right to manifest it was protected under the European Convention on Human Rights. Venema took on her case and Coolen&amp;rsquo;s; ultimately, it was de Wilde&amp;rsquo;s alone that went all the way to the Dutch Administrative Court and then the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The court handed down judgment on 9 November last year. But before examining their conclusions, it is worth taking a step back to the origins of this strange &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;In 2005, the Kansas School Board was considering whether to teach the theory of intelligent design alongside evolution. Bobby Henderson, a physics graduate from Oregon, wrote a now famous letter in which he claimed to believe that a &amp;ldquo;Flying Spaghetti Monster&amp;rdquo; created the world, and demanded that his theory be given equal time with the other two. He also claimed that &amp;ldquo;global warming . . . and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Henderson had written the letter as satire. In doing so, however, he unexpectedly generated a meme. The internet was in its early days of cavalier freedom. Facebook had been founded the previous year and Twitter would be the next; chain emails were still a thing. At the same time, &amp;ldquo;New Atheism&amp;rdquo; was on the rise. Sam Harris had published &lt;em&gt;The End of Faith&lt;/em&gt; in 2004, and contributions by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and Christopher Hitchens would soon follow. (Dennett later featured in the FSM documentary &lt;em&gt;I, Pastafari.&lt;/em&gt;) It was fashionable among the godless youth to put &amp;ldquo;Jedi&amp;rdquo; as their religion on the UK census; 176,632 people did so in 2011. Parody was the flavour of the day. Pastafarianism went viral, and publishers rushed to sign Henderson up for a book contract.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The result was &lt;em&gt;The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/em&gt;, published by Villard less than six months before Dawkins&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;. The&lt;em&gt; Gospel&lt;/em&gt; according to Henderson is a picaresque series of pseudo-scientific rants, accompanied by diagrams and mock-formal logic, on topics from &amp;ldquo;the need for alternative theories&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;a history of heretics&amp;rdquo;. It is clearly designed to parody the attempts of evangelical Christians to co-opt science into supporting their literalist interpretation of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As a work of literature or philosophy, the &lt;em&gt;Gospel&lt;/em&gt; has its limitations. In the words of Kathleen McEvoy, an Australian judge: &amp;ldquo;At best the texts present ordinary moral admonitions and mundane articulations of principles of conduct present in the texts of most other established religions.&amp;rdquo; Henderson himself, drawing a comparison with traditional scriptures, wrote that &amp;ldquo;this book will stand up to any of the others &amp;ndash; at least in terms of strict plausibility if not literary finesse and retributive beheadings and disembowelments.&amp;rdquo; The book reportedly sold over 100,000 copies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Meanwhile, the memes of Pastafarianism have multiplied. A crucial moment in the Church&amp;rsquo;s history came in 2011 in Austria, when Niko Alm was permitted to wear a colander in his driving licence photo &amp;ndash; although only after a visit from a public health officer to check that he was sane. The police, who issued the licence, stated that &amp;ldquo;the photo was not approved on religious grounds. The only criterion for photos in driving licence applications is that the whole face must be visible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;This deftly sidestepped the underlying issue &amp;ndash; but Alm&amp;rsquo;s success led to a string of similar attempts around the world, including de Wilde&amp;rsquo;s. Different authorities have responded in their own ways. In some places, often the more religious ones, the colander has been permitted, from the Czech Republic to Utah; in Poland, the Church of the FSM has been allowed to register as an official religion. In Belgium and Ireland, the colander has not made it through. In England in 2015, the DVLA rejected a colander photo by Ian Harris, described by the &lt;em&gt;Mail Online &lt;/em&gt;as &amp;ldquo;an eccentric man&amp;rdquo;, because headgear was only &amp;ldquo;permissible on religious or medical grounds&amp;rdquo;. In Adelaide, Australia, Guy Albon had his guns confiscated after he submitted a colander photo for his licence, out of fears for his &amp;ldquo;mental competency&amp;rdquo;. More seriously, the Pastafarian Mikhail Iosilevich was issued his licence in Russia &amp;ndash; but was later arrested on the political charge of &amp;ldquo;cooperating with an undesirable organisation&amp;rdquo;. In May, he was sentenced to 20 months in prison and ordered to pay civil damages roughly equivalent to &amp;pound;1500.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Is Pastafarianism a religion?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Wearing the colander can be interpreted as a protest against the legal exemptions and privileges readily granted to adherents of all the major world religions. The Dutch authorities, like the DVLA, would have permitted a turban, skull cap or nun&amp;rsquo;s veil in ID photos as long as the face remained clear. De Wilde&amp;rsquo;s case is the first and, so far, the only time that the European Court has considered whether Pastafarianism is a &amp;ldquo;religion or belief&amp;rdquo; worthy of protection in human rights law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The result of de Wilde&amp;rsquo;s challenge, however, was the same in both Holland and Strasbourg: rejection. On the evidence, the Dutch courts found, and the European judges accepted, that she genuinely did wear a colander at all times when outside. (A black plastic colander which she likens to a &amp;ldquo;bowler hat&amp;rdquo; and wears at a rakish angle; she has a different one for cooking pasta.) But they could not accept that her beliefs constituted a &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;De Wilde argued that her beliefs were protected under Article 9 of the Convention on Human Rights, which states that, subject to various limitations:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;A regional court refused de Wilde&amp;rsquo;s appeal on the grounds that wearing the colander was not mandatory in Pastafarianism. This argument was rejected on further appeal by the Administrative Jurisdiction of the Council of State, Holland&amp;rsquo;s highest appeal court, because the case law of the ECtHR had previously held that the manifestation of a religion does not have to be mandatory to be protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Instead, both the Administrative Court and the ECtHR rejected the claim that Pastafarianism could amount to a religion. Consequently, however much de Wilde wore her colander, it did not count as a religious act. The thorny path by which they reached this conclusion reveals the difficulties that arise when courts of law are asked to decide metaphysical questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you read an anthology on the concept of religion, you get hundreds of different definitions,&amp;rdquo; says Paul Cliteur, Emeritus Professor of Jurisprudence at Leiden University. These go back to Cicero in the first century BC, who defined religion as &amp;ldquo;reverence for the gods&amp;rdquo;. It is unsurprising, Cliteur argues, that &amp;ldquo;a bunch of judges assembled in the European Court&amp;rdquo; should find it a tough nut to crack: &amp;ldquo;they are not religious scholars, they are not philosophers, they are not involved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Through its case law, the ECtHR has developed a test for &amp;ldquo;religion or belief&amp;rdquo; under Article 9: to qualify, the relevant belief must have obtained &amp;ldquo;a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance&amp;rdquo;. In de Wilde&amp;rsquo;s case, the judges quoted the reasoning of the Dutch Administrative Court, and then briefly reiterated it, to conclude that Pastafarianism failed to meet the requisite standards of &amp;ldquo;seriousness and cohesion&amp;rdquo;. The movement was designed to &amp;ldquo;parody&amp;rdquo; established religions in order to criticise the &amp;ldquo;influence and privileged position afforded to [them] . . . in some contemporary societies&amp;rdquo;; as such, it could not be a religion itself. Or, as the Dutch court put it, the &amp;ldquo;satirical element&amp;rdquo; was &amp;ldquo;so dominant&amp;rdquo; that the European Court&amp;rsquo;s test could not be met.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In the court&amp;rsquo;s view, Pastafarianism was not serious; examples were drawn from Henderson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Gospel&lt;/em&gt;, including his &amp;ldquo;Eight I&amp;rsquo;d Really Rather You Didn&amp;rsquo;ts&amp;rdquo;, which parodied the Ten Commandments. Nor was it sufficiently cohesive; the court took as its example the pirates-and-global-warming theory. The court was equally dismissive of de Wilde&amp;rsquo;s argument that her own &amp;ldquo;individual version&amp;rdquo; of Pastafarianism could be serious and cohesive, even if the movement as a whole was not; her explanations, it held, were too &amp;ldquo;general and abstract&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;There is clearly force in the view that a humorous parody of something cannot itself be that thing. If the law is required to define concepts like &amp;ldquo;religion or belief&amp;rdquo;, then there must be limiting cases. Henderson&amp;rsquo;s monster started as a sarcastic attack on the teaching of creationism. Its claims are outrageous and entirely unbelievable: that is the point. Wearing a colander or a pirate hat for an ID photo is ridiculous. The purpose of doing so is to question the idea that some forms of headgear are allowed, but not others, on the basis of unprovable dogma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Freedom of religion, or freedom of thought?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Yet there are difficulties with the courts&amp;rsquo; reasoning if Pastafarianism is compared with other belief systems &amp;ndash; and, like all parody, it is designed to be compared. Seriousness, for one, is not as straightforward a criterion as it appears. Take Mormonism, says Venema: it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;hilarious&amp;rdquo;. Indeed, to non-believers, the Book of Mormon reads like a parody of the Bible. If Pastafarianism is zany, it reflects the zaniness of established religions. As Henderson writes, &amp;ldquo;every time an &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; ruling is made against our Church it illustrates how absurd the whole idea is of the state defining what is a legitimate religious organisation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The European Court&amp;rsquo;s reasoning also betrays the extent to which, in judicial considerations of Article 9, the paradigm case is religion, and other beliefs are only extensions of that. The court concluded that Pastafarianism &amp;ldquo;seeks the same privileges for itself [as for established religions] with a view to propagating its message.&amp;rdquo; That is what it would do if it were a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; religion, or a sham religion trying to gain money from its supporters. Yet De Wilde told me that she would be happy to remove the colander for her ID photo, as long as others did. &amp;ldquo;We just want to be treated equally.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;There are many undercurrents in the Dutch courts&amp;rsquo; resistance to Pastafarianism. One, argues Venema, is the civil servant&amp;rsquo;s instinctive fear of mockery. &amp;ldquo;We even discovered that there was a lot of communication by city administrations with the Ministry for the Interior. They were advised to deny all these applications by people who wore spaghetti strainers on their heads.&amp;rdquo; As a result of this and the Dutch judgments, says de Wilde, the authorities have effectively discouraged any more Pastafarians from applying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;A similar attitude was evinced by a Qu&amp;eacute;b&amp;eacute;cois judge in another Pastafarian case in 2015. In the judge&amp;rsquo;s view, the applicant, Isabelle Narayana, who wanted to wear a pirate hat in her ID photo, was treating &amp;ldquo;in a banal manner the fundamental rights and liberties protected by the [Canadian human rights] charters, to the point of rendering them insignificant.&amp;rdquo; He said her claim was &amp;ldquo;an immense farce that aims to mock religions&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Tanya Watkins, self-appointed Captain of the Church of the FSM in Australia, met with similar treatment when she applied to register it as a religious organisation. The judge, Kathleen McEvoy, considered that the scriptures of Pastafarianism were &amp;ldquo;parodic texts, developed and expressed for the purpose of mocking and satirising established religions, holding them up to ridicule and suggesting they are worthless and meaningless&amp;rdquo;. She even lambasted them for being &amp;ldquo;racist&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;sexist&amp;rdquo; and likely to be &amp;ldquo;offensive or insulting&amp;rdquo; to (real) religions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The implication of such judgments is that there is something nefarious about mocking religions in this way &amp;ndash; perhaps due to a sense, in secular countries like Australia, the Netherlands and the UK, that protecting religious exceptionalism is a way of protecting minorities. Yet it is a sad state of affairs when the courts shrink from engaging with the question at the heart of the matter: whether the starting point in human rights law should be religion &amp;ndash; cogent, serious and important &amp;ndash; or whether it should be the freedom to think, believe or withhold belief, and act. If the latter (the secular starting-point), then there would be no need for courts to build a hierarchy of beliefs, or to stop Pastafarians from wearing colanders because they were not serious enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;For de Wilde, the point of fighting her case, and being deprived of a driving licence for five years in the process, is to achieve &amp;ldquo;equality&amp;rdquo;. In her view, Pastafarianism is &amp;ldquo;not less real than other religions&amp;rdquo;. Watkins agrees: &amp;ldquo;it has all of the same elements any other religion has,&amp;rdquo; and the same inconsistency in its followers&amp;rsquo; interpretations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Depending on your perspective, Pastafarians are either the most undogmatic believers in history, or unbelievers who will go to extreme lengths to protest against religious exceptionalism. &amp;ldquo;In a certain sense,&amp;rdquo; says Cliteur, &amp;ldquo;and I speak as an atheist, Pastafarianism is the ideal religion. If all humanity were Pastafarians &amp;ndash; people with a sense of humour and a relaxed attitude towards their religious convictions &amp;ndash; that would be a tremendous improvement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Venema, despite his devotion to the Pastafarian cause, has not become an adherent. &amp;ldquo;I have never considered joining any groups or organisations that are founded on a specific idea,&amp;rdquo; he explains. &amp;ldquo;As a philosopher, I want to be free to think and express anything I want . . . Which I could still do as a Pastafarian, of course.&amp;rdquo; There you have it: a religion with no requirements, which is still too restrictive for a freethinking philosopher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Perhaps it is also a question of taste, and of the symbols people use to express themselves; colanders and cutlasses are not everyone&amp;rsquo;s cup of tea. Not that Pastafarians are required to wear them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The pull of our ancient ancestors</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6030/the-pull-of-our-ancient-ancestors#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="The Nine Ladies stone circle, Stanton Moor " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Nine_Ladies_stone_circle,_Stanton_Moor_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2360408.jpg" height="631" alt="The Nine Ladies of Stanton Moor" width="946" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Stanton Moor is situated in Derbyshire&amp;rsquo;s beautiful Peak District National Park, in the heart of England. At first glance up here, it&amp;rsquo;s all foxgloves, purple heather and wildflowers. But if you have an archaeologist&amp;rsquo;s eye, like my friend Ian Jackson, you can detect something more deliberately patterned in the rocky formations that stretch out to the horizon in every direction: the outline of a Bronze Age roundhouse, sunken into the rock-strewn moor. The walls are long fallen and weathered away. Ian pointed out the narrow path that leads downwards and suddenly I saw it too. I stepped into the entrance and back through time. I was in someone&amp;rsquo;s home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re closer to the Bronze Age people than they were to those who built Stonehenge,&amp;rdquo; Ian observed. For a moment I was struck silent with the majesty of that timescale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;I had come Bronze Age hunting because, like many people it seems, I have recently become fascinated with the pre-Roman peoples of the British Isle. My walk was partly prompted by the British Museum&amp;rsquo;s blockbuster early summer exhibition on Stonehenge, the Neolithic stone circle in Wiltshire. Such stone circles pepper the length and breadth of this island nation. Not far from Stanton Moor is Arbor Low, another Neolithic stone circle at which the stones are now flat on the ground. Historians believe they were deliberately knocked down by medieval people, fuelled by their own superstitions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Stonehenge is a monument that Brits tend to think of as archetypically British. But the exhibition confounded all expectations. A wall mounted with dozens of beautiful stone axe heads from all over Europe revealed, post-Brexit, an almost provocatively counterintuitive picture; Britain connected by a large land bridge to northern Europe, with Stonehenge as the trading and pilgrimage heart of a borderless world. Recent excavations have provided plentiful evidence of trade from further afield &amp;ndash; pottery, jewellery and weapons from the Middle East, North Africa and Asia Minor. More intriguing still were the mysterious carvings of flowing spirals and cups and rings, on giant rocks and boulders found across Europe, from Germany to Scotland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The British Museum show was fascinating &amp;ndash; but there were some troubling aspects too. The exhibition included skeletons that had been unearthed in graves. One was the skeleton of a woman who was still clutching the outline of her dead baby, a bag of more than a hundred animal teeth buried with them as a spiritual offering. After more than a century of challenge, museums would not, I think, dare to display the human remains of ancient First Nation peoples this way. On the one hand, modern Europeans claim a kinship with these ancient brothers and sisters, and yet we tolerate what could be seen as the desecration of their graves. With their belief systems long lost, they have no one to advocate for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;And yet there is an honest spiritual craving in our modern behaviour around ancient monuments. Stonehenge is now understood to have been built in line with the natural cycle of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation around the Sun, aligning with sunrise during the solstices. Humanists surely recognise the pull of acknowledging our place in the beautiful but indifferent Solar System.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Iwitnessed this pull in action on that day before the summer solstice when Ian and I walked on Stanton Moor. Not far from where Ian pointed out the outline of ancient homes is a Bronze Age stone circle known as the Nine Ladies. Around it, a tent city had grown up, of young families as much as old hippies, wanting to be part of something bigger than themselves. Such gatherings have been happening all over the country at stone circles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Part of it, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, is that after all the Covid lockdowns, we are still cherishing our right to roam freely and be with others. But there seems to be something else we are craving. It may seem that we know very little about our ancient ancestors. We don&amp;rsquo;t have a good idea of how they looked, and even their bones have mostly vanished. But they have left the most tantalising glimpses: jewellery made of black obsidian; gold torques of such weight and braided beauty it&amp;rsquo;s dazzling to imagine them worn in ritual acts. It&amp;rsquo;s also pleasing to discover that some of the finds in the Stonehenge exhibition suggest women may well have held positions of power in these societies, as shamans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;These were humans living on a minute timescale compared to the weathered rocks of their monuments. Yet their mystery binds them to us. We are drawn to the idea of their transience &amp;ndash; for what did the pandemic do more to reveal than the fragility of our own lives?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Work Pray Code</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6029/book-review-work-pray-code#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Buddhist monks at Facebook&amp;rsquo;s headquarters" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/buddhafacebook.jpeg" height="1010" alt="Buddhist monks at Facebook" width="1596" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Pray Code (Princeton University Press) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;by Carolyn Chen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;What happens to us, and what happens to religion, when people worship work?&amp;rdquo; This is the question that occupies sociologist Carolyn Chen in &lt;em&gt;Work Pray Code&lt;/em&gt;, her new book based on in-depth research on Silicon Valley&amp;rsquo;s tech industry. Her answer reveals the book&amp;rsquo;s title (with its suggestion of bounded activities) to be a slight misnomer. For, as Chen discovers, work is not only &amp;ldquo;replacing religion&amp;rdquo; (increasingly omnipresent in employees&amp;rsquo; lives, and the object of faith and devotion); it is infused with spiritual and religious practices geared, ultimately, towards maximum productivity. This is a world where work is not so much distinct from prayer as blurred with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Chen suggests that Silicon Valley &amp;ndash; ostensibly one of America&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;least religious&amp;rdquo; places &amp;ndash; is not so &amp;ldquo;godless&amp;rdquo; after all. The tech workplace is &amp;ldquo;conscripting&amp;rdquo; religion; borrowing (typically, but not exclusively) from Asian spiritual and religious traditions, such as yoga and meditation, to help employees to become &amp;ldquo;whole&amp;rdquo; and connect to their &amp;ldquo;authentic selves&amp;rdquo;. But the nurturing care and cultivation of employees&amp;rsquo; spiritual lives are not altruistic. Rather, they rest upon the logic that the &amp;ldquo;self-alienated&amp;rdquo; worker operates at sub-optimal capacity. They are also vulnerable to burnout, which is blamed not on overwork, but &amp;ldquo;insufficient self-care&amp;rdquo;. No wonder, then, that employees might seek &amp;ldquo;optimisation&amp;rdquo; through practices including meditation, journaling and even fasting. Chen quotes one CEO who asks his staff to anonymously rate, weekly, aspects of their lives including spirituality. &amp;ldquo;Everyone knows&amp;rdquo;, he explains, &amp;ldquo;that if you&amp;rsquo;re not taking care of yourself, you&amp;rsquo;re not playing for the team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Chen describes the &amp;ldquo;meditation entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; including mindfulness teachers, HR executives and the coaches allocated to high-potential staff &amp;ndash; who share the challenge of selling &amp;ldquo;a religious product in a professedly secular workplace&amp;rdquo;. In doing so, they renounce a &amp;ldquo;sacred, separate, Asian, otherworldly, and ethical religious Buddhism&amp;rdquo;, and replace it with one that is &amp;ldquo;universalised, Whitened, scientised, profitable, and efficient&amp;rdquo;. Meditation thus becomes a snackable &amp;ldquo;skill&amp;rdquo; used to aid creativity, flow and focus (alongside empathy, with a view to enabling more &amp;ldquo;user friendly&amp;rdquo; design). Indeed, the practices Chen describes seem so far from actual Buddhism that one wonders whether they can be analysed in terms of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; at all. Chen explains: &amp;ldquo;tech meditators&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo;, but use &amp;ldquo;religious traditions &amp;ndash; their practices, rituals, and teachings &amp;ndash; as tools or technologies to optimise their work performance&amp;rdquo;, directed towards the &amp;ldquo;religion of work&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Though wonderfully rich in detail, &lt;em&gt;Work Pray Code&lt;/em&gt; is frustrated by its failure to provide, early on, a firm working definition of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo;. This is clarified in an appendix, where Chen suggests that religion &amp;ldquo;in a secular age&amp;rdquo; can be studied not only through &amp;ldquo;religious things&amp;rdquo;, but those things that are also &amp;ldquo;sacred&amp;rdquo; to us and command worship (e.g. work, worshipped through yoga). Still, it leads one to wonder where &amp;ldquo;spirituality&amp;rdquo; ends and &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and, indeed, cultishness &amp;ndash; begins. Some readers may find Chen&amp;rsquo;s conclusion conservative: though critical of the extent to which work is worshipped, Chen does not challenge work itself; likewise, she criticises &amp;ldquo;religions&amp;rdquo; for not confronting work worship, but leaves religion per se untouched. She suggests, &amp;ldquo;Religious traditions can offer a powerful and distinct set of ethics, communities, and rituals to counter the morally bereft religion of work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Still, Chen&amp;rsquo;s critique of Silicon Valley&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Techtopia&amp;rdquo; and its impact on the wider social fabric is powerful. She describes how participatory democracy &amp;ndash; indeed, the common good &amp;ndash; suffers when we worship work and disengage from civic life; how public goods become private &amp;ldquo;perks&amp;rdquo; when the tech industry dominates; how so-called &amp;ldquo;wholeness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the basic stuff of a good life&amp;rdquo; has become the &amp;ldquo;privilege&amp;rdquo; of the highly skilled, while others lack even basic security. Silicon Valley is, she suggests, a bellwether. One need not agree with Chen&amp;rsquo;s framework of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; to see that we must pay attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Time for a new renaissance?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6034/time-for-a-new-renaissance#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;img title="HowTheLightGetsIn festival aims to bring disciplines together, particularly philosophers and scientists" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/highres_84_6896-1-_1_.jpg" height="1278" alt="HowTheLightGetsIn London" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;You know the feeling. You pass the window of a book store, or switch on a political talk show, and are overwhelmed by an irritating sensation of deja vu. Haven&amp;rsquo;t you heard these ideas before? Behind the shiny new designs, aren&amp;rsquo;t these latest non-fiction hardbacks peddling the same basic theories, tweaked to entice a fresh audience? It can be difficult to gauge how our own personal frustration relates to the broader reality. On Sunday, HowTheLightGetsIn London confronted this perception head on. HTLGI is a festival dedicated to "big ideas", bringing together academics, scientists, creatives and "thought leaders" of all stripes. They have more than a vested interest, therefore, in answering the question. Is our intellectual climate in Britain stagnating? If so, how do we encourage new and original thinking?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The event brought together speakers from the diverse fields of philosophy, theoretical physics and journalism to chew over the dilemma. While the term &amp;ldquo;Renaissance Man&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t pass the lips of any of the speakers (although they might have updated it to &amp;ldquo;Renaissance person&amp;rdquo;), the figure of the free-thinking polymath was a definite spectre in the room. John Ellis, the renowned theoretical particle physicist, called for a more meaningful exchange of ideas and collaboration between disciplines. He pointed out that the experimental techniques he uses to test his ideas within the field of fundamental physics could fruitfully be applied to climate science. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible, he said, to get small pots of money for this kind of work, securing funding for such projects in the longer term is disappointingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;"Interdisciplinarity" is a term that is readily bandied about these days, but as the philosopher Sophie Scott-Brown remarked, we "need to pay more attention to what it actually means." She said this could be anything from bringing academics from different departments together to &amp;ldquo;sit around the same table&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;melting down the barriers&amp;rdquo; between disciplines. She is strongly in favour of the latter, envisioning a transformative shift towards a more creative, &amp;ldquo;inquiry-led&amp;rdquo; approach. Taking up John Ellis&amp;rsquo; point, dynamic and complex problems like the climate crisis, or the future of global security, could be tackled with the inventiveness required through putting more emphasis on bringing people together on the basis of what knowledge and skills they might bring to the challenge, whatever their field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But this isn't only a question of transforming our approach to learning and research. The trend towards specialisation is tightly linked today with the pressure on universities to adopt business practices and become increasingly self-sufficient, in the light of severe government cuts. The incentive to meet targets, the pressure to secure funding, and the fierce competition for students all serve to create an environment in which, in Scott-Brown's words, ideas are pumped out as "products". Meanwhile, the kind of open-ended inquiry that so often produces new discoveries is hampered by the need to justify the research in advance. &amp;ldquo;Most of my colleagues have to be 99 per cent sure about what they&amp;rsquo;re writing before putting forward a funding application.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;It's interesting that the most concrete idea came from the non-academic on the panel. The journalist David Aaronovitch made an impassioned plea to &amp;ldquo;abolish the A-level&amp;rdquo;, arguing that this would change the culture of learning that runs from school into universities. He claimed that every single British government had done a report on the A-level and found it to be wanting, but that there was a stubborn belief that specialisation is what makes the English system exceptional. He advocated switching to the International Baccalaureate (IB). The United States has the largest number of IB programmes, in both private and state schools, and he suggested that we take some lessons from the American approach, where university degrees are also four years, instead of three, and place more emphasis on students studying a wider breadth of subjects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Aaronovitch disagreed that our society is suffering from a lack of new big ideas, however. Following the two "isms" of the 20th century (communism and fascism), we now have a distrust of them which is perfectly healthy, he argued. We can see this plainly from the much more recent example of Prime Minister Truss&amp;rsquo; mini-budget, which is deeply &amp;ldquo;ideological&amp;rdquo; and has been a "failure". With big questions like how do we get to net zero, he said, "I'm happy to be more pragmatic."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Whether in pursuit of bold new theories, or working on practical solutions, there is hope when it comes to bringing people together. John Ellis praised the inclusion of more women and people of colour in the research community, and the way in which technology was creating a more level playing field when it came to participating in scientific debate. &amp;ldquo;And here I am,&amp;rdquo; he joked, &amp;ldquo;in a philosophy debate, while two other debates are going on about my own field of science.&amp;rdquo; HowTheLightGetsIn is one of the spaces where philosophers and scientists in particular benefit from coming together. &amp;ldquo;This is us forming the new society,&amp;rdquo; Scott-Brown said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But the festival happens twice a year, a drop in the ocean. For the spirit of a New Renaissance to take hold, changes would be needed on many levels: cultural, political and economic. It's certain that we need creativity and invention in order to meet the confluence of crises facing Britain today. While our current Prime Minister may indeed have outlined a consistent ideological position, her ideas are explicitly rooted in Thatcherism. It seems likely that a failure to generate new big ideas appropriate to the particular challenges Britain faces today will only lead to a dangerous re-hashing of the old. We know that our intellectual climate is fed by many sources, but the health of the academy, along with our education system as a whole, is surely the bedrock of the edifice. Interdisciplinarity will be key to renewal, but any transformation will need to start by treating universities not as businesses within the higher education market, but as spaces of learning, sharing and discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More details on HowTheLightGetsIn, the world's largest ideas and music festival, can be found &lt;a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/london"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those of you who couldn't be with us in person, all the debates and talks from the festival will gradually be released online in the coming months on the Institute of Art and Ideas online platform, &lt;a href="https://iai.tv/?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;amp;utm_campaign=London2022&amp;amp;utm_id=Partner"&gt;IAI.TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change.

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
