<p class="lead">I was 13 when I got my first job. It was hard labor for the City of Kent Parks Department. I’d go out with the crew and we’d rake and shovel to remove rocks from new parks under development.</p>
<p>I lasted two weeks. I was shoveling rocks from piles up into a dump truck, hoisting heavy shovel loads above my head to clear the sides of the truck bed, when my left knee buckled and my kneecap was dislocated. There went that summer! I spent the entire season in a hip-to-ankle cast, and got $170 dollars in disability pay. My knee was permanently wrecked, unfortunately — it would dislocate in a grisly fashion in 10th grade, as well, and is permanently weakened. I can feel it even now, especially when I go up and down stairs.</p>
<p>$170 is a lot of money when you’re 13. It got spent on clothes for school in the Fall — I was outgrowing everything — and I don’t think it was worth it.</p>
<p>Well looky here. Businesses are feeling a labor shortage, so they’re looking around for muscled meat to do repetitive and dangerous labor, and who do they spy? Kids. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/02/11/child-labor-iowa/">Let’s put the kids to work!</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Legislators in Iowa and Minnesota introduced bills in January to loosen child labor law regulations around age and workplace safety protections in some of the country’s most dangerous workplaces. Minnesota’s bill would permit 16- and 17-year-olds to work construction jobs. The Iowa measure would allow 14- and 15-year-olds to work certain jobs in meatpacking plants.</p>
<p>The Iowa bill, introduced by state Sen. Jason Schultz (R), would permit children as young as 14 to work in industrial freezers and meat coolers, provided they are separate from where meat is prepared, and work in industrial laundry.</p>
<p>At 15, they would be able to work as lifeguards and swimming instructors, perform light assembly-line work after obtaining a waiver from state officials, and load and unload up to 50 pounds of products from vehicles and store shelves with a waiver “depending on the strength and ability of the fifteen-year-old.”</p>
<p>The Iowa proposal would also expand hours teenagers can work during the school year, and would shield businesses from civil liability if a youth worker is sickened, injured or killed on the job.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even in the benighted 1970s we weren’t allowed to work construction or in meatpacking plants (although the bit about moving around 50 pound loads did trigger a twinge — repetitive heavy lifting can do a surprising amount of damage to growing bodies). Just think, I could have had my horizons broadened with hard labor pushing around dead pigs on meathooks! I was going to comment on the riches I might have received if I’d accidentally sawed off a limb, but the politicians are thinking ahead and protecting businesses from liability already.</p>
<p>Jesus fuck, but capitalism is evil.</p>

<p class="lead">Never trust a politician who wears a big-ass cowboy hat indoors. That means I’m not a fan of the Wyoming Republican party.</p>
<p>More sensible Wyoming politicians are <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/02/10/wyoming-republican-party-blasts-child-marriage-law-says-younger-teens-should-be-able-to-marry/">proposing a bill that disallows marriage to 15 year old and younger children</a>. The Republicans are agin’ it. Their reasoning is that, welp, kids can get pregnant.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>The key issue, the analysis states, is that children ages 15 and younger still can get pregnant but could no longer get married legally if the law passes.</p>
<p>This denies the right of the teen’s baby to be raised in a stable home by his or her mother and father, the document says, citing the state Constitution’s promise of equal protection as a basis.  </p>
<p>“Parents, by virtue of their right to conceive children, have the pre-political, i.e. God-given, responsibility to raise their own children,” the document continues. “This right and responsibility includes guiding their own maturing children into the estate of Holy Matrimony.” </p></blockquote>
<p>So “god-given” biology means that they have a right to lock children into a legal and political relationship and commit them to life as a parent. If a 13 year old gets pregnant, do they have the maturity to guide their own maturing children?</p>
<p>Proponents of the law have a clear response.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You don’t want a 30-year-old who impregnates a 12-year-old to be able to marry them and get around all of our other child protection laws,” he said. “I find that argument disingenuous.”  </p></blockquote>
<p>It apparently isn’t enough for the Republicans that the law still allows them to impregnate and marry 16 year olds.</p>

<p class="lead">I was chatting with <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/reprobate/">HJ Hornbeck</a> and <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/geekyhumanist/">Dr Sarah</a> yesterday, and we were tinkering with ChatGPT. We asked it for some simple medical advice, of the sort you might consult WebMD for, and Dr Sarah confirmed that it was close to what she would recommend. Then we asked it a simple question of the sort I might throw out in a college classroom.</p>
<p>We asked, “<strong>What is junk DNA?</strong>” Uh-oh.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Junk DNA is a term used to describe the non-coding regions of the genome, which do not encode proteins. For many years, it was believed that these regions of the genome had no function and were simply “leftover” DNA that accumulated over evolutionary time. This led to the term “junk DNA” being used to describe these regions, as they were thought to be of no consequence to the organism.</p>
<p>However, more recent research has shown that many of these non-coding regions actually play important roles in regulating gene expression and controlling the activity of specific genes. They can act as molecular “switches” that turn genes on or off in response to different environmental signals, and they can also act as spacers that help to organize the genome into distinct functional regions.</p>
<p>In addition, some non-coding regions of the genome contain functional elements such as transposable elements, ribosomal DNA, and small RNA molecules, which play important roles in regulating gene expression and controlling the activity of specific genes.</p>
<p>In light of these findings, the term “junk DNA” is no longer used in a scientifically accurate context, and has been largely replaced by the more accurate terms “non-coding DNA” or “regulatory DNA.” These non-coding regions of the genome are now recognized as playing important roles in shaping the phenotype and evolution of organisms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Holy crap, that is a <em>terrible</em> answer, from the very first sentence. It conflates junk DNA with non-coding DNA, and builds its entire argument on that premise. It then claims that the discovery of regulatory sequences undermined the concept…but regulatory sequences have never been regarded as junk, and neither have ribosomal DNA or these unspecified “small RNA molecules” (what? like tRNA or siRNA?) And now transposable elements are just assumed to be functional? Some have acquired functional roles, but most are not, which is kind of significant given that they make up around half the mammalian genome.</p>
<p>Then the grand conclusion is that “junk DNA” is no longer used, and has been replaced by the terms “non-coding DNA” or “regulatory DNA.” No, it has not. Those are not the same thing at all. I note that much of the answer seems to have been cribbed from the kind of thing you get in a random Google search, which is polluted with all kinds of pseudoscience, creationist sources, and general denial that our DNA could be less than perfect. For instance, even <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-junk-dna-and-what/">Scientific American has a trash article</a> that concludes that <q>evolution is too wise to waste this valuable information</q>. Maybe ChatGPT should have exercised a little discrimination, and looked at qualified sources like Graur, and Palazzo, and Moran? Because I’d give this answer a big fat “F” and comment that apparently the author hadn’t listened in lecture or read the textbook.</p>
<p>Speaking of Moran, his long awaited book, <a href="https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2023/02/i-finished-my-book.html"><i>What’s in Your Genome?: 90% of Your Genome Is Junk</i></a>, is off to the printers, with an expected release date of 16 May. Maybe that will help ChatGPT correct its bad science. That’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3Xpz11G">a book I’m looking forward to</a>.</p>

    <title>New hope for less controversial Alzheimer’s drug</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6075/new-hope-for-less-controversial-alzheimers-drug#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;img title="Histopathology of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Histopathology_of_amyloid_plaque_in_Alzheimer_s_disease.jpeg" height="576" alt="Amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease" width="780"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In 2021 the drug Aducanumab became the first new treatment for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 20 years. But it was surrounded by serious questions over the design, analysis, efficacy and safety of the underlying trials, as well as the conduct of the FDA itself (see &lt;em&gt;New Humanist &lt;/em&gt;Autumn 2021).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Like many drugs in the pipeline, Aducanumab targets build-ups of the beta-amyloid protein, known as &amp;ldquo;plaque&amp;rdquo;, in the brain. The hypothesis is that this plaque collects between neurons and disrupts their normal function, playing a causal role in the development of AD. Whilst the theory has been the basis of decades of research, scientists remain divided over its validity. The controversy surrounding Aducanumab&amp;rsquo;s approval did little to settle the debate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Then, in late 2022, a clinical trial reported significant results in targeting the &amp;ldquo;brain plaque&amp;rdquo; so central to this hypothesis. A new compound, Lecanemab, was again approved under an accelerated procedure by the FDA. However, the results of the trial, published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, have largely been received with greater hope and confidence than the Aducanumab debacle. They appear to provide evidence for the first time of both significant reductions in plaque and, crucially, a slowing in the rate of decline in cognition by 27 per cent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;We are yet to find out who might benefit. Treatment with the drug requires two weekly transfusions and will cost over $25,000 per patient per year in the US. In the UK, medical regulators are yet to announce their timeline for considering Lecanemab (they never gave the green light to Aducanumab).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Excitement has also been muted among researchers due to concerns over adverse events. The drug has only been trialled, so far, in early-stage AD patients and some experts say it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely to help those who are further down the line. However, there is still cause for optimism. If Lecanemab is approved, it would be the first time a drug is made available to AD sufferers that targets the cause of the disease, rather than the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This article is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="'40 Days for Life' campaign outside the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) offices, London." src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Bedford_Square_anti-abortion_protestors.jpeg" height="865" alt="'40 Days for Life' outside the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) offices, London." width="1472"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The image of religious protesters outside an abortion clinic &amp;ndash; holding candles and praying, or shouting at young women while brandishing gruesome posters &amp;ndash; conjures a particular place. We think of the United States. Not everyone knows that this kind of scene also plays out in the UK. Efforts are now being made to protect British women seeking to exercise their reproductive rights. This has created a backlash from anti-abortion protestors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Buffer zones are areas outside clinics providing abortion, implemented to prevent women from being abused and harassed on their way in and out. In Northern Ireland, a bill to make it a criminal offence to protest within 150 metres of any clinic is currently passing through parliament. In December, the UK&amp;rsquo;s Supreme Court ruled that while the bill did restrict protesters&amp;rsquo; rights, these restrictions were justified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The court acknowledged that the case was &amp;ldquo;highly sensitive&amp;rdquo; but stated that the women accessing abortion services &amp;ldquo;have a reasonable expectation of being able to do so without being confronted by protest activity designed to challenge and diminish their autonomy and undermine their resolve.&amp;rdquo; It took into account that clinic staff could also be intimidated, harassed and abused. Legislation is also now passing through parliaments in England and Wales, and is being considered in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The president of the American anti-abortion campaigning group 40 Days for Life responded to the Supreme Court ruling with a video promising immediate action. This is a US-based group, but it is active in Northern Ireland and Scotland. In September 2022, the group organised a six-week &amp;ldquo;prayer vigil&amp;rdquo; targeting clinics in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee and Falkirk. It is just one of several anti-abortion groups who strongly oppose buffer zones, framing it as a free speech issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The first legally enforced buffer zone in the UK was created in 2018 in the west London area of Ealing. Soon after this, the government rejected calls for nationwide buffer zones in England and Wales. Since then, 50 clinics have been targeted by anti-abortion protesters in England and Wales, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS). But there are presently only five buffer zones in England, including in Bournemouth, where the director of anti-abortion group March for Life Isabel Vaughan-Spruce was arrested outside a clinic in December.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Clare Murphy, BPAS chief executive, said: &amp;ldquo;Anti-choice groups routinely follow women and healthcare professionals as they enter and leave clinics, display graphic banners of dismembered foetuses, and tell women that if they terminate a pregnancy, they risk breast cancer and long-term mental illness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The level of resistance and organisation from anti-abortion groups indicates that even if the new laws go through, and more buffer zones are created, this will not be the end of the fight. It&amp;rsquo;s one that we must win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This piece is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Policing the internet</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6079/policing-the-internet#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Internet_Security_Padlock_for_VPN___Online_Privacy.jpeg" height="334" alt="Internet security padlock" width="418"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to make the internet safe has been the subject of fraught debate in Britain for years. What might sound at first like a set of clear goals around the protection of children and prevention of crime quickly becomes entangled in questions around responsibility and what counts as &amp;ldquo;harmful content&amp;rdquo;. As&lt;em&gt; New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; goes to print, the Online Safety Bill is passing through the House of Lords: a piece of legislation that has become so complex and bloated that it risks sneaking through changes that threaten our privacy and freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The bill would hold tech firms accountable for carrying harmful content such as revenge pornography or child sex abuse material, or selling illegal drugs or weapons. CEOs of online platforms like Facebook or TikTok could be fined, or even jailed, for failing in their duty of care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;This all sounds like progress, particularly as the key aim is to keep children safe online. The fly in the ointment is the argument that, if tech companies are to be responsible for hosting content, they must be able to access it. This isn&amp;rsquo;t such an issue for search engines like Google, but what about messaging services? A clause in the bill has mandated that tech companies provide the ability to scan end-to-end encrypted messaging for child sex abuse material, so that it can be reported to authorities. But those concerned with privacy have raised the alarm about the risk of eroding encryption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;We all feel that the only person reading our message should be its intended recipient. Popular messaging services like WhatsApp advertise themselves on this basis &amp;ndash; but not all end-to-end encrypted services are equally secure. Clearly, putting in a backdoor is likely to weaken these protections further, and could be used well beyond its intended scope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;There is also a risk that the bill will erode freedom of expression. Worryingly, an amendment has been introduced that, in the words of culture secretary Michelle Donelan, prohibits &amp;ldquo;posting videos of people crossing the channel which shows that activity in a positive light&amp;rdquo;. This is a far cry from the original intention of the legislation. A photograph of a family in their lifejackets will not be the thing that persuades someone to flee conflict or persecution. Meanwhile, it could have a chilling effect on NGOs, and hamper the essential gathering of footage and information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The internet is a fluid and rapidly evolving space, intimately bound up with our lives.

The fourth of May is Star Wars Day, aka &amp;ldquo;May the fourth be with you&amp;rdquo;, a play on the franchise&amp;rsquo;s well-known phrase &amp;ldquo;may the Force be with you&amp;rdquo;. The Force is a mysterious entity within the Star Wars Universe that Jedi harness to give them special powers, including the ability to move and levitate objects from a distance. But apart from being the answer to the pub quiz question &amp;ldquo;What links &lt;em&gt;Star Wars, Matilda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;, telekinetic powers only exist in science fiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;And yet, we have recently mastered the art of manipulating objects without touching them. How? By using light and sound waves. When these waves bounce from the surface of an object, a little bit of the momentum of the wave is transferred to the object. This change in momentum, occurring over a short time-period, manifests as a force. And if the force is larger than any other forces acting on the object, like gravity or friction for example, then the object will move in the direction of the momentum shift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;This effect is easily achieved for tiny objects similar in size to the wavelength of the wave being used &amp;ndash; millimetres for sound and nanometers for light. Any bigger than that and the effect is a mere tickle on the surface. That is, unless you do something special to the surface that guides and concentrates the momentum shift in a particular direction so that the force becomes controllable and significant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;A group from the University of Minnesota has done just that, by using metamaterials that have very specific, sub-millimetre patterns etched into the surface to manipulate and steer the sound waves as they interact. Their experiment, published recently in&lt;em&gt; Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, involved a 7cm-long piece of 3D-printed plastic, designed to incorporate a pattern of shallow grooves along one edge. Sure enough, the team was able to move the object sideways and, remarkably, pull it back towards the source of the sound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;By optimising and scaling up this approach, the team is hoping to apply it to contactless control in robotics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>One step closer to easy green energy</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Burning hydrogen produces nothing more polluting than water vapour." src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/water.jpeg" height="1063" alt="Burning hydrogen produces water vapour." width="1596"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Hydrogen has long been touted as a potentially revolutionary green source of energy. Burning the gas produces nothing more polluting than water vapour, and making it is trivially easy. Just hook up some electrodes to an electric current, then dunk them in water. Try it with a nine-volt battery and a couple of wires and you&amp;rsquo;ll soon see bubbles of hydrogen forming on one wire and oxygen on the other. Given that the chemistry is so simple, and we have access to literally oceans of raw materials, why haven&amp;rsquo;t we already transitioned to a hydrogen economy? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Unfortunately, unless your water is incredibly pure, you will initiate a load of other wholly undesirable chemical reactions. This means direct electrolysis of sea water is unfeasible. You could desalinate the water first, but this requires more energy than would be obtained from burning the hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Thankfully, a team from Nanjing Tech University, China have recently solved this problem by combining the evaporation and electrolysis steps inside a single reactor. The reactor consists of two chambers &amp;ndash; one with sea water, the other with salt-free water and the electrodes. Separating the chambers are a pair of waterproof breathable membranes (much like those in your waterproof jacket) with gas trapped between them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Potassium hydroxide is added to the water in the inner chamber until it is at a higher concentration than the salt in the sea water. This means the water will diffuse from the sea water chamber to the higher concentration chamber within. But the only way it can move from one chamber to the other is via the gas-filled gap between the membranes. Liquid water can&amp;rsquo;t make it through, but water vapour can &amp;ndash; leaving the salt behind. The clean water can then be safely split into hydrogen and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The team have already extensively tested the system, producing over a million litres of hydrogen gas in just a few months. With cheap hydrogen production now within our sights, we can think about how to use it for transport, heavy industries and to heat our homes. We are one step closer to a source of green energy that is also easy and practical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p></div>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <title>The results are in!</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;
