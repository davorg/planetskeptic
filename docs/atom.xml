<p class="lead">I’ve been telling you, <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/08/the-bell-curve-murray-herrnstein-genetics-hereditarianism-inequality/">Charles Murray is an ignorant hack</a>. I can’t stand listening to this know-nothing pontificating on genetics when he’s so full of shit on the topic, which doesn’t stop him from being arrogantly confident about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s a good critique of <i>The Bell Curve</i> — it’s hard to believe we still have to argue about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Understandably, these arguments provoked the ire of progressively minded scientists and commentators. However, the sweeping and reflexive manner in which opponents of the hereditarian arguments advanced their objections to The Bell Curve often led these critics to adopt counterproductive conclusions. Unhelpfully, they conflated two distinct issues. The first is the question of what it means to claim that something is genetic, and the second is the inevitability of certain life outcomes based on the biology of a particular organism.</p>
<p>Properly speaking, genetics concerns some characteristic of an organism varying across individuals in a group in a given context. It is, by definition, not an explanation of the behavior or development of a given individual in a given instance. Conflating the issue of the causes of differences with that of the inevitability of the development of a particular organism is an important part of the hereditarian rhetorical strategy deployed by the likes of Herrnstein and Murray. To the extent that their arguments have managed to gain some traction in the world, it has been because they have managed to convince their critics to commit the error for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa there — the heart of my criticisms of Murray has always been that genetics is not as determinative as the naive people who learned about Punnett squares in fourth grade think. But do go on, this is an important definitional issue and bears repeating.</p>
<blockquote><p>But the confusion in Murray and Herrnstein’s thinking doesn’t just stop at their pessimism about the kind of practical responses to differences purportedly caused by genetics — it goes all the way down to their understanding of what genetics is. Let’s start by clarifying what we mean by “genetic” and outline why that which is genetic is not necessarily inevitable. For one, genetics deals with groups of organisms rather than the life outcomes of individual organisms. All organisms have genes, but it takes groups of organisms to have genetics because genetics is ultimately about how variation is structured within a group.</p>
<p>Take a single tomato plant in isolation. It has a genome that is between one-fourth and one-third the size of that of a human’s in terms of the raw amount of DNA. Inside its genome are a few tens of thousands of genes, which, in this case, are stretches of the genome that form a chemical template for the cellular production of the proteins and other biochemicals that are vital for the structure and function of organisms. However, since we are dealing with a single plant at a single point in time, there is no comparative context that would allow us to identify the differences among organisms that characterize the rich diversity of life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly! This is also why it’s important that students actually do real crosses with real organisms. The abstractions of theory might tell you that oh, one quarter of the progeny will have a particular phenotype, but when you sit down and have to closely examine a thousand flies, you get to see all the variation you did <em>not</em> predict and you learn that it’s never as simple as the models tell you it is. The variation is also <em>interesting</em>.</p>
<p>But yes, genetics is fundamentally probabilistic. You can’t use it to predict individual destiny. It’s also the case that genetics has significant interplay with the environment.</p>
<blockquote><p>But even having many organisms to compare is not sufficient for a biological system to display genetics in the proper sense of the term. Genetics in the sense that matters is ultimately about variation that arises from genetic differences. To see this, think again about tomatoes. They can be cloned with ease by taking cuttings from a single plant and growing them in their own allotments of soil. Genetically, the different newly individualized plants will be identical to one another, with the exception of a very few mutations — spontaneous changes to DNA that can occur during cellular replication.</p>
<p>If we were to compare a large number of these cloned tomato plants, we would find many differences among them. The shape and sizes of leaves would differ, as would the coloration of the fruits and the pattern of branching along the stalks. Since, on account of being clones, the plants are all genetically identical, these differences could not be attributable to genetics. While each of the plants has genes and we have a group of plants to form the basis for comparison needed to establish that there is variation, there are no genetic differences among the plants that could account for any of that variation. That is, while our tomato plants have genes, they display no genetic differences among one another despite having physiological differences.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that’s always been obvious if you actually look at populations. I had tanks of zebrafish that were about as genetically uniform as you can get, highly inbred for over a century — yet I could recognize individuals in a tank and see differences in behavior. I’ve only been inbreeding spiders for a half dozen generations, but I don’t see variation diminishing, at least not yet.</p>
<p>How do people take Murray seriously when his fundamental understanding of biology is <em>so wrong</em>?</p>

<p>Ugh. The old ghoul should be treated as a shameful embarrassment, but instead he’s lionized by some now as much as he was in life (he died in 1943). This newspaper article from 1926 is incredible, not only for how credulous the journalist was,but for how smugly and confidently Hrdlicka makes predictions about the future evolution of the American population — don’t worry about the flappers, they’ll be strict parents.</p>

<p class="lead">Pay attention, Republicans. I know this is what you want.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/academics/2023/08/16/chaos-reigns-new-college-florida-fall-semester-nears">Florida’s New College has had a rocky time since DeSantis was elected governor</a>. He hates the liberal arts university, and placed a lot of anti-education administrators in charge — first and foremost, that execrable hack Chris Rufo, straight from the anti-science propaganda outlet, the Discovery Institute.</p>
<p>But first, some good news! Enrollments are up.</p>
<blockquote><p>The incoming freshman class, which is the largest in New College’s history, will include at least 341 students; 155, or just under half, are student athletes, according to university spokesperson Nathan March.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is very good news. I know my university has suffered with low enrollments for the past few years, thanks to the pandemic. My upper-level course enrollments are still looking worryingly low this year, but my freshman class is having a surge, which is promising for the future. I’d say this also promises excellent prospects for New College, except…</p>
<p>They seem to be using athletics to lure in new students. Student athletes are great, well-rounded students for the most part, so that’s not intrinsically bad, but the question is whether the new class is appropriately focused. We have lots of student athletes at UMM too, but they know their primary goal is to get an education. Is that true for new students attracted to New College?</p>
<p>I also wonder, given the notoriety of the changes Florida Republicans have been imposing, how many of these new students are right wing goons seeing an opportunity to undermine a liberal arts university.</p>
<p>Another problem: they don’t seem to have planned ahead. They’ve got more first year students, but no place to put them, so they’ve booked an off-campus hotel to house the surplus.</p>
<blockquote><p>Students first heard in June that there was a chance their housing contracts, which were finalized in April, could change, according to a Tampa Bay Times article from July. Apartments typically reserved for juniors and seniors would now house the more than 100 new student athletes New College had admitted for the fall.</p>
<p>The remaining students are being squeezed into the other dorms on campus—except for a number of rooms that are offline due to mold and other structural problems—or being asked to live in a nearby hotel, the Home2 Suites by Hilton Sarasota Bradenton Airport, if they cannot secure their own off-campus housing. The college has rented out the entire Home2 Suites for the semester, totaling 133 beds, according to the contract between the institution and the hotel.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oops, there’s the student athletes getting priority again. The hotel is a mile off campus, requiring students to walk along a busy highway to get to class.</p>
<blockquote><p>Students placed in the Home2 Suites hotel worry about how they will commute to and from New College, about a mile away. For those without vehicles, the journey consists of a 15-minute walk largely along a stretch of busy highway. Parents and faculty have also complained that high levels of crime make the area unsafe, especially at night. While a shuttle is available, it is infrequent—running hourly until 11 p.m.—and can only carry a handful of passengers.</p>
<p>“They don’t seem to be able to plan ahead very well at all,” said Hannah Galantino-Homer, whose son was assigned to live in the Home2 Suites, although he had already decided to transfer out of New College by the time he got the news a few weeks ago. “Like, you don’t think people need to be on campus after [11]?”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a huge coordination and planning problem. If your enrollments are over your capacity, the responsible thing to do is tighten up your admission requirements and get the numbers down to what you <em>can</em> handle. Recruiting lots of students mainly on their athletic ability is not a great long-term solution.</p>
<p>I haven’t even gotten to their big problem yet: they’re hemorrhaging faculty.</p>
<blockquote><p>When a committee of the New College of Florida Board of Trustees met in July, a whopping 36 faculty members had already left since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis initiated a conservative restructuring of the institution in January. That number has subsequently grown to more than 40, Amy Reid, the sole faculty member on the board, told Inside Higher Ed.</p>
<p>Now, as students prepare for the fall semester, the impact of the faculty exodus is becoming apparent: many classes won’t be offered at New College this term.</p>
<p>The course catalogue was already sparse when students first began looking at classes last spring. Dani Delaney, the mother of one former New College student who is transferring to Hampshire College in Massachusetts—which guaranteed admission to all New College students in good standing—said her son could only find two classes that counted towards his “area of concentration” (which is what New College calls majors). When he contacted the institution about the lack of relevant courses, she said, he was told the course catalogue was “in flux” and to “choose something else.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a disaster for a small university, where we’re often operating on the knife’s edge of staffing.You <em>need</em> a critical mass of diverse skills to properly teach a discipline. For instance, our physics department lost two faculty to retirement, leaving one person to teach <em>everything</em> (we didn’t plan far enough ahead), which is not viable. We were frantically scrambling to hire short term faculty while trying to get approval to hire tenure-track replacements. I can’t imagine what the New College departments are doing, adding the abrupt losses to the fact that New College is not an attractive venue for the best new faculty. On top of that, they’re disorganized and using political ideology to wreck programs.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For neuroscience, there’s only one elective beyond the introductory level right now, which is not healthy,” Leininger said, noting that the number of faculty in NCF’s neuroscience program has declined from three to one. “The number of choices students have this year is drastically reduced … if one of those classes conflicts with another class they have to take that is completely required, they’re going to have trouble staying on track for their major.”</p>
<p>Leininger said she received permission from her new institution to teach New College’s neurobiology course over Zoom—a plan the NCF administration at first seemed to embrace. In an email to Leininger that she shared with Inside Higher Ed, Bradley Thiessen, the college’s interim provost said he would “advocate” for her to teach the course if she was willing and able to do so.</p>
<p>But about two months later, she got word from NCF that she would not be allowed to teach the class, for reasons that were not explained. She suspects it may have something to do with her outspoken opposition to the direction DeSantis and the board are taking the institution, which has included speaking to the media about her decision to leave and reposting criticisms of the administration on X.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s what happens when you let incompetent hacks take charge. They’re losing the confidence of the students and their parents, too.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dani Delaney’s son, a rising sophomore, decided he wouldn’t return to New College this semester in large part because he felt uneasy about the university’s decision to walk back the housing assignments students chose last spring.</p>
<p>He replied to multiple emails from the residential life department saying he wouldn’t be attending in the fall. Nevertheless, he received a notice on Aug. 9 telling him he had forfeited his spot in campus housing by failing to respond.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘Oh my god, how many other people might have gotten that same email of, hey, basically, you’re on your own, kid,” Delaney said. “It just shows that they have not committed to what’s in the best interest of the student body. It’s so wrong, the way they’ve gone about it. The disorganization—I can’t wrap my brain around it. This is not how you run a college.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how many of those new enrollments will still be there in a year or two? How many will be able to successfully graduate?</p>
<p>There might be a bit of climate shock moving from Florida to Minnesota, but we’d welcome any transfer students who’d like to attend a stable, reliable university, with the capacity to handle them and also the responsibility to provide a good learning environment.</p>

<p class="lead">Classes start in one week (there are also way too many meetings this week), and I’ve been housebound far too long, so this weekend is my last chance to escape for a bit before the crunch hits. And then I discover there’s an <a href="https://www.exoticpetfairs.com/">Exotic Pet Fair</a> in Eau Claire this weekend. Perfect! It’s a twofer — I get to visit my granddaughter, and take her with us to go spider shopping. I’m in the market for a nice show tarantula for the lab, and maybe a black widow or two.</p>
<p>It’s not all spiders. They also have birds, reptiles, bunnies, guinea pigs, etc., so even a kid who isn’t that much into spiders should be entertained. I’ll also be glad to just get out for a day.</p>
<p>(Don’t worry — I’ll consult with experts, and won’t be getting any endangered species. If we get <i>Latrodectus</i>,I think I can keep them reliably confined. I don’t want to go do down in history as the guy who populated the basement with black widows, like the former professor who let cockroaches loose in the building.)</p>

<p class="lead">Things are not going well for Sam Bankman-Fried, the big-time crypto con man. He’s been out on bail, living the easy life pending his trial, but he just can’t resist blabbing and conspiring to intimidate witnesses to his crimes, so <a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/08/15/crypto-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-goes-to-jail-sec-appeals-ripple-ruling-prime-trust-bankrupt-the-tangled-tale-of-trueusd-and-tron/">he earned a hard slap from justice</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail has been revoked for witness tampering — specifically, that he shared ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison’s private diary with a New York Times reporter. This was the last straw for Judge Lewis Kaplan, who said the documents were “something that someone who has been in a relationship would be unlikely to share with anyone except to hurt and frighten the subject.”</p>
<p>Previously, Sam tried to get in touch via Signal with another witness, former FTX US lawyer Ryne Miller, about getting their stories straight — which nearly saw Sam’s bail revoked that time.</p>
<p>Our hero is currently at MDC Brooklyn — notoriously one of the worst jails in the federal system — but the government has asked that he be remanded at Putnam, where he’ll be allowed more computer access to prepare for his upcoming trial on October 2.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s going to be a fun trial.</p>
<p>Reading that, though, I was somehow reminded of someone else with a penchant for blustering and threatening witnesses on social media, someone else currently facing an October trial date, someone — I can’t quite put my finger on who — currently living freely in a gilded mansion in Florida. What’s the worst state jail in Georgia? I think he needs to spend some time there.</p>

Many studies have highlighted the importance of factors such as age, weight (or body mass index) and existing conditions to an individual&amp;rsquo;s risk of infection, hospitalisation and death. But it also turned out that the picture was more complex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the earliest days of the pandemic, there was an explosion of large studies trying to understand how our genetics might help explain the virus&amp;rsquo;s diverse and often mysterious disease trajectory. One such effort was from a global consortium of doctors and scientists known as GenOMICC, which had already been looking into genetic determinants of severe illness following infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the first two years of the pandemic, tens of thousands of samples were taken from critically ill Covid patients, many from intensive care units. Analyses were then conducted to try to identify genes that might be associated with the worst patient outcomes. Severe responses to Covid-19 often involve a total breakdown in normal immune signalling. This can result in a dangerous influx of normally helpful immune cells and proteins into the sites of infection (lungs, in this case). It is therefore not surprising that many of the 49 genetic variants identified as being associated with critical illness from Covid code for proteins involved in immunity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In May, in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, GenOMICC reported finding links between severe Covid and a wide range of genes and their patterns of activity. Encouragingly, some are already known targets of existing drugs that could potentially be repurposed for treatment of severe Covid. The report also identified an association between severe illness and multiple genes involved in how the virus actually enters the patient&amp;rsquo;s cells. These findings provide useful insights into how an individual&amp;rsquo;s route to infection, as well as their biological response to it, may determine why some people get critically ill with Covid, whilst close to a third of us have no symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Credit: Rasande Tyskar" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/49706740503_391805a5d9_c.jpg" height="533" alt="A banner hangs on the side of a building bearing the message: 'Leave no-one behind'" width="799"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a humanitarian agency, publishes an annual list of the world&amp;rsquo;s most neglected crises &amp;ndash; highlighting those &amp;ldquo;whose suffering rarely makes international headlines, who receive little or no assistance, and who never become the centre of attention for international diplomacy efforts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It recently published its list for 2022 &amp;ndash; analysing the crises that received the least attention. All are in Africa and Latin America: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Mali, Sudan, Venezuela and Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sudan&amp;rsquo;s inclusion on the list is notable because the research for the report was done in 2022 &amp;ndash; before the outbreak of violence between the military junta and the rebel Rapid Support Forces that has killed thousands and displaced millions since April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Already in 2022, a third of Sudan&amp;rsquo;s population required aid amid a political and economic crisis and the impacts of climate change, according to the NRC, but less than half of the required funding was received. What&amp;rsquo;s more, the country was hosting over a million refugees from other countries, many of whom have now had to flee again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a spike in coverage of the crisis after the outbreak of war this year. Data from Google Trends, which gives an indication of how much the search engine&amp;rsquo;s hundreds of millions of users are following a topic, shows that searches for &amp;ldquo;Sudan&amp;rdquo; rose quickly in April. But by May they had more or less returned to previous levels, even though the conflict and accompanying atrocities are far from over. By contrast, searches for &amp;ldquo;Ukraine&amp;rdquo; remain elevated nearly 18 months after the war began.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The UK has created no safe passage for refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan. Home Secretary Suella Braverman suggested that those wanting to seek asylum in Britain could present themselves to the UN Refugee Agency for resettlement, but such a scheme doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. Neighbouring countries, particularly Egypt and Chad, are hosting hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees alone, with the potential for instability to spill over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The UK and other governments could and should be doing so much more, from creating asylum routes to providing humanitarian aid and engaging in serious diplomatic efforts. But far from that, the UK has actually cut aid to many of these neglected crises in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;None of these countries is neglected by accident,&amp;rdquo; the report authors write. &amp;ldquo;The powerful response to the suffering inflicted by the war in Ukraine has shown that neglect is in fact a choice. Where there is the will, political action can be impactful and swift, funding vast, and media coverage extensive.&amp;rdquo; Humanitarian compassion cannot be based on geopolitics. While there is a limit to what we can do as individuals, we urge our readers to keep learning about these crises and pushing for action wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

    <title>How advances in organ donation are saving lives</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6153/how-advances-in-organ-donation-are-saving-lives#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/roman-kraft-0EVKn3-5JSU-unsplash.jpg" height="1281" alt="Two people holding hands" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In June, Northern Ireland introduced opt-out organ donation, finally joining the rest of the UK. This means that adults are considered to have given their consent to be a potential organ donor after their death unless they specifically say they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The change will likely save many lives. Ten to 15 patients die each year in Northern Ireland while awaiting a transplant. Currently, there are around 150 people on the waiting list. The new law is named after six-year-old D&amp;aacute;ith&amp;iacute; Mac Gabhann, who has been waiting for a heart transplant for five years. His family fought for the change in law, alongside campaigners who pointed out that 90 per cent of people in Northern Ireland supported organ donation but only half were signed up to the Organ Donor Register.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trend towards opt-out across the UK mirrors the rest of Europe. Most of the continent has now shifted to an opt-out system. However, when it comes to advancing organ donations, the evidence shows that opt-out legislation is often insufficient on its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Public education is key. Under soft opt-out systems, like those in the UK, family members can intervene to block a donation after a relative&amp;rsquo;s death &amp;ndash; this often happens because families aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what their relative wanted, so it&amp;rsquo;s important that people talk about their beliefs and intentions. But above all, systems to identify opportunities for donations and good matches with patients need to be improved. That could take many forms, including new technologies. The National Institute for Health and Care Research and the NHS are helping to fund the development of a system using artificial intelligence. Researchers believe that AI could prove more effective than surgeons at examining donor organs and assessing their suitability for transplant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team estimates that the new system could result in up to 200 more patients receiving kidney transplants and 100 more receiving liver transplants every year in the UK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move towards opt-out organ donation is a positive sign of societal progress. Increasing the availability of organs for donation will only become more important as our populations age, meaning that a lower percentage of organs will be suitable for transplant. Demand always outstrips supply, and we must carry on doing what we can, whether through changing legislation, public awareness or technological progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organ donation saves lives, and anything that helps one more organ reach a patient in need is a change worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

    <title>A million Britons are at risk of disenfranchisement at the next general election</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6152/a-million-britons-are-at-risk-of-disenfranchisement-at-the-next-general-election#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/red-dot-Q98X_JVRGS0-unsplash-_1_.jpg" height="1440" alt="Polling station" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The local election in May was the first UK election to implement new regulations that require voters to show a photo ID. Fears that this requirement would prevent some people from voting &amp;ndash; weakening British democracy and risking the disenfranchisement of marginalised groups &amp;ndash; were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Electoral Commission&amp;rsquo;s full report is expected in September, but its interim report published in June revealed that nearly 14,000 people were denied a vote (the Commission noted that these figures are likely an underestimation). Roughly 0.7 per cent of people were initially turned away from stations for not having an admissible form of identification, such as a passport, driving licence or voter certificate. Most of those people returned later with the correct ID and were able to vote but there were still at least 0.25 per cent who tried to and could not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is harder to measure is how many people simply stayed at home on the day because they did not possess the right form of ID, and how many turned back before they reached the ballot-issuing desk &amp;ndash; some polling stations warned people at the entrance about the requirement and the number of voters leaving at this point was not recorded. As a result, we will likely never know the full impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Due to electoral rules, it was not possible to collect comprehensive demographic data. But a small survey carried out by the Electoral Commission suggested that &amp;ldquo;some people found it harder than others to show accepted voter ID, including disabled people and the unemployed.&amp;rdquo; This appears to confirm concerns that the new regulations would have the gravest effect on people already marginalised and therefore less likely to have the correct ID, including ethnic minorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Photo ID has already been required in Northern Ireland for two decades. Toby James, a professor of politics and public policy at the University of East Anglia, told MPs that about 2.3 per cent of the electorate failed to vote in the first Northern Ireland assembly election following the introduction of the requirements as a direct consequence, and that it would be reasonable to expect a similar figure across the UK. If accurate, that will mean the voices of 1.1 million people who want to have a say on our next government will go unheard because of the rule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The justification for voter ID requirements is that they will prevent people voting in somebody else&amp;rsquo;s name at polling stations &amp;ndash; an offence known as &amp;ldquo;personation&amp;rdquo;. Yet this justification does not stand up to scrutiny. In 2019 there were just two allegations of personation at polling stations that resulted in cautions or convictions, out of 58 million votes cast in the UK that year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That gives rise to the question of the true motivation. Given the groups most affected, critics see a cynical attempt by the Conservative government to disenfranchise voters who might be less inclined to support them. In an extraordinary statement at the National Conservatism conference in May, former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg appeared to admit as much &amp;ndash; though he noted that the ploy may have backfired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Parties that try and gerrymander end up finding their clever scheme comes back to bite them, as, dare I say, we found by insisting on voter ID for elections,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;We found the people who didn&amp;rsquo;t have ID were elderly and they, by and large, voted Conservative, so we made it hard for our own voters and we upset a system that worked perfectly well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elections need to be secure, but they also need to be as accessible as possible. At best, the voter ID requirement weakens our democracy without adequate justification. At worst, it is a profoundly undemocratic attempt at voter suppression. Whichever it is, the outcome is the same: Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of disenfranchisement at the next general election.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

So-called &amp;ldquo;cheap&amp;rdquo; food is something we pay for three times: The first time at the checkout at the supermarket; the second through our taxes, in subsidising agriculture &amp;ndash; there are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; billions of pounds a year going to subsidising agriculture, mostly to encourage it down the wrong path; and the third is much more significant financially, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;ou&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;r tax pounds going to clean up the mess to our health and to the environment that&amp;rsquo;s created by the so-called &amp;ldquo;cheap&amp;rdquo; food culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; &lt;p class="Paragraph SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;What &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;I think we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; need to do is to create the economic environment where we do the right thing, where we create a future for our children, we move to regenerative farming, and we make it a policy that decent food, planet-saving nutritional food, should be a basic human right. It &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; be somethi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;ng that you have to be well off to afford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="Paragraph SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;Can we produce enough through regenerative farming to feed our growing population?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; &lt;p class="Paragraph SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;The answer to that is yes... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;We currently produce enough food for more than twice the population of the planet. We just waste so much of it ... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;The amount of grain fed to farmed animals worldwide every year represents enough food to sustain four billion people annually. Much of the food value of that grain is wasted when converted to factory farmed meat, milk and eggs, which represents the biggest single form of food waste on the planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; &lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; &lt;p class="Paragraph SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;Whose responsibility is it to fix this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; &lt;p class="Paragraph SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;It really needs leadership from the highest level, so here &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; talking about the United Nations who should be creating a global agreement to move away from industrial agriculture towards regenerative production. Governments absolutely need to create the policy and subsidy regimes that are going to be necessary to shift production and consumption patterns in the way that we need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; Companies, too, need to come on board... A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;nd we can all seize the power of our plate three times a day by choosing to eat more plants and less and better meat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; &lt;p class="Paragraph SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;Are there any broader lessons we can take from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;what we got wrong with industrial farming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; &lt;p class="Paragraph SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;We &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun AdvancedProofingIssueV2Themed SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;have to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; take a 360&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;degree pers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;pective.

<p>I am delighted to say that the second series of our On Your Mind podcast has launched today!!</p>



<p>Each week, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will explore aspects of the human psyche, including astrology, how the clothes we wear influence our thoughts, attraction, friendship, dreaming, mind control and much much more.  We will also be joined by some special guests as we attempt to answer all of your questions about psychology. The first series reached No.1 in Apple Podcast’s Science charts, and so we hope that you can join us. </p>



<p>Our first episode looks at creativity and explores how to have good ideas and whether children are more creative than adults. You can listen <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2txmeCf9U2rj4aAdMLoczK">here</a>.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
