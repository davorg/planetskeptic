    <title>The horrible ghouls of 20th century anthropology</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/mary-sara.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/mary-sara-233x300.jpeg" alt="" width="233" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-70947" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/mary-sara-233x300.jpeg 233w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/mary-sara-117x150.jpeg 117w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/mary-sara.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px"/></a></p>
<p class="lead">This is a photo of Mary Sara, an 18 year old Sami woman who traveled to Seattle in 1933, accompanying her mother, who was getting cataract surgery. While there, Mary died of tuberculosis, which is tragedy enough…but then the ghouls arrived.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wapo.st/3QCIz9R">Smithsonian wanted her brain</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The young woman — whose family was Sami, or indigenous to areas that include northern Scandinavia — had traveled with her mother by ship from her Alaska hometown at the invitation of physician Charles Firestone, who had offered to treat the older woman for cataracts. Now, Firestone sought to take advantage of Sara’s death for a “racial brain collection” at the Smithsonian Institution. He contacted a museum official in May 1933 by telegram.</p>
<p>Ales Hrdlicka, the 64-year-old curator of the division of physical anthropology at the Smithsonian’s U.S. National Museum, was interested in Sara’s brain for his collection. But only if she was “full-blood,” he noted, using a racist term to question whether her parents were both Sami.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Smithsonian houses over 30,000 body parts, including hundreds of brains.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nearly 100 years later, Sara’s brain is still housed by the institution, wrapped in muslin and immersed in preservatives in a large metal container. It is stored in a museum facility in Maryland with 254 other brains, amassed mostly in the first half of the 20th century. Almost all of them were gathered at the behest of Hrdlicka, a prominent anthropologist who believed that White people were superior and collected body parts to further now-debunked theories about anatomical differences between races.</p></blockquote>
<p>There they sit to this day, gathered by Ales Hrdlicka, who somehow became a curator at the Smithsonian and a prominent defender of racist pseudoscience.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hrdlicka, who was born in what is now the Czech Republic, received medical training from the Eclectic Medical College of New York City and the New York Homeopathic Medical College in Manhattan before moving into the field of anthropology. He was seen as one of the country’s foremost authorities on race, sought by the government and members of the public to prove that people’s race determined physical characteristics and intelligence.</p>
<p>He was also a longtime member of the American Eugenics Society, an organization dedicated to racist practices designed to control human populations and “improve” the genetic pool, baseless theories that would be widely condemned after the Nazis used them to justify genocide and forced sterilization during the Holocaust. In speeches and personal correspondence, he spoke openly about his belief in the superiority of White people, once lamenting that Black people were “the real problem before the American people.”</p>
<p>“There are differences of importance between the brains of the negro and European, to the general disadvantage of the former,” he wrote in a 1926 letter to a University of Vermont professor. “Brains of individual negroes may come up to or near the standard of some individual whites; but such primitive brains as found in some negroes … would be hard to duplicate in normal whites.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That is truly remarkable. The article focuses on the abuse of autonomy of so many people who had their brains scooped out and sent off to Washington DC, and that is definitely an important issue. But I was reading it and asking myself, “What science was done? What did we learn? What did he discover to justify calling the brains of black people ‘primitive’?” It turns out to have been <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The extent of Hrdlicka’s own research on the brains is unclear. When a professor wrote to him and asked about the differences he found between the brains of people of different races, he replied that research studies showed the superiority of White brains, without citing any studies of his own. He published a 1906 study on brain preservatives, recording the weight of human and animal brains and comparing how they fared in a chemical solution. But The Post found no other research on the brains by Hrdlicka.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know a bit about neuroscience, and I find the whole approach unproductive and baffling. Sure, you could do crude measurements, weighing brains and slicing them open to measure the gross morphology of regions and nuclei…but we know that all of that is so variable and often so irrelevant to the functioning of those brains that you can’t learn anything from it. We simply don’t know enough about the details of how brains work that, aside from major abnormalities, you can’t conclude anything about the minds housed in those lumps of meat by hacking them up, and you especially couldn’t do anything with the information in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Basically, Hrdlicka was nothing but an obsessive and rather morbid collector. His ‘credibility’, what there was of it, rested entirely on accumulating the largest collection of brains, like bloody tragic Pokemon. He didn’t have to think. He didn’t have to study. He was just gathering gory fragments of human beings and parading them before other bad scientists who thought this was an accomplishment. The Smithsonian should be ashamed, we should all be ashamed that this charade of race ‘science’ was perpetrated for so long, and that people continue to think this was a useful approach to justify their bigotry to this day.</p>
<p>Hrdlicka really was a ghoul. When an exhibit of Filipino culture, represented by a large number of people from that country, was held at the World’s Fair, he had one thing on his mind: “That summer, Hrdlicka headed to St. Louis, hoping to take brains from Filipinos who died.” He collected four brains from the unfortunate people who died incidentally there (tuberculosis and pneumonia were Hrdlicka’s friends).</p>
<p>Ugh. The Smithsonian, and other museums around the country, need to address this ugly stain on their history, and make amends to the people they exploited for such stupid ends.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-desantis-iowa-state-fair-caucus-reynolds-48b2f382e169ee1b9ae8c9d9dc19dedc">Iowa state fair</a> happened this past weekend, and it was a disgusting spectacle. Iowa has an oversized political reputation, solely because it has the first primary in the presidential election, so <em>every</em> Republican candidate shows up to shake hands and kiss babies and pretend they care about a small farm state, rather than because they enjoy fried-cheese-onna-stick or want to weigh in on the qualities of prize pigs.</p>
<p>There were two spectacles worth noting. One was the way the press fawned over this event, comparing the size of the crowds for various candidates and acting as if this was meaningful. A good healthy journalism wouldn’t care about the opinions of a self-selected mob of yokels and how many corn dogs they ate, they’d be talking about policies and records and, in one case, criminal history. But no, this was a celebrity spectacle with no weight at all.</p>
<p>The second was…Trump is back to <a href="https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1690880861132996610">lying again and hyping the imaginary size of his crowds</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t think I can take another year of this bullshit. Narcissistic serial liars are so 2020.</p>
<p>By the way, the Stevens County Fair took place here last week — I couldn’t go, I’m trapped in a small room in our house cultivating chronic pain, but Mary went, and she said there was less knee-jerk MAGA nonsense and fewer Trump flags waving than last year, so that’s a slightly positive development. Also, Trump didn’t show up.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;I unlimbered my rusty, drugged-up voice to answer a really simple question today. Unfortunately, it&amp;#8217;s the same goddamn stupid question I get from Muslim apologists all the time, and they don&amp;#8217;t listen to the answer anyway, but I&amp;#8217;ve been practically voiceless for a few weeks, so this was an excuse to, you know, &lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t believe I have to start lecturing again in a week and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZsFq9muvCk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcript below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-70937"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, friends &amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been out of it for a while, laid up on steroids and painkillers for the past week or two. I got this email question several days ago, though, and wanted to reply with a video, because I get this kind of question so goddamn often. Just out of the blue I get this kind of email every few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a 16-year-old science-loving young man, my name is Grigor. I would like to ask you a question, this is something I have heard from people around me and especially from the general public, and I wonder if it is true. &amp;#8220;Do bones and flesh exist at the same time?&amp;#8221; This is my question, and I would be very happy if you could explain it to me in a basic embryological way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little background on why I&amp;#8217;m frequently asked this stupid question: many years ago I was confronted by some Muslim fanatics on a street corner in Dublin, and they thought they&amp;#8217;d dazzle me with an amazing insight from the Koran that would prove the truth of their religion. They recited this at me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created man from an essence of clay, then We placed him as a drop of fluid in a safe place. Then We made that drop of fluid into a clinging form, and then We made that form into a lump of flesh, and We made that lump into bones, and We clothed those bones with flesh, and later We made him into other forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key point they tried to make was that Mohammed accurately and precisely summarized embryonic development with those words, &amp;#8220;We made that lump into bones, and We clothed those bones with flesh.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Just no. It&amp;#8217;s a vague description of a process, not very precise at all, and as a sequence, it is incorrect. I said so. It was recorded on video, and ever since I&amp;#8217;ve been getting these incredulous nonsensical requests that I explain myself further. It&amp;#8217;s mildly infuriating. All you have to do is google bone and muscle development and you can see that that simplistic Islamic description is inadequate. There is no sequential development of bones, then flesh &amp;#8212; everything happens in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gastrulation produces a mesodermal tissue, generally undifferentiated, largely made up of mesenchyme, a collection of loose, migrating cells in a slimy matrix. This isn&amp;#8217;t bone. It isn&amp;#8217;t muscle. These cells aggregate into structures called somites &amp;#8212; still not muscle or bone &amp;#8212; which eventually segregate into tissues called sclerotome, which will form cartilage, myotome, which will form muscle, as well as dermatome, the dermis, and syndotome, tendons. I&amp;#8217;m not currently a big fan of tendons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re not bone or muscle yet. The myotomes will differentiate into skeletal muscle, and at the same time, bone will form by condensation in the sclerotome and also in the dermatome. It&amp;#8217;s all a complex pattern of interacting tissues and progressive, branching differentiation, and I&amp;#8217;m sorry, but Mohammed wasn&amp;#8217;t even close, and Grigor, if you were actually interested in science rather than playing games to rationalize your simplistic religious beliefs, you&amp;#8217;d open a textbook rather than begging people on the internet to make excuses for you. Yes. Bones and flesh exist at the same time. It&amp;#8217;s that simple. Mohammed was wrong. It&amp;#8217;s that simple, too.&lt;/p&gt;

All are in Africa and Latin America: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Mali, Sudan, Venezuela and Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sudan&amp;rsquo;s inclusion on the list is notable because the research for the report was done in 2022 &amp;ndash; before the outbreak of violence between the military junta and the rebel Rapid Support Forces that has killed thousands and displaced millions since April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Already in 2022, a third of Sudan&amp;rsquo;s population required aid amid a political and economic crisis and the impacts of climate change, according to the NRC, but less than half of the required funding was received. What&amp;rsquo;s more, the country was hosting over a million refugees from other countries, many of whom have now had to flee again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a spike in coverage of the crisis after the outbreak of war this year. Data from Google Trends, which gives an indication of how much the search engine&amp;rsquo;s hundreds of millions of users are following a topic, shows that searches for &amp;ldquo;Sudan&amp;rdquo; rose quickly in April. But by May they had more or less returned to previous levels, even though the conflict and accompanying atrocities are far from over. By contrast, searches for &amp;ldquo;Ukraine&amp;rdquo; remain elevated nearly 18 months after the war began.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The UK has created no safe passage for refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan. Home Secretary Suella Braverman suggested that those wanting to seek asylum in Britain could present themselves to the UN Refugee Agency for resettlement, but such a scheme doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. Neighbouring countries, particularly Egypt and Chad, are hosting hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees alone, with the potential for instability to spill over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The UK and other governments could and should be doing so much more, from creating asylum routes to providing humanitarian aid and engaging in serious diplomatic efforts. But far from that, the UK has actually cut aid to many of these neglected crises in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;None of these countries is neglected by accident,&amp;rdquo; the report authors write. &amp;ldquo;The powerful response to the suffering inflicted by the war in Ukraine has shown that neglect is in fact a choice. Where there is the will, political action can be impactful and swift, funding vast, and media coverage extensive.&amp;rdquo; Humanitarian compassion cannot be based on geopolitics. While there is a limit to what we can do as individuals, we urge our readers to keep learning about these crises and pushing for action wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

    <title>How advances in organ donation are saving lives</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/roman-kraft-0EVKn3-5JSU-unsplash.jpg" height="1281" alt="Two people holding hands" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In June, Northern Ireland introduced opt-out organ donation, finally joining the rest of the UK. This means that adults are considered to have given their consent to be a potential organ donor after their death unless they specifically say they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The change will likely save many lives. Ten to 15 patients die each year in Northern Ireland while awaiting a transplant. Currently, there are around 150 people on the waiting list. The new law is named after six-year-old D&amp;aacute;ith&amp;iacute; Mac Gabhann, who has been waiting for a heart transplant for five years. His family fought for the change in law, alongside campaigners who pointed out that 90 per cent of people in Northern Ireland supported organ donation but only half were signed up to the Organ Donor Register.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trend towards opt-out across the UK mirrors the rest of Europe. Most of the continent has now shifted to an opt-out system. However, when it comes to advancing organ donations, the evidence shows that opt-out legislation is often insufficient on its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Public education is key. Under soft opt-out systems, like those in the UK, family members can intervene to block a donation after a relative&amp;rsquo;s death &amp;ndash; this often happens because families aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what their relative wanted, so it&amp;rsquo;s important that people talk about their beliefs and intentions. But above all, systems to identify opportunities for donations and good matches with patients need to be improved. That could take many forms, including new technologies. The National Institute for Health and Care Research and the NHS are helping to fund the development of a system using artificial intelligence. Researchers believe that AI could prove more effective than surgeons at examining donor organs and assessing their suitability for transplant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team estimates that the new system could result in up to 200 more patients receiving kidney transplants and 100 more receiving liver transplants every year in the UK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move towards opt-out organ donation is a positive sign of societal progress. Increasing the availability of organs for donation will only become more important as our populations age, meaning that a lower percentage of organs will be suitable for transplant. Demand always outstrips supply, and we must carry on doing what we can, whether through changing legislation, public awareness or technological progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organ donation saves lives, and anything that helps one more organ reach a patient in need is a change worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

    <title>A million Britons are at risk of disenfranchisement at the next general election</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6152/a-million-britons-are-at-risk-of-disenfranchisement-at-the-next-general-election#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/red-dot-Q98X_JVRGS0-unsplash-_1_.jpg" height="1440" alt="Polling station" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The local election in May was the first UK election to implement new regulations that require voters to show a photo ID. Fears that this requirement would prevent some people from voting &amp;ndash; weakening British democracy and risking the disenfranchisement of marginalised groups &amp;ndash; were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Electoral Commission&amp;rsquo;s full report is expected in September, but its interim report published in June revealed that nearly 14,000 people were denied a vote (the Commission noted that these figures are likely an underestimation). Roughly 0.7 per cent of people were initially turned away from stations for not having an admissible form of identification, such as a passport, driving licence or voter certificate. Most of those people returned later with the correct ID and were able to vote but there were still at least 0.25 per cent who tried to and could not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is harder to measure is how many people simply stayed at home on the day because they did not possess the right form of ID, and how many turned back before they reached the ballot-issuing desk &amp;ndash; some polling stations warned people at the entrance about the requirement and the number of voters leaving at this point was not recorded. As a result, we will likely never know the full impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Due to electoral rules, it was not possible to collect comprehensive demographic data. But a small survey carried out by the Electoral Commission suggested that &amp;ldquo;some people found it harder than others to show accepted voter ID, including disabled people and the unemployed.&amp;rdquo; This appears to confirm concerns that the new regulations would have the gravest effect on people already marginalised and therefore less likely to have the correct ID, including ethnic minorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Photo ID has already been required in Northern Ireland for two decades. Toby James, a professor of politics and public policy at the University of East Anglia, told MPs that about 2.3 per cent of the electorate failed to vote in the first Northern Ireland assembly election following the introduction of the requirements as a direct consequence, and that it would be reasonable to expect a similar figure across the UK. If accurate, that will mean the voices of 1.1 million people who want to have a say on our next government will go unheard because of the rule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The justification for voter ID requirements is that they will prevent people voting in somebody else&amp;rsquo;s name at polling stations &amp;ndash; an offence known as &amp;ldquo;personation&amp;rdquo;. Yet this justification does not stand up to scrutiny. In 2019 there were just two allegations of personation at polling stations that resulted in cautions or convictions, out of 58 million votes cast in the UK that year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That gives rise to the question of the true motivation. Given the groups most affected, critics see a cynical attempt by the Conservative government to disenfranchise voters who might be less inclined to support them. In an extraordinary statement at the National Conservatism conference in May, former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg appeared to admit as much &amp;ndash; though he noted that the ploy may have backfired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Parties that try and gerrymander end up finding their clever scheme comes back to bite them, as, dare I say, we found by insisting on voter ID for elections,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;We found the people who didn&amp;rsquo;t have ID were elderly and they, by and large, voted Conservative, so we made it hard for our own voters and we upset a system that worked perfectly well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elections need to be secure, but they also need to be as accessible as possible. At best, the voter ID requirement weakens our democracy without adequate justification. At worst, it is a profoundly undemocratic attempt at voter suppression. Whichever it is, the outcome is the same: Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of disenfranchisement at the next general election.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

We just waste so much of it ... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;The amount of grain fed to farmed animals worldwide every year represents enough food to sustain four billion people annually.

A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;nd we can all seize the power of our plate three times a day by choosing to eat more plants and less and better meat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; &lt;p class="Paragraph SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;Are there any broader lessons we can take from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;what we got wrong with industrial farming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; &lt;p class="Paragraph SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;We &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun AdvancedProofingIssueV2Themed SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;have to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt; take a 360&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;degree pers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"&gt;pective.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/newhumanistlaurietoast.jpg" height="687" alt="A cartoon shows Laurie Taylor popping, slightly charred, out of a toaster" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I dislike anniversaries. With the help of my Filofax I can usually manage to honour the bulk of my friends&amp;rsquo; birthdays &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Hi Charlotte. Best wishes for your very special day. Gosh doesn&amp;rsquo;t time fly. Do give me a ring next time you&amp;rsquo;re down south&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but I am frankly unable to pronounce with any degree of certainty upon the length of my present marriage, the exact number of years since my pacemaker was fitted or the precise date when my beloved Liverpool were last declared champions of Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the week before last, when I trooped into Broadcasting House to make another edition of my BBC Radio 4 programme Thinking Allowed, I was energetically confronted by my normally cool producer. Did I know the significance of the episode we were about to make? Not really. Did the year 1998 mean anything to me? Not really. Sorry. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My producer gave me a slightly sorrowful smile. &amp;ldquo;Laurie, this is our anniversary. Our programme has now been broadcast on Radio 4 for exactly 25 years. So many great memories! Remember the social mobility programme?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How could I forget? I knew immediately she was talking about the day, 20 years ago, when I was interviewing an expert on social mobility and noticed with alarm that he was sliding from his studio chair. In the hope that he might quickly right himself, I pursued my questioning. &amp;ldquo;Your research indicates an overall decline in social mobility&amp;rdquo;, I said, &amp;ldquo;How might you account for that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I never got my answer because, with a little whimper, my guest slipped further sideways and then, with a little jerk, fell to the studio floor where he lay motionless amid a tangled mass of studio cables. A frantic producer hissed into my earphones. &amp;ldquo;Laurie. Laurie. Go to your emails.&amp;rdquo; Thankfully the guest was fine and in the pub afterwards we laughed ourselves silly over the incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that happy memory epitomises my problem with all such anniversaries: they rarely have a singular dimension. So while it was certainly great fun to remember the day of the disappearing studio guest, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t relish the incident without also remembering that it occurred at the very time that I was desperately trying to end my unhappy relationship with Sandra, suffering from a rather nasty pubic rash, and had just been told by my dentist that the inside of my mouth resembled a blitzed housing estate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a paradox perfectly captured by Philip Larkin in his poem &amp;ldquo;Reference Back&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Truly, though our element is time,&lt;br&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not suited to the long perspectives&lt;br&gt;Open at each instant of our lives.&lt;br&gt;They link us to our losses...&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is perhaps one surprising and positive aspect to anniversaries. They can remind us of the road not taken. Nobody captured that benefit with more fervour than my old friend Angela, who, in a tipsy conversation during her 38th wedding anniversary party, confided this insight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Laurie&amp;rdquo;, she said, glancing across the room to her husband. &amp;ldquo;You know what this anniversary has made me realise? If I had killed Maurice the first time I thought about it, I&amp;rsquo;d have been out of jail by now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No such muddled memories ever interfered with my mother&amp;rsquo;s wholesale embrace of anniversaries. During my childhood, I was frequently reminded that I had been named due to the proximity of my birthday to the date of the martyrdom of Saint Laurence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one respect, Saint Laurence deserved to be honoured. He famously gave all his money away to charity. However, as I later learned, in honouring his anniversary I would also be honouring the date in AD 258 when he was martyred on a red-hot gridiron. As the coals burned into his skin, he had the temerity to give a word of advice to his torturers. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m well done on this side. Turn me over&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For all my horror of anniversaries, I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking that this ancient utterance by my namesake might make a rather fine last set of words &amp;ndash; for myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>I am delighted to say that the second series of our On Your Mind podcast has launched today!!</p>



<p>Each week, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will explore aspects of the human psyche, including astrology, how the clothes we wear influence our thoughts, attraction, friendship, dreaming, mind control and much much more.  We will also be joined by some special guests as we attempt to answer all of your questions about psychology. The first series reached No.1 in Apple Podcast’s Science charts, and so we hope that you can join us. </p>



<p>Our first episode looks at creativity and explores how to have good ideas and whether children are more creative than adults. You can listen <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2txmeCf9U2rj4aAdMLoczK">here</a>.</p>

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It’s called Richard Wiseman’s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
