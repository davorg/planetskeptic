<p class="lead">There’s nothing I can say about this. Russian bad guy Putin has pissed off Russian mercenary and bad guy Prigozhin, and now we’ve got what <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/feud-between-moscow-and-wagner-group-turns-to-all-out-war?ref=home?ref=home">looks like a full-blown civil war</a>, with Prigozhin marching on Moscow, while the Ukrainians stand in awe as their enemy looks to be killing themselves.</p>
<p>I don’t know how this will end! No one knows what will happen! People will die and cities will be devastated, but beyond that, it’s Godzilla vs. Ghidorah.</p>
<p>I think NATO might be flying bags of popcorn into Kiev, but otherwise, I’m just going to sit back and watch incredulously. Hmmm, I might have some popcorn around the house, myself.</p>

<p>I think it’s useful for future generations to see that haters and bigots and morally reprehensible scumbuckets can look like quite ordinary people — middle-aged soccer moms are entirely capable of deep ignorance and hatefulness. It’s also the case that ordinary, respectable institutions can accommodate them, as the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/moms-for-liberty-philadelphia-lgbtq-museum-american-revolution-20230622.html">Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia</a> has done. That museum is hosting a Moms for Liberty event next week, betraying their own reason for existence.</p>
<blockquote><p>Moms for Liberty lobbies for book bans and aims to dictate how history is taught, stripping it of any mention of slavery, racism, and LGBTQ people. The group got its start fighting mask mandates and the teaching of critical race theory. It spreads anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, falsely labels LGBTQ people as “groomers,” and led Florida’s hateful campaign against LGBTQ teachers. It openly harasses transgender and nonbinary young people and their families, advocating new laws and policies to restrict their lives and freedoms.</p>
<p>The group claims an affinity with America’s founding, yet they have failed this test in historical symbolism. Revolutionary Philadelphia was at the forefront of scientific inquiry, education, publishing, medicine, and government — all things that Moms for Liberty lobbies against.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the whole article for more historical examples of how the Moms for Repression are wrong on every count.</p>
<blockquote><p>Newspaper articles about the growing tension between the North American colonies and the British crown were reported alongside dramatic stories of “female husbands” — people assigned the female sex at birth who lived as men and married women. In May 1766, London’s Public Advertiser printed the notice from Lord Chamberlain’s office about the movement of “a quantity of ammunition, and Part of the Troops destined for North America” on the very same page that it also noted the death of “the famous Sarah Paul, who went thro’ a Variety of Adventures in Men’s Clothes, which made a great Eclat about seven Years ago, when she married another young Woman, and was distinguished by the Appellation of the Female Husband.” While living as a man, they went by the name Samuel Bundy.</p>
<p>North American papers embraced these accounts as well. The Pennsylvania Gazette, printed by Ben Franklin in the Franklin Court Printing Office, reported on Charles Hamilton, who was detained in Chester in July 1752 while en route to Philadelphia under suspicion “that the Doctor was a women’ in mens clothes.” Since there was no explicit law against cross-dressing, authorities reported they would only keep Hamilton in prison “till we see whether any Body appears against her, if not she will be discharged.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a real shame. When I interviewed in Philadelphia 30 years ago, one of the things that won me over is that I was just turned loose for a day in the historical district of Philadelphia, which is simply a wonderful place to wander. Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the Benjamin Franklin Museum (but not the Museum of the American Revolution, which did not exist then), all in easy walking distance. Then, in a bit more substantial stroll, you could walk up Market Street to the city hall, and visit all the science and art museums arrayed along Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The heart of the city is a bit old-fashioned in that it’s designed for people walking places, rather than freeways.</p>
<p>And now these horrible people are moving in. You know, if I were interviewing for a position in Philadelphia, and my visit were marred by an encounter with the dishonest harridans of Moms for Liberty, I probably wouldn’t take the job.</p>

<p class="lead">I read Larry Moran’s <a href="https://amzn.to/44cMYDV"><i>What’s in Your Genome?: 90% of Your Genome Is Junk</i></a> this week — it’s a truly excellent book, everyone should read it, and I’ll be making a more thorough review once I get a little time to breathe again. Basically, though, he makes an interdisciplinary case for the sloppiness of our genome, and it’s all that evidence that we should be giving our biology students from day one.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ran into a similar story online. Everything accumulates junk, from your genome to my office to Google. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/15/paid-medical-disinformation/">Cory Doctorow explains how search engines are choking in their own filth</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The internet is increasingly full of garbage, much of it written by other confident habitual liar chatbots, which are now extruding plausible sentences at enormous scale. Future confident habitual liar chatbots will be trained on the output of these confident liar chatbots, producing Jathan Sadowski’s “Habsburg AI”:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jathansadowski/status/1625245803211272194">https://twitter.com/jathansadowski/status/1625245803211272194</a></p>
<p>But the declining quality of Google Search isn’t merely a function of chatbot overload. For many years, Google’s local business listings have been terrible. Anyone who’s tried to find a handyman, a locksmith, an emergency tow, or other small businessperson has discovered that Google is worse than useless for this. Try to search for that locksmith on the corner that you pass every day? You won’t find them – but you will find a fake locksmith service that will dispatch an unqualified, fumble-fingered guy with a drill and a knockoff lock, who will drill out your lock, replace it with one made of bubblegum and spit, and charge you 400% the going rate (and then maybe come back to rob you):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/business/fake-online-locksmiths-may-be-out-to-pick-your-pocket-too.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/business/fake-online-locksmiths-may-be-out-to-pick-your-pocket-too.html</a></p>
<p>Google is clearly losing the fraud/spam wars, which is pretty awful, given that they have spent billions to put every other search engine out of business. They spend $45b every year to secure exclusivity deals that prevent people from discovering or using rivals – that’s like buying a whole Twitter every year, just so they don’t have to compete:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-a-google-antitrust-case-could/">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-a-google-antitrust-case-could/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m thinking I should advertise Myers Spider Removal Service on Google, and then I respond to calls by showing up, collecting a few spiders, bring them back to my lab, and increase their numbers a thousand-fold, which I then return to the house in the dead of night. Then they call me again.</p>
<p>Hey, it’s a business model.</p>
<p>The comparison of Google’s junk to our genome’s junk falls apart pretty quickly, though, because your cells have mechanisms to silence the expression of garbage, while Google is instead motivated to <em>increase</em> expression of junk, because capitalism.</p>

<p class="lead">Years of ignoring Jerry Coyne, a record ruined by the fact that I felt obligated to find out what he’s complaining about in order to address that recent bad article…and what do I find? His usual <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/06/21/the-vexing-problem-of-furries/">half-assed whining about people different from him</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>When I gave a lecture in the Deep South some years ago, I went to dinner with several of the biology faculty, who told me of the occurrence of “furries”  (actually, better known as “otherkins”) among the students. “Otherkins” are students who dress up and act like nonhuman animals in their day-to-day life. But the group the profs were really concerned with were students who identified as animals,  claiming that they had the spirit of animals, insisting on being addressed as the animal they identified with, and wore animal costumes like ears or tails. These are the true “otherkins”. I saw several of these, including one girl who had a horse tail stuck in the back of her pants.  The professors told me that they had been given special instruction by the university on how to treat and deal with the otherkins.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen any otherkins at my University, but this Torygraph article (click on the screenshot to go to the archived piece) notes that it is an issue in Britain, and schools don’t know how to deal with it. I was sent this article by a Brit who couldn’t believe that the phenomenon was real. I assured my correspondent that yes, this is a reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh god. No, it’s not real. Furries/otherkin do exist, but they are fully aware of their identities — they just enjoy role-playing. Seeing a girl with a horsetail stuck in her pants does not mean they’re running around, thinking they are a horse, and that the university needs to provide special instructions for how to deal with them. Just talk to them. You know, like they’re human beings. That works. I’ve even attended a furry convention, and honestly, it’s no more weird than attending a D&amp;D con…or an atheist convention.</p>
<p>What next? Is he going to declare that American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_boxes_in_schools_hoax">schools are putting out kitty litter for the kids who identify as cats</a>?</p>
<p>Anyway, in this case he credulously goes on to tell the story of kids in England thinking they are cats and other animals.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Perhaps tellingly, the incident at Rye College – a Church of England school – happened at the end of a class on “life education” in which children were told by their teacher that there were lots of genders, including “agender – people who don’t believe that they have a gender at all”.</p>
<p>An argument ensued in which two pupils disagreed with the teacher, saying there was no such thing as agender, because “if you have a vagina, you’re a girl and if you have a penis, you’re a boy – that’s it”.</p>
<p>When the pupils told their classmate: “How can you identify as a cat when you’re a girl?” the teacher reprimanded them for “questioning [the child’s] identity”.</p>
<p>In this instance, the teacher in charge of the class appears to have bracketed a child’s desire to be treated as a cat with other children’s desire to be treated as another gender, or genderless.</p></blockquote>
<p>To Coyne, this is evidence of his bigoted presumption that <q>this is a case of social contagion promulgated by both peers and also by teachers who have been indoctrinated by gender activism to accept any child’s assumed identity.</q> Indoctrination! Gender activism! Social contagion!</p>
<p>Except…that’s not what happened at all. It’s all hyper-inflated hyperbole from the UK news media. <a href="https://schoolsweek.co.uk/gender-row-school-none-of-our-pupils-identify-as-a-cat/">The school has said it didn’t happen</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a statement to Schools Week, the trust said it wanted to “clarify that no children at Rye College identifies as a cat or any other animal”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t matter. By then, GB News, the Daily Mail, and Tucker Carlson were promoting the kind of nonsense that finds favor with Coyne, all based on a brief Tik Tok excerpt of a longer discussion held in the classroom. One reporter, <a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2023/06/22/dead-cats-and-transphobic-lies/">Otto English, dug deeper and interviewed one of the people involved</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have taken the time both to establish this individual’s credibility and to safeguard their identity and as such the individual is anonymous and some critical details given to us have been deliberately omitted. I am very aware that the two children who made the recording are also just that – children – and so have taken care to omit details about them and some of the things they are alleged to have said on the day.</p>
<p>I shall refer to the ‘cat’ pupil as ‘Student A’ and the two individuals who made the tape as “B” and “C”.</p>
<p>Our correspondent – present in the room – tells us: <em>I want to make (it) clear that ‘A’ does not identify as a cat</em>.</p>
<p>What, by our source’s account, happened is that there was an ongoing conversation happening between several pupils about identity before B and C engaged with them and – according to our source – as the discussion became increasingly personal and ill-tempered, either B or C then said, apropos of gender: ‘if you identify as a cat or a carrot you are insane’.</p>
<p>In other words, nobody was talking about ‘cats’ until the subject of them was introduced into the conversation by one of the two pupils who later made the recording. This was a broad-ranging conversation about gender and identity between a group of kids in Year 8 which seems to have turned nasty before the teacher intervened.</p>
<p>Our source defends the teacher and says that having started out ‘extremely calm’ she only became ‘irritable’ when the two students became increasingly ‘disrespectful’. </p></blockquote>
<p>That’s it. People can be grumpy when arguing about sex and gender — Coyne should know, he’s a good example. That’s all this was, young people expressing their opinions, and there were no cat-people involved.</p>
<p>It’s simply a British example of the litter boxes in the classroom lie that was spread over here on this side of the Atlantic, and anyone who falls for it should not be taken seriously.</p>

    <title>What supporting my father through Alzheimer's taught me</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6133/what-supporting-my-father-through-alzheimers-taught-me#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="'Old Man in Sorrow' by Vincent van Gogh. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/CRKX0E.jpg" height="1890" alt="'Old Man in Sorrow' by Vincent van Gogh" width="1519"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In November 1901 a woman named Auguste Deter was admitted to the Municipal Asylum for Epileptics and Lunatics in Frankfurt. She was 51 years old. Paranoid delusions about her husband&amp;rsquo;s fidelity had given way to amnesia and disorientation; she failed to recognise old friends and forgot life&amp;rsquo;s daily occurrences the moment they were past. Soon she was unable to look after herself entirely. &amp;ldquo;I have lost myself,&amp;rdquo; she told her 36-year-old physician. His name was Dr Alois Alzheimer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer was that rare thing at the turn of the 20th century, a doctor with an interest in both psychiatry, the workings of the mind, and histology, the study of cell tissue and structure. When he examined Deter&amp;rsquo;s brain after her eventual death in 1906, he found it alarmingly atrophied, abnormally light. Then, looking at it under the microscope, he saw two things he had never seen before. First, the buildup of a brain protein named beta-amyloid into what are known as &amp;ldquo;senile plaques&amp;rdquo;; second, dense tangles of fibrils within the brain&amp;rsquo;s cells that had gone rogue, as it were, choking and ultimately destroying the cells themselves. The damage was greatest where the tangles and the plaques coincided. As many as a third of the cells in Deter&amp;rsquo;s cerebral cortex were destroyed or damaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it seems paradoxical that one of the definitive diseases of old age should have been first identified in someone much younger, Alzheimer himself regarded his discovery as a disease of middle age and entirely distinct from senile dementia. It was a view that held until the 1970s, when it became clear that they were essentially the same phenomenon; the neurologist Robert Katzman showed that Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s was one of the leading causes of death in the US, its presence in the deceased elided by a wide range of more immediately catastrophic health events recorded on the death certificate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow it seems apt for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s to be hiding in plain sight like that. It is after all a disease of deception, its presence masked in the patient by the general cognitive decline that we all experience once we pass the age of 50 or so. This can be compounded by the patient&amp;rsquo;s own unwillingness or inability to recognise or acknowledge the disease as it encroaches, and by the person&amp;rsquo;s stubborn, desperate retention of routine and behaviour &amp;ndash; even while memory and, arguably, identity crumble around them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My father died of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s three days after his 90th birthday in May 2016. He had been admitted with sepsis four days earlier, but his renal functions had been failing, resulting in repeated spells in hospital, since the previous autumn. There was one long spell of about a month in the spring from which he never really rallied. All semblance of independent life ended. There were four 15-minute visits from health workers spread across the empty plain of the day, and then soon a nurse staying overnight in case he accidentally pulled his catheter out &amp;ndash; and, more generally, to comfort a newfound panic that overwhelmed him when he was alone, particularly at night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t have been much more than a week into this new restricted life that he stopped coming downstairs, or even getting out of bed. He ate less and less. By this time he was incontinent as well as cathetered and had lost any sense of the indignity of the experience, lost his sense of privacy, of decency, of inhibition. He would have been appalled, had he known. He was, I would have said, a proud man; he wanted to live in his home of 50 years on his own terms. The change was disorienting. A few weeks earlier, in hospital, he had to be physically restrained by two security guards to stop him discharging himself against medical advice. Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards were invoked. He was sedated. Most of that fight seemed to have drained away. It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to say that he gave up the ghost: it implies a degree of agency and choice on his part, and the dignity that goes with a sense of volition. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know if that is actually true; but it is comforting, in a small way, to think it might be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The role of loneliness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Memory plays tricks on all of us. Or rather, we conspire with it in a process that psychologists call &amp;ldquo;coherence&amp;rdquo;, shaping memories to fit narratives we find more comfortable, or that accommodate our present sense of self better. My recollection is that Dad&amp;rsquo;s difficulties date to the last couple of years of his life, but going back through the emails between myself and my three siblings to research this piece, I see that we had serious concerns about his memory at least as far back as 2011. Perhaps I want to avoid thinking about ways in which those last years might have been better for him. Perhaps we should have pushed him harder to recognise his predicament. But would the emotional distress, never mind the potential of ruptured familial relationships, have been worth the cost? It is not as if it is a disease with a cure. Perhaps he was already, in some senses, unreachable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our mother had died of esophageal cancer early in 2009, and grief, loneliness and depression weighed heavily on my father. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it was a sorrow he ever had the wherewithal to adapt to, never mind overcome. He was prescribed citalopram, an anti-depressant, but we were never sure how reliably he took it. We were never sure how reliably he took any medication in those years. He bristled at the intrusion whenever we enquired; the irritation, touched with defensiveness, was entirely in character, but I wonder now how much that kind of sensitivity, possibly extending to resentment, was related to the Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s. The hippocampus nestles beside the amygdala in the brain, and the amygdala regulates the great primal emotions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was a function of the disease too, then, that he seemed to be more emotional about Mum&amp;rsquo;s loss the longer it receded into the past. When we all met on the anniversary of Mum&amp;rsquo;s death, or on her birthday, on the hillside where we had scattered her ashes, Dad took to throwing himself to the ground and kissing the earth where the ashes had fallen. Hitherto, he had been among the most reserved of people; the only time I ever saw him express intense physical affection for Mum was at her death, when he showered her cold face with kisses and sobbed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking back now, I can see that Dad&amp;rsquo;s situation was fertile ground for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s to take root in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sandeep Jauhar&amp;rsquo;s new book, &lt;em&gt;My Father&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/em&gt;, is a moving account of his father&amp;rsquo;s illness and eventual death. Like my own father, Jauhar&amp;rsquo;s had lost his wife a few years earlier; like Dad, too, he had a successful career in which intellect played a key role. He cites a 2007 study which suggests there is a strong correlation between loneliness and the development of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s; and another, from 2020, which found that the recently widowed decline mentally three times as quickly as those who have not experienced such wrenching, disabling griefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish I had known about that correlation. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know how easy it would have been to make use of it. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes said that Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s destroys the self. Ultimately, perhaps, it does, if the patient lives long enough to reach the final stage where the disease attacks not just memory but motor function, the ability to undertake such fundamental tasks as swallowing. Dad died before he reached that extremity. I think we must be grateful for that. In one moment of clarity in those last weeks, he described the disease to me as a kind of hollowing out; he said he looked inside himself and found a blackness, as if what remained of memory and the self clung vertiginously to the outer limits of his identity. I think it terrified him. Looking back, though, what feels remarkable is not the loss of self, but its persistence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Memory and the self&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The relationship between memory and the self has long been argued over. Jauhar notes the 18th-century philosopher David Hume&amp;rsquo;s observation in his &lt;em&gt;A Treatise of Human Nature&lt;/em&gt; that &amp;ldquo;Had we no memory, we never should have any notion of causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and effects, which constitute our self or person.&amp;rdquo; Late in life the surrealist film maker Luis Bu&amp;ntilde;uel wrote poignantly in his memoir &lt;em&gt;My Last Breath&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;You have to begin to lose your memory, if only in bits and pieces, to realise that memory is what makes our lives. Life without memory is no life&amp;hellip; Our memory is our coherence, our reason, our feeling, even our action. Without it, we are nothing.&amp;rdquo; But are we only the sum of our own memories? Does the self only have meaning in terms of the interior life? &amp;ldquo;The conventional paradigm about what constitutes a person does not give adequate import to the richness of a human being outside of his cognitive capacities,&amp;rdquo; Jauhar writes. &amp;ldquo;Human beings exist not only in an inner world but also in a public space. It is that space that continues to give meaning to the lives of people living with severe dementia.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an idea also explored in another new book on the subject, Dasha Kiper&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Travellers to Unimaginable Lands&lt;/em&gt;, a psychologically acute and compelling series of case studies exploring the relationship between the carer and the dementia patient. &amp;ldquo;The notion that there is a part of ourselves that is entirely separate from others is most likely a fiction,&amp;rdquo; she writes. There is no &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo; that is distinct from &amp;ldquo;how people see us&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Neurologically speaking, there is no special place in the brain that is hermetically sealed from the influence of other people. Quite the contrary: the self is porous.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A related theme in Kiper&amp;rsquo;s book resonated powerfully with me: the idea that Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s is emotionally and mentally disabling for the carer, as well as the patient. &amp;ldquo;We simply have no cognitive framework that allows for [memory&amp;rsquo;s] absence in others,&amp;rdquo; she writes. &amp;ldquo;Human beings did not evolve to function in isolation, and in fact each person&amp;rsquo;s cognition is dependent on the cognitive faculties of those around them. So when one person&amp;rsquo;s memory is impaired, those close to him or her also become disoriented.&amp;rdquo; That is, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s bends the world to its rhythms and processes. It&amp;rsquo;s quite totalitarian in this regard. Alternate realities &amp;ndash; narratives, perspectives, points of view &amp;ndash; are not viable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Extraordinary intimacies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To accompany a loved one into the horror of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s is to negotiate extraordinary intimacies at the limit of human experience to which you are the only witness. You have to keep privately reminding yourself what is occurring, what has occurred. Your memory of events becomes a kind of private resistance to the disease. But in the public space between you and the patient, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s obliterates you too. Faced, say, with endlessly repeated questions or statements, you can tell the truth and say, &amp;ldquo;We just talked about that&amp;rdquo;. But it won&amp;rsquo;t change the sequence of events. Or you can acquiesce, play the game as it were, and respond to each moment as if it is new to you too. Either way, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s wins. Its reality trumps your reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the end,&amp;rdquo; a neurologist tells Jauhar, &amp;ldquo;all dementias look alike. The whole brain is affected. Patients generally can&amp;rsquo;t speak.&amp;rdquo; But the journey to that end is surely unique &amp;ndash; or as unique as the person for whom you are caring, as unique as your relationship with them. In the same way as my relationship with my dad was not the same as his with each of my siblings, however much common ground we shared, I am sure my experience of his Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s was different, because it was grounded in the deep memory of our prior history. Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s strips away almost everything that is individual. But even when language and memory failed Dad the most, there were still the bare, non-verbal, human things of touch and companionship, comfort and care which we gave him, each as we could: a kind of somatic continuity to counterbalance the strobing discontinuous struggle of surviving as each brief moment of existence flashed past unremarked to make way for the next. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it mattered to him; it felt very much like it did. What does it matter if he didn&amp;rsquo;t remember afterwards?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s, writes David Shenk in his classic study &lt;em&gt;The Forgetting&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;ldquo;is not only a disease, but also a prism through which we can view life in a way not normally available to us&amp;hellip; it forces us to experience death in a way it is rarely otherwise experienced&amp;hellip; It is more painful than many people can even imagine, but it is also perhaps the most poignant of all reminders of why and how human life is so extraordinary. It is our best lens on the meaning of loss.&amp;rdquo; We are social animals. We need community, even if that is a community of two people. We need reciprocity, a sense of the shared moment. But reciprocity requires a mutual understanding. What happens then if there is only one person to understand, to remember?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a historian, as a writer, I think a lot about memory and erasure, memory and loss. Absences in the record. The value of testimony. The sense of my father&amp;rsquo;s life &amp;ndash; all those unshared, unwritten memories flaking away, falling into oblivion in those last months, perhaps years &amp;ndash; was almost palpable. But if the self is not limited to the individual memory, if it is in some senses a shared construct, a shared endeavour, then it is important to rescue what can still be rescued, and not to write off the ends of life, to compound one erasure with another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the 20th century there was a sometimes vituperative debate about the historiography of the Holocaust. Put very crudely, the argument was about whether it is possible even to write history about such a subject: narrative history is inevitably selective, cohering to an argument, and ultimately a kind of falsification, the thinking runs. Critics of this position saw it as an attack on the status of survivor testimony that opened the door to Holocaust revisionism and denial. The Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg&amp;rsquo;s contribution was an essay titled &amp;ldquo;Just One Witness&amp;rdquo;. He begins by citing the extermination of the entire Jewish community in a village in Provence in 1348, in the wake of the Black Death, for which the only evidence now is the written memory of a single survivor. We cannot, as historians, disregard such testimony, he argues, even if there is nothing reciprocal in the record to confirm it. It exists; we must make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That essay, or its core sentiment, has been rattling around my head writing this. For all the grinding bewilderment and exhaustion of those months, there is a kind of privilege to care for someone in these straits. A privilege to travel with someone into such a bleak, strange part of human existence. To travel with them, and bring the last of them back with you. Two people, one supporting the other. One community of two. One witness. One love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Could nuclear fusion save the planet?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6132/could-nuclear-fusion-save-the-planet#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Nuclear fusion is the power source of the sun and the stars. Image credit: Andrey Grinkevich" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/andrey-grinkevich-0x6RTts1jRU-unsplash.jpg" height="1080" alt="A bright yellow sun rises over mountains in Nevada" width="1920"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of excitement lately about harnessing nuclear fusion, the power source of the sun and stars, and so gaining access to limitless green energy. Is it all hype? Well, put it this way. The joke since the 1950s has been that commercial fusion is always 50 years away. Now it appears to be only 30 years away!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what is this promising process, able to produce abundant energy without greenhouse gases? Readers may be more familiar with nuclear fission, the process behind the atomic bomb and nuclear reactors, which involves splitting the core, or &amp;ldquo;nucleus&amp;rdquo;, of a heavy atom, to make lighter nuclei. In nuclear fusion, light nuclei are melded together to make a heavier one. When light nuclei like hydrogen fuse, or heavy nuclei like uranium split, surplus energy gushes out. Pound for pound, a nuclear fuel contains at least a million times as much energy as a &amp;ldquo;chemical fuel&amp;rdquo; like coal or oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why nuclear fusion is so attractive, but let&amp;rsquo;s look at the practicalities. The sun fuses hydrogen into helium, with the by-product being sunlight, but the reaction is far too slow for use on Earth. Instead, the focus has been on gluing together deuterium (a heavy form of hydrogen that is readily available in seawater) with tritium (an even heavier but fast-decaying form, which has to be created by artificial nuclear reactions).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difficulty with fusion is that light nuclei like hydrogen need to be slammed together extremely violently in order to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion, which is ferocious. Such collisions in practice occur only at an extremely high temperature. But, whereas the fusion of hydrogen in the sun requires a temperature of 15 million degrees, the fusion of deuterium and tritium requires a temperature of more than 100 million degrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And herein lies the problem. How do you generate such extraordinary temperatures on Earth without destroying everything in the vicinity?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are two main approaches. One is to confine a super-hot &amp;ldquo;plasma&amp;rdquo; of deuterium and tritium by means of powerful magnetic fields in a machine with a doughnut or &amp;ldquo;torus&amp;rdquo; shape. The other is to compress and heat peppercorn-sized pellets of deuterium and tritium, one after another, by hitting them from all sides with mega-lasers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both fusion methods have scored significant successes of late, which is the reason for the current excitement. In December 2021, at Culham near Oxford, the Joint European Torus (JET) maintained the necessary fusion temperature for 5 seconds. Crucially, 59 million joules of energy more than was put in came out &amp;ndash; enough to boil about 60 kettles. A year later, the US National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California got out 1.1 million joules more than it put in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are undoubtedly milestones on the way to a commercial fusion reactor, but there is a long journey ahead to scale up the technology. JET&amp;rsquo;s successor, the impressively huge International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, funded by 35 countries, is currently under construction in Southern France. But it will be only a test reactor, not a commercial reactor. And if laser-based, or &amp;ldquo;inertial&amp;rdquo;, fusion is ever to be viable, it will need to be able to induce fusion in not just one pellet but several pellets every second.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, it is immensely hard to make a pellet that is perfectly spherical enough that it implodes sufficiently uniformly to create the necessary fusion temperatures. The cost per pellet will also need to come down from its current level of a few hundred thousand dollars to a few tens of cents. The challenges are substantial, but so is the promised reward: unlimited energy from seawater, one of the most abundant resources on the planet, with no greenhouse gases generated, at least not directly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to be clear when it comes to green credentials. It is not quite true that nuclear fusion has no radioactive waste problems. Neutrons escaping from the fusion reactions cannot be confined by magnetic fields, on account of being electrically neutral, and will inevitably make the material of any containment vessel radioactive. Fusion proponents, however, say the radioactivity will not be as long-lived and problematic as from fission reactors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If all goes to plan, a new era of clean and plentiful energy will dawn in the 2050s, with the construction of the first commercial fusion reactors. Unless, of course, some unexpected hitch occurs, flipping that horizon back to its perennial 50-year state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Surrender by Bono</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6131/book-review-surrender-by-bono#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Our reviewer hopes for a second volume" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bono.jpg" height="748" alt="The cover art for 'Surrender' includes a black and white, close-up photo of Bono as a younger man" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story&lt;/strong&gt; (Hutchinson Heinemann) by Bono&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll memoirs are the telling of a miracle. If a musician has succeeded to the point that anybody believes their memoir worth publishing, they have triumphed over the colossal odds that stand against any bunch of earnest, spotty youths, feeling their way around instruments they can barely play, ever amounting to anything much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story related by U2 frontman Bono in &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, as its author understands, is remarkable even by that measure. The chances of Dublin teenagers gathering to make a racket in a suburban kitchen in 1976 becoming, within a decade or so, the biggest rock band in the world were virtually nil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is a series of recollections and digressions attached to 40 songs from U2&amp;rsquo;s catalogue. Though the book is more or less chronological, each chapter feels self-contained: a sketch, a parable, a confession and/or a funny story. Over the course of a long and extraordinary career, Bono has amassed a wealth of anecdotage. He relates his material with the instinctive skill of a born yarn-spinner, and an air of self-deprecating befuddlement that any of this somehow happened. There were, of course, any number of reasons why it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it did. So, Mikhail Gorbachev pitches up on his Dublin doorstep clutching an enormous teddy bear. George W. Bush gives him something of a wigging in the Oval Office. He gets repeatedly out-drunk by Frank Sinatra. He relates his encounters with the elites of entertainment, politics, tech, media and finance with deftly turned character portraits. Rupert Murdoch is &amp;ldquo;a sophisticated thinker, camouflaged by colloquialisms; Australian&amp;rdquo;, Nelson Mandela is &amp;ldquo;a wellspring of joy that defied the weight he carried&amp;rdquo;, Johnny Cash &amp;ldquo;the heavyweight champion of every room he entered except the one that contained June Carter&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is an echo in the latter aper&amp;ccedil;u of another key theme of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;. It is a book about women, although not in the way that memoirs by male rock stars often are. Specifically, it is to a large extent a book about two women. One is Iris Hewson, Bono&amp;rsquo;s mother, who died suddenly when Bono was 14: a recurring motif of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, as it is of U2&amp;rsquo;s catalogue, is Bono grappling with the uncomfortable thought that this tragedy might somehow have catalysed his success. The other is Ali Hewson, Bono&amp;rsquo;s wife: the pair met at school, and married in their early 20s. Bono still sounds like a man touchingly terrified of what might have become of him otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is not merely a great memoir by the usually lackadaisical standards of rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll autobiography. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book about music and politics, family and friendship, pride and ambition, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t wear thin even at nearly 600 pages. Indeed, there are sufficient omissions &amp;ndash; and certainly enough U2 songs &amp;ndash; to warrant a second volume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As someone present at both extraordinary occasions, I was surprised to find little reference to U2&amp;rsquo;s show at Ko&amp;scaron;evo Stadium in Sarajevo in 1997, 18 months after the lifting of the siege of the city, or their three-night stand at Madison Square Garden in New York in 2001, six weeks after 9/11 &amp;ndash; events at which U2&amp;rsquo;s rare gift for channelling a moment triumphed in difficult, volatile circumstances which most bands of their stature might have preferred not to confront.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting stretches of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; are those that reflect on the conundrums and contradictions which arise when one attempts to apply the idealism of rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll to the realities of politics. In both realms, Bono talks about the search for the &amp;ldquo;top-line melody&amp;rdquo;, the irresistible riff that lodges an idea, a sentiment, a mood in people&amp;rsquo;s heads, and sends them away humming it whether they really want to or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To a degree confounding its title, &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; serves as a brisk primer in the art of getting stuff actually done. It turns out to necessitate much the same boneheaded determination and unwillingness to shut up that drive a teenager aboard the boat-train from Dublin to London to spend days schlepping from indifferent promoter to baffled journalist with a demo tape. Though U2&amp;rsquo;s songs have not been short on utopian sloganeering, especially early on, their singer evolved into a pragmatic and effective advocate, and &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is also the story of a political education, as instructed by many of the most influential figures of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did once ask Bono if he entertained any ambitions of political office himself, and suggested that Ireland&amp;rsquo;s largely ceremonial presidency might be suitable; he replied that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to move to a smaller house. Like many of his insights into the absurdity and opportunity of an unlikely life as a mega-celebrity, it&amp;rsquo;s funny because it&amp;rsquo;s true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here for access to the full magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Martin Wolf on the crisis of democratic capitalism</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6130/martin-wolf-on-the-crisis-of-democratic-capitalism#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Martin-Wolf-author-image-sq.jpeg" height="1368" alt="Martin Wolf" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin Wolf is chief economics commentator at the "Financial Times". He was awarded the CBE in 2000 &amp;ldquo;for services to financial journalism&amp;rdquo; and in 2019 won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Gerald Loeb Awards. His latest book is &amp;ldquo;The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism&amp;rdquo; (Allen Lane). Here, he speaks to J. P. O&amp;rsquo; Malley about democratic capitalism and the greatest threats to peace and prosperity in the west.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You define democratic capitalism &amp;ldquo;as the combination of liberal democracy with market capitalism.&amp;rdquo; You believe they have to work together. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you have to look at this historically. In complex organised societies, the dominant form of wealth was land. Those who controlled the land usually also controlled the armies, which meant they controlled power, and the people, the majority of whom worked for them. Over the last two centuries, a market economy became the dominant form for creating wealth. In this economic system, which replaced feudalism, a new capitalist elite was born in which everybody had a right to try to become a capitalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that sense, it was egalitarian. Obviously, though, most people didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;make it&amp;rdquo;. But we eventually ended up with universal suffrage and democracy &amp;hellip; Crucially, capitalism created the social and economic conditions that [helped produce] a society in which people have equal value and equal merit. I believe democracy prevents capitalism from becoming a predatory plutocracy. Just as a market economy prevents a state from becoming an autocracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t international trade and capital flows (the movement of money for investment and trade) pose a serious challenge to this system?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the core tensions in democratic capitalism is that democracy is bound up with a territorial jurisdiction. Namely: you are a citizen of one country to which you are most attached, and to which you pay your taxes. But from its beginning, capitalism has had a transnational aspect. Because market opportunities exist across the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The level of prosperity that most of us now expect demands a very high level of international trade. Moreover, an essential part of international commerce is foreign investment, which allows capital to spread out across the world. A combination of trade and foreign investment has accelerated big social and economic changes in western societies, particularly with regards to deindustrialisation. This has seen the labour force in industry shrinking everywhere, though this is mainly because we can produce more and more goods with fewer and fewer people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the biggest source of instability to the global economy in recent years has been capital flows. Particularly in the uncontrolled financial sector, which was really what was behind the global financial crisis, which had a devastating long-term impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I believe we can still sustain a liberal democratic capitalist system, while having open economies. In fact, there&amp;rsquo;s no real alternative for us. An open international economy is going to be beneficial for most of humanity. It gives tremendous opportunities for development. And we&amp;rsquo;ve got to try and do better to manage the consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your latest book, &amp;ldquo;The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism&amp;rdquo;, proposes ways to beat tax dodging by multinational corporations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tax reform is one of the big issues. We need to have land [value] taxes [taxing the rental value of land]. They&amp;rsquo;re very easy to impose actually. A lot of the value created by the corporate sector, and by investment more broadly, ends up in land values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With regards to corporation tax, my view is that there is a legitimate case for allowing investment spending to be deducted from the tax base, because you want corporations to invest. But the rate of tax on profits which are uninvested should align with the top income tax. When you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with internationally mobile factors of production, which are very difficult to tax easily in an open mobile economy, where capital moves quickly, then the obvious thing to do is to reach international agreements. This will lead to further efforts to eliminate tax havens. But, more importantly, to agree on a common basis for tax, which could help raise substantially more revenue from corporations and their owners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also address the challenges faced by the World Trade Organization since it was founded in 1995. Why has cooperation not worked out as planned?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, the WTO was built around the idea that it would be possible to create a set of rules that governed all of world trade. That became more difficult, however, as the world started to divide into blocks, with the west on the one side, and China on the other. That makes it very difficult to run global trade rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of this became very politically sensitive because globalisation had not benefited everyone. That has led to a political backlash, particularly in the United States, where the welfare state is weak. The policy solution for the US has been to become more protectionist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What should have happened over the last fifteen years was a way for the west to bring the Chinese regime closer to our system. It was not impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it never happened. So we now have this rather unique problem, where we have this huge economic player &amp;ndash; China &amp;ndash; which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to fit into the underlying principles of liberal democratic capitalism, as we understand it. The Americans see this in geopolitical terms. And if you add those two things together, the WTO ceases to function, to cover all of global trade. The global order underpinning global capitalism from 1990 to 2007 has now gone. That is obvious. The question remains: how do we manage this process of reversal?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest threats to peace and prosperity in the west today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no doubt we are going through an enormously challenging period in global affairs. The war in Ukraine has created economic chaos. We also have the relationship between China and Russia and the adversarial relationship between China and the United States. It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to predict how it is all going to end up. The outcomes are potentially very dangerous. Namely: extreme global nuclear war. I&amp;rsquo;m not forecasting that. But it&amp;rsquo;s clearly a threat that is very real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the west needs to protect its political system and its economies. That means basic economic and military security. It also requires some reconsiderations of our trade relations with the rest of the world, particularly with China. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we should stop trade altogether with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, we have to be sure that a Chinese influence does not infringe on our own freedoms or interfere with our own institutions. Managing relationships with rival powers is also important. The west has failed with Russia. We cannot fail with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the climate crisis? How does the west&amp;rsquo;s relationship with China factor in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have an obligation to look after our shared planet. For the first time in history, human beings are reshaping the planet in very dramatic ways. Notably, the extreme damage that is being done to the climate system, the oceans and the biosphere. China is also part of that. We cannot solve these problems without China. It is, after all, the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. China is probably more responsible for overfishing than any other country too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But we have to compete and cooperate, while avoiding actually conflicting with China. Historically, relationships like this have often, but not always, ended up in war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relations between the United States and China are now really bad. Particularly from the American side, which has become quite paranoid. That is stupendously dangerous. And if we don&amp;rsquo;t manage that, all the rest of the arguments I present in my book will become irrelevant, because we won&amp;rsquo;t have a world that is worth living in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The paralysing pessimism of Critical Race Theory</title>

Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Malik.jpg" height="1026" alt="'Open Casket', a 2016 painting by Dana Schutz" width="1368"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Black people are the magical faces at the bottom of society&amp;rsquo;s well. Even the poorest whites, those who must live their lives only a few levels above, gain their self-esteem by gazing down on us. Surely, they must know that their deliverance depends on letting down their ropes. Only by working together is escape possible. Over time, many reach out, but most simply watch, mesmerized into maintaining their unspoken commitment to keeping us where we are, at whatever cost to them, as to us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is the arresting image that opens Derrick Bell&amp;rsquo;s 1992 book &lt;em&gt;Faces at the Bottom of the Well&lt;/em&gt;. It is a work of existential despair, but, for Bell, the only realistic way of thinking about the place in which African Americans find themselves. Racism, he wrote, &amp;ldquo;is an integral, permanent and indestructible component of this society&amp;rdquo;. Black people &amp;ldquo;will never gain full equality&amp;rdquo;. Even &amp;ldquo;those herculean efforts we hail as successful will produce no more than temporary &amp;lsquo;peaks of progress&amp;rsquo;, short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance as racial patterns adapt in ways that maintain white dominance. This is a hard-to-accept fact that all history verifies.&amp;rdquo; Not to accept that fact was to do great mental and emotional harm. Since &amp;ldquo;racial equality is&amp;hellip; not a realistic goal&amp;rdquo;, to be &amp;ldquo;constantly aiming for a status that is unobtainable in a perilously racist America&amp;rdquo; would lead only to &amp;ldquo;frustration and despair&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Derrick Bell is not a household name. Yet few people have been more important in shaping contemporary thinking about race, particularly in the United States. From Barack Obama to Ta-Nehisi Coates, leading black thinkers have paid tribute to Bell&amp;rsquo;s inspiration. There are not many legal scholars in recent memory, wrote Michelle Alexander, the influential author of &lt;em&gt;The New Jim Crow&lt;/em&gt;, who &amp;ldquo;have [had] a greater impact on racial justice thought and advocacy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell is the godfather of what is now called Critical Race Theory (CRT). Beginning as a movement within American legal studies that brought a postmodern sensibility to thinking about the law, CRT developed into a critique of the liberal &amp;ldquo;civil rights&amp;rdquo; approach to tackling racism, a critique nurtured by a hostility to universalism, humanism and the Enlightenment. &amp;ldquo;Enlightenment-style Western democracy is&amp;hellip; the source of black people&amp;rsquo;s subordination,&amp;rdquo; wrote Richard Delgado, one of the movement&amp;rsquo;s founders, because &amp;ldquo;racism and enlightenment [sic] are the same thing&amp;rdquo;. Many of the themes that CRT champions &amp;ndash; the centrality of race, rather than of class, to discussions about social issues; the view of racism as a problem of whiteness; the significance of &amp;ldquo;white privilege&amp;rdquo;; the disparagement of the Enlightenment legacy; the politicisation of identity &amp;ndash; became much more widely suffused in 21st-century debates about race and racism, moulding thinkers from Ibram X. Kendi to Robin DiAngelo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell&amp;rsquo;s pessimism, and the arguments underpinning Critical Race Theory, were shaped by the specific conditions of America: the history of slavery, the depth of Jim Crow culture in the South, as well as disenchantment with the limited change in the material conditions of black people&amp;rsquo;s lives brought about by the civil rights movement. But these arguments have since become influential well beyond the US. Across the globe, debates about race are often unreflectingly shaped by ideas and movements originating in the US, whether Black Power in the 1960s or the contemporary culture wars. That influence, underpinned by America&amp;rsquo;s economic, political and cultural weight, makes it important that we look even more carefully at those ideas and developments, unpack the myths and unpick the arguments. In understanding the American debates we understand more also about the debates beyond the US, including in our own country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The godfather of Critical Race Theory&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Born in Pittsburgh in 1930, Bell attended the University of Pittsburgh&amp;rsquo;s law school, the only black graduate in his class, before becoming an attorney in the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. As part of the civil rights assault on Jim Crow, Bell supervised the desegregation of more than 300 schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Desegregation often led to white flight, as white families moved elsewhere rather than send their children to integrated institutions. The result was that many desegregated schools remained segregated, not by formal procedure but through informal practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This conundrum led Bell to question whether it was truly possible to rid society of racism. He had taken his first step on the road to racial pessimism. In 1969, Bell joined Harvard Law School. At the end of the decade, he published perhaps his most celebrated paper, challenging the conventional view of Brown v Board of Education, the famous 1954 Supreme Court case that invalidated state-sanctioned segregated schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Desegregation was not the consequence of a moral desire for racial equality, Bell insisted, but a pragmatic response to political needs, a recognition that segregation hindered &amp;ldquo;America&amp;rsquo;s struggle with communist countries to win the hearts and minds of emerging third world people&amp;rdquo; and was &amp;ldquo;a barrier to further industrialization in the South&amp;rdquo;. Racial progress only occurred when it aligned with white interests, and when those interests changed, any attachment to equality was ditched. Whites, he wrote, &amp;ldquo;simply cannot envision the personal responsibility and the potential sacrifice&amp;hellip; that true equality for blacks will require.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In reality, desegregation was the product of many developments. The American authorities were certainly worried about the image created by Jim Crow and wanted to minimise its propaganda value to the Soviet Union. Desegregation was also a response to the long struggle, not just by black Americans, against racism. The recognition of the immorality of American apartheid played its role, too. And the overthrow of Jim Crow, while it did not bring about the kind of equality African Americans hoped for, nevertheless helped reset the moral dial. The attitude of most Americans to issues from equality to interracial marriage was very different by the end of the century than it had been in the era of Jim Crow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Bell&amp;rsquo;s view, however, because racism was ineradicable, not only would antiracist action &amp;ldquo;not lead to transcendent change&amp;rdquo; but it &amp;ldquo;may indeed, despite our best efforts, be of more help to the system we despise than to the victims of that system whom we are trying to help.&amp;rdquo; And yet, he insisted, antiracists must continue struggling against racism even as they acknowledged that there could be no prospect of success. They had to combine &amp;ldquo;recognition of the futility of action&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;the unalterable conviction that something must be done, that action must be taken&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The well of despair&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Few who were inspired by Bell&amp;rsquo;s work tumbled as far as he did into the well of despair, but pessimism has nevertheless shaped much contemporary thinking about race. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time we ask ourselves: What if Bell was right?&amp;rdquo;, Michelle Alexander reflected in a foreword to a new edition of &lt;em&gt;Faces at the Bottom of the Well&lt;/em&gt; in 2018. &amp;ldquo;What if justice for the dark faces at &amp;lsquo;the bottom of the well&amp;rsquo; can&amp;rsquo;t actually be won in the United States? &amp;hellip; What if racism is permanent? What if?&amp;rdquo; It is a pessimism rooted in many trends: the left&amp;rsquo;s disenchantment with the Enlightenment and with the working class, the degradation of the universalist tradition, the institutionalisation of neoliberalism, the enervation of the labour movement. Like Bell himself, Alexander insists that &amp;ldquo;accepting the permanence of racism in this country does not mean accepting racism&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet challenging racism while at the same time believing it to be ineradicable has inevitably shaped the character of antiracism today. It has prompted a shift from campaigns for material change to demands for symbolic gestures and representational fairness. After all, if racism is permanent, and attempts to eliminate it futile, then antiracism becomes reduced to little more than a kind of public performance or finger-wagging at white people to make them feel guilty or, at best, an attempt to make the unfairness a little less unfair. &amp;ldquo;These days&amp;rdquo;, as influential sociologist and cultural theorist Paul Gilroy has observed, identity too often &amp;ldquo;ceases to be an ongoing process of self-making and social interaction&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;becomes instead a thing to be possessed and displayed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also becomes a thing to be guarded and policed. For, if racism is permanent and ineradicable, then combatting it cannot be about winning equality but can only be about carving out a space within which one can assert a degree of power and autonomy. Hence the demand to &amp;ldquo;Stay in your lane&amp;rdquo;. Perhaps no issue expresses this better than the controversy over &amp;ldquo;cultural appropriation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the evening of 24 August 1955, 14-year-old African American Emmett Till went with some friends to Bryant&amp;rsquo;s Grocery in Money, Mississippi. Living in Chicago, he had come to Mississippi to visit relatives. He walked into the shop and bought two cents&amp;rsquo; worth of bubble gum. Witnesses claimed that Till flirted with the white shop owner, Carolyn Bryant. Four days after the alleged incident, in the dead of night, her husband Roy Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam, who had been out of town on a trucking job, drove to the house where Till was staying and kidnapped the boy. They beat him up and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and dumping the body in the Tallahatchie River. The following month, an all-white jury found Bryant and Milam not guilty of murder. Protected against double jeopardy, the two men admitted in a 1956 interview with &lt;em&gt;Look&lt;/em&gt; magazine that they had tortured and murdered the boy. They received $4,000 for their story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Till&amp;rsquo;s mother Mamie Elizabeth Till-Mobley insisted on an open casket at her son&amp;rsquo;s funeral to expose to the world the savagery of lynchings. She invited photographers to capture the mutilated body. &amp;ldquo;I wanted the world to see what they did to my baby,&amp;rdquo; she said. Fifty thousand people saw Emmett Till&amp;rsquo;s disfigured body as it lay in its open casket in church. Millions more saw the photographs in &lt;em&gt;Jet&lt;/em&gt; magazine, causing shock and outrage. Emmett Till, and the haunting photographs of his broken body, became an indelible, almost ineffable, symbol for the burgeoning civil rights movement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than half a century later, the murder of Emmett Till generated another kind of controversy &amp;ndash; a debate over who should be allowed to depict black pain and for what reason. The 2022 biopic &lt;em&gt;Till&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Chinonye Chukwu, faced questions about whether art should be &amp;ldquo;made from the trauma of American anti-Blackness&amp;rdquo;, as one British reviewer put it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who owns black pain?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five years earlier this question had been posed even more sharply when the artist Dana Schutz painted &amp;ldquo;Open Casket&amp;rdquo;, an image of Till in his coffin, drawn from the photographs. The painting was included in the 2017 Whitney Biennial Exhibition in New York. Many objected to a white painter depicting such a traumatic moment in black history. The British artist Hannah Black organized a petition to have the work destroyed. &amp;ldquo;Although Schutz&amp;rsquo;s intention may be to present white shame,&amp;rdquo; her open letter read, &amp;ldquo;this shame is not correctly represented as a painting of a dead Black boy by a white artist.&amp;rdquo; According to Black, &amp;ldquo;the subject matter is not Schutz&amp;rsquo;s; white free speech and white creative freedom have been founded on the constraint of others, and are not natural rights.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few months later, the novelist Zadie Smith stood in front of the painting with her children. Schutz&amp;rsquo;s work did not impress her &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel very much&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but she pondered whether she, a biracial British woman, was deemed black enough for the subject matter to be hers? And what of her children? Their father is white: &amp;ldquo;by the old racial classifications of America, they are &amp;lsquo;quadroons&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Are my children too white to engage with black suffering?&amp;rdquo;, Smith wondered. &amp;ldquo;How black is black enough?&amp;rdquo; And what about Hannah Black herself? She, like Smith, is a British biracial woman. Is she &amp;ldquo;black enough to write this letter&amp;rdquo;, demanding the painting be destroyed, Smith mused. &amp;ldquo;Who owns black pain?&amp;rdquo; Smith was attempting both to untangle the absurdities of racial categories and to push back the inclination to evaluate moral rights by virtue of the group to which individuals are deemed to belong &amp;ndash; a practice inextricably bound with racial thinking, and its horrors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cultural appropriation has been defined as the &amp;ldquo;unauthorized use of another culture&amp;rsquo;s dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc&amp;rdquo; and as &amp;ldquo;an expression of privilege&amp;rdquo; which exposes that while &amp;ldquo;people of color are forced to adopt elements of mainstream white culture, white people can sample at the buffet of other cultures at their leisure, picking and choosing what they wish to consume.&amp;rdquo; The first quote is from law professor Susan Scafidi, the second from sociologist Nicki Lisa Cole, both based in the US, but these are common definitions in and outside of America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In such discussions, every culture is viewed as a fixed, self-contained unit, every culture separated from every other by a sharp discontinuity, every culture possessing a specific set of traits and forms. But what does it mean for music or a cuisine &amp;ndash; or &amp;ldquo;pain&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; to &amp;ldquo;belong&amp;rdquo; to a culture? And who gives permission for someone from another culture to use such cultural forms?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are few answers to such questions because the debate about cultural appropriation is less about ownership than about gatekeeping &amp;ndash; about the tacit rules that define social boundaries, and the legitimacy of carrying cultural baggage across those boundaries. Every society has its gatekeepers, whose role it is to protect certain institutions, maintain the privileges of particular groups and cordon off some beliefs from challenge. Gatekeepers shield not the marginalised but the powerful. Racism itself is a form of gatekeeping, a means of denying racialised groups equal rights, access and opportunities. The policing of cultural appropriation is no different, though the polarities have been reversed, and it is executed in the name of antiracism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many critics of cultural appropriation insist that they are opposed not to cultural engagement, but to racism. They want to protect marginalised cultures and to ensure that such cultures speak for themselves and are not simply seen through the eyes of more privileged groups. They want also to ensure that it is not white people but minorities that profit from the promotion of their culture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is true that cultural engagement does not take place on a level playing field but is shaped by racism and inequality. Racism ensured, for instance, that the great black pioneers of rock &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll rarely received their due, whereas many white artists, from Elvis Presley onwards, were feted as cultural icons. Yet, as poet, writer and activist Amiri Baraka has observed, the issue here is not that of cultural appropriation at all. &amp;ldquo;If the Beatles tell me that they learned everything they know from Blind Willie [Johnson]&amp;rdquo;, he told the cultural critic Leonard Schwartz in a radio discussion, &amp;ldquo;I want to know why Blind Willie is still running an elevator in Jackson, Mississippi. It&amp;rsquo;s that kind of inequality that is abusive, not the actual appropriation of culture because that&amp;rsquo;s normal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baraka is highlighting the distinction between campaigns that seek to transform the material conditions of African Americans and campaigns for &amp;ldquo;recognition&amp;rdquo; or for the policing of racial boundaries. The campaigns against cultural appropriation expose how the first has been abandoned for the second. Preventing the Beatles from drawing on the work of Blind Willie Johnson would have done little to improve black people&amp;rsquo;s lives. It would not have overthrown Jim Crow laws in the 1950s. It would not rid America of discrimination in the labour market today. Nor will preventing Dana Schutz &amp;ldquo;profiting&amp;rdquo; from painting Emmett Till protect the Emmett Tills of today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equally troubling is that a campaign such as that against Schutz&amp;rsquo;s work contains, as the American critic Adam Shatz has observed, an &amp;ldquo;implicit disavowal that acts of radical sympathy, and imaginative identification, are possible across racial lines&amp;rdquo;. African-American history, Shatz insists, following in the path of Frederick Douglass and WEB Du Bois and James Baldwin, &amp;ldquo;is American history&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;confronting it [is] a common burden&amp;rdquo;. That is precisely the perspective that has been lost through the retreat from the universalist standpoint.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As novelist Kamila Shamsie pointed out, in response to a different controversy over cultural appropriation, losing this universal standpoint is a dangerous thing. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;You &amp;ndash; other &amp;ndash; are unimaginable&amp;rsquo; is a far more problematic attitude than &amp;lsquo;You are imaginable&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an edited excerpt from Kenan Malik&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &amp;ldquo;Not So Black and White&amp;rdquo; (C Hurst &amp;amp; Co), printed in the summer 2023 edition of New Humanist. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe now to access the full magazine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br/>
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan’s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br/>
“How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!” — Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br/>
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung’s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br/>
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you’ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind “Hiding the Elephant Puzzle” comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini’s greatest illusions, you’ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
