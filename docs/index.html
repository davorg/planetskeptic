<p class="lead">That Washington Post series on arch-racist Ales Hrdlicka has really stung the Smithsonian. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/20/smithsonian-secretary-lonnie-bunch-human-remains/">Secretary of the Smithsonian has written an op-ed</a> apologizing for its history.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anthropologist Ales Hrdlicka served as the head of the Smithsonian’s physical anthropology division from 1903 to 1941, when the majority of the human remains in our collections were obtained. During Hrdlicka’s four decades at the institution, he oversaw the acquisition of hundreds of human brains and thousands of other remains. The overwhelming majority of these remains were taken without the consent of the deceased or their family members, and Hrdlicka took particular interest in the remains of Indigenous people and people of color to undergird his search for scientific evidence of white superiority.</p>
<p>It was abhorrent and dehumanizing work, and it was carried out under the Smithsonian’s name. As secretary of the Smithsonian, I condemn these past actions and apologize for the pain caused by Hrdlicka and others at the institution who acted unethically in the name of science, regardless of the era in which their actions occurred.</p>
<p>I recognize, too, that the Smithsonian is responsible both for the original work of Hrdlicka and others who subscribed to his beliefs, and for the failure to return the remains he collected to descendant communities in the decades since.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s a good start, but so far it&#8217;s just words. Tell me what you are <em>doing</em>, because that&#8217;s where the excuses get weak. The material changes so far are that they have repatriated a few thousand remains, they have formed a task force, and they promise future policy changes.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our forthcoming policy will finally recognize these remains not as objects to be studied but as human beings to be honored. It is a long-overdue shift, and I regret that human bodies were ever treated with such disrespect at our institution.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I may suggest an alternative response: reverse the obligations. Assume every single piece of flesh or bone <em>must</em> be traced to their origins as quickly as possible and returned to their peoples; the priority is to get rid of <em>all</em> of it. If anything is to be retained, someone must be named as responsible for the objects, and must have a specific scientific plan for extracting information from them in the near future, and then returned. Right now, everything is backwards, where we just assume if someone has a bunch of bones in a barrel, well, it <em>belongs</em> to them, even if all they can say is a vague assurance that it&#8217;s in a &#8220;teaching collection.&#8221; I always wonder what they plan to teach with them.</p>
<p>If you want to claim something is scientifically valuable, the onus is on <em>you</em> to justify that claim.</p>

<p>These are the speakers at a <a href="https://flatearthfestivals.com/flatoberfest2023/">Flat Earth Conference</a>, which is a thing I can scarcely believe exists in the 21st century.</p>
<p>But then, I thought about it, and realized that from the perspective of a casino owner, these are precisely the group of people I&#8217;d want staying at my gambling establishment. Roll out the red carpet! I&#8217;d give these people all kinds of special rates, knowing that I&#8217;d be able to extract plenty of profit from some of the most confidently innumerate people on the globe.</p>
<p>You know, I&#8217;ve been to Vegas a couple of times, and I&#8217;ve stayed in casinos a few times, because they generally have cheap room rates…but I&#8217;ve never in my life placed a bet at one. I&#8217;m probably the antithesis of their desired clientele, while the prospect of a bunch of flat-earthers has the venue owners drooling. Unfortunately for their bottom line, I don&#8217;t think many people will show up for this specific event.</p>

<p>The only omission is the absence of coaches, but maybe that&#8217;s OK. Coaches don&#8217;t actually make any decisions or contribute to academic life, they are off to the side, grinning happily as they skim off millions of dollars, with which the trustees and donors fill their pockets.</p>

Credit: 10 Downing Street/Open Government Licence" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bojo.jpg" height="696" alt="Boris Johnson signs the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement" width="1024"></strong></p> <p><strong>Resign,</strong><em> 13th century: To give up an office or to relinquish a position to another person</em></p> <p>Resigning has become quite fashionable. It has its advantages: it can seem honourable and principled or even powerful enough to wash away perceived or actual faults and misdeeds. However, if it takes too long, the person leaving office may carry the odour of delay: &ldquo;clinging on till the inevitable&rdquo;, people cry.</p> <p>The most notable resignation of late has been that of Boris Johnson, who, not content with one resignation, has done it twice. Some suspect that the second departure was a way of weaselling out of facing the music. Like Macavity the Mystery Cat in T. S. Eliot&rsquo;s <em>Old Possum&rsquo;s Book of Practical Cats</em>, he &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t there&rdquo; when the House of Commons finally voted on a report that said he had misled the House.</p> <p>The word has been in use on these islands since the 13th century, a time when Norman French and Middle English were beginning to blend. The original meaning in Norman French was the idea of giving up on sin rather than chucking in your job. We can play in our minds with the idea that when people shout &ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; they half-mean &ldquo;Stop sinning!&rdquo;</p> <p>Shakespeare grasped the drama of the moment in the first of his history plays, when usurper Bolingbroke says to Richard II, &ldquo;Are you contented to resign the crown?&rdquo; And the wavering Richard replies: &ldquo;Ay no; no ay.&rdquo; How many others since Shakespeare&rsquo;s Richard have thought such thoughts?</p> <p>There is also a parallel meaning to the word: where we are &ldquo;resigned&rdquo; to our fate or situation. There&rsquo;s an example of this in Henry Fielding&rsquo;s Tom Jones (1749): &ldquo;He should insist on the most resigned Obedience from his Daughter.&rdquo; If you know the story, you&rsquo;ll understand why we might say, tongue in cheek, &ldquo;Best of luck with that, Squire!&rdquo;</p> <p>At the time of writing, several Conservative MPs have resigned along with Boris Johnson, though one &ndash; Nadine Dorries &ndash; seems to have gone for the Richard II method. We are in what we might call the &ldquo;Ay no; no ay&rdquo; moment. It&rsquo;s nice to see that Ms Dorries might have been inspired by Shakespeare. She was the culture minister, after all.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

Many studies have highlighted the importance of factors such as age, weight (or body mass index) and existing conditions to an individual&rsquo;s risk of infection, hospitalisation and death. But it also turned out that the picture was more complex.</p> <p>From the earliest days of the pandemic, there was an explosion of large studies trying to understand how our genetics might help explain the virus&rsquo;s diverse and often mysterious disease trajectory. One such effort was from a global consortium of doctors and scientists known as GenOMICC, which had already been looking into genetic determinants of severe illness following infection.</p> <p>Over the first two years of the pandemic, tens of thousands of samples were taken from critically ill Covid patients, many from intensive care units. Analyses were then conducted to try to identify genes that might be associated with the worst patient outcomes. Severe responses to Covid-19 often involve a total breakdown in normal immune signalling. This can result in a dangerous influx of normally helpful immune cells and proteins into the sites of infection (lungs, in this case). It is therefore not surprising that many of the 49 genetic variants identified as being associated with critical illness from Covid code for proteins involved in immunity.</p> <p>In May, in the journal <em>Nature</em>, GenOMICC reported finding links between severe Covid and a wide range of genes and their patterns of activity. Encouragingly, some are already known targets of existing drugs that could potentially be repurposed for treatment of severe Covid. The report also identified an association between severe illness and multiple genes involved in how the virus actually enters the patient&rsquo;s cells. These findings provide useful insights into how an individual&rsquo;s route to infection, as well as their biological response to it, may determine why some people get critically ill with Covid, whilst close to a third of us have no symptoms at all.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

All are in Africa and Latin America: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Mali, Sudan, Venezuela and Cameroon.</p> <p>Sudan&rsquo;s inclusion on the list is notable because the research for the report was done in 2022 &ndash; before the outbreak of violence between the military junta and the rebel Rapid Support Forces that has killed thousands and displaced millions since April.</p> <p>Already in 2022, a third of Sudan&rsquo;s population required aid amid a political and economic crisis and the impacts of climate change, according to the NRC, but less than half of the required funding was received. What&rsquo;s more, the country was hosting over a million refugees from other countries, many of whom have now had to flee again.</p> <p>There was a spike in coverage of the crisis after the outbreak of war this year. Data from Google Trends, which gives an indication of how much the search engine&rsquo;s hundreds of millions of users are following a topic, shows that searches for &ldquo;Sudan&rdquo; rose quickly in April. But by May they had more or less returned to previous levels, even though the conflict and accompanying atrocities are far from over. By contrast, searches for &ldquo;Ukraine&rdquo; remain elevated nearly 18 months after the war began.</p> <p>The UK has created no safe passage for refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan. Home Secretary Suella Braverman suggested that those wanting to seek asylum in Britain could present themselves to the UN Refugee Agency for resettlement, but such a scheme doesn&rsquo;t exist. Neighbouring countries, particularly Egypt and Chad, are hosting hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees alone, with the potential for instability to spill over.</p> <p>The UK and other governments could and should be doing so much more, from creating asylum routes to providing humanitarian aid and engaging in serious diplomatic efforts. But far from that, the UK has actually cut aid to many of these neglected crises in recent years.</p> <p>&ldquo;None of these countries is neglected by accident,&rdquo; the report authors write. &ldquo;The powerful response to the suffering inflicted by the war in Ukraine has shown that neglect is in fact a choice. Where there is the will, political action can be impactful and swift, funding vast, and media coverage extensive.&rdquo; Humanitarian compassion cannot be based on geopolitics. While there is a limit to what we can do as individuals, we urge our readers to keep learning about these crises and pushing for action wherever possible.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

This means that adults are considered to have given their consent to be a potential organ donor after their death unless they specifically say they don&rsquo;t want to be.</p> <p>The change will likely save many lives. Ten to 15 patients die each year in Northern Ireland while awaiting a transplant. Currently, there are around 150 people on the waiting list. The new law is named after six-year-old D&aacute;ith&iacute; Mac Gabhann, who has been waiting for a heart transplant for five years. His family fought for the change in law, alongside campaigners who pointed out that 90 per cent of people in Northern Ireland supported organ donation but only half were signed up to the Organ Donor Register.</p> <p>The trend towards opt-out across the UK mirrors the rest of Europe. Most of the continent has now shifted to an opt-out system. However, when it comes to advancing organ donations, the evidence shows that opt-out legislation is often insufficient on its own.</p> <p>Public education is key. Under soft opt-out systems, like those in the UK, family members can intervene to block a donation after a relative&rsquo;s death &ndash; this often happens because families aren&rsquo;t sure what their relative wanted, so it&rsquo;s important that people talk about their beliefs and intentions. But above all, systems to identify opportunities for donations and good matches with patients need to be improved. That could take many forms, including new technologies. The National Institute for Health and Care Research and the NHS are helping to fund the development of a system using artificial intelligence. Researchers believe that AI could prove more effective than surgeons at examining donor organs and assessing their suitability for transplant.</p> <p>The team estimates that the new system could result in up to 200 more patients receiving kidney transplants and 100 more receiving liver transplants every year in the UK.</p> <p>The move towards opt-out organ donation is a positive sign of societal progress. Increasing the availability of organs for donation will only become more important as our populations age, meaning that a lower percentage of organs will be suitable for transplant. Demand always outstrips supply, and we must carry on doing what we can, whether through changing legislation, public awareness or technological progress.</p> <p>Organ donation saves lives, and anything that helps one more organ reach a patient in need is a change worth fighting for.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

The College is a non-profit community youth development organisation that uses magic to offer hope to young people in and around Cape Town.  They do incredible work and for the past two years I have been working with them and Vanishing Inc (the largest magic retailer in the world ) to produce a unique  magic booklet and custom deck of cards for budding magicians. </p>

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->
