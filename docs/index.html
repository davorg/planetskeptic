<p class="lead">Not even the ones who seem nice and kindly. They&#8217;ve all got a dogma driving them. <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/pope-francis-blasts-gender-ideology-as-one-of-the-most-dangerous-ideological-colonizations">Pope Francis has said some stupid things</a>, as the Daily Wire gleefully reports.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>“Gender ideology, today, is one of the most dangerous ideological colonizations,” Francis said. “Why is it dangerous? Because it blurs differences and the value of men and women. All humanity is the tension of differences. It is to grow through the tension of differences. The question of gender is diluting the differences and making the world the same, all dull, all alike, and that is contrary to the human vocation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What is &#8220;gender ideology&#8221;? Because, near as I can tell, it&#8217;s simply that all people are of equal worth, no matter what their sex or gender or sexual preferences. Gender is not an ideology. It&#8217;s just who people are.</p>
<p>He thinks it&#8217;s dangerous because it blurs the differences and value of men and women. I think men and women are of equal value, so &#8220;blurring&#8221; doesn&#8217;t matter. What differences in value is he concerned about? Also, I&#8217;m not seeing any blurring of <em>differences</em>, I&#8217;m seeing a celebration of differences, where people with non-mainstream ideas are being allowed to flourish.</p>
<p>What are these &#8220;tensions&#8221; he&#8217;s talking about, and how does the &#8220;question of gender&#8221; (what question?) dilute them? Diminishing differences, requiring everyone to fit into one of precisely two molds, is what would make the world dull and all alike. Would it make the world less dull if we told all the florists you&#8217;re only allowed red roses and white lilies? It would certainly increase some tensions.</p>
<p>Also, a Catholic pope does not get to complain about ideological colonization. Catholicism is definitely an ideology, unlike gender, and has been on a campaign of forced ideological conversion for over a thousand years. It&#8217;s ironic to complain about &#8220;ideological conversion&#8221;, but I guess that only applies to imaginary ideologies he doesn&#8217;t like.</p>

<p class="lead">I was asked by a <a href="https://twitter.com/YTGGFI">friend</a> to take a look at this paper which he was surprised to see in a science journal. It&#8217;s a weird and unconvincing paper, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550830720300926?via%3Dihub">Case report of instantaneous resolution of juvenile macular degeneration blindness after proximal intercessory prayer</a>. It&#8217;s actually a case of rummaging around in old medical files in order to report a &#8220;miracle&#8221; in 1972.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the story: an 18 year old girl lost her vision in 1959 over the course of a few months, with no identified cause. She was diagnosed with 7/200 vision, attended a school for the blind, and lived as a blind person for 12 years. Then, even more suddenly, her vision recovered fully after her husband prayed for her.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the couple went to bed later than normal (after midnight), her husband performed a hurried spiritual devotional practice (reading two Bible verses) and got on his knees to pray. She describes that they both began to cry as he began to pray, with a hand on her shoulder while she laid on the bed, and with great feeling and boldness he prayed: “Oh, God! You can restore […] eyesight tonight, Lord. I know You can do it! And I pray You will do it tonight.” At the close of the prayer, his wife opened her eyes and saw her husband kneeling in front of her, which was her first clear visual perception after almost 13 years of blindness.</p></blockquote>
<p>An examination in 2001 revealed that she had 20/40 vision, and that her retinas looked normal.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t debunk this account, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for. I could speculate about possible ways the story is misleading us, but we know nothing about the causes of the blindness or its cure, we don&#8217;t even know that there was a physical basis for the blindness, and I&#8217;m not going to diagnose an old medical condition &#8212; that&#8217;s what the authors of the paper are doing. All we&#8217;ve got are old records, and modern evidence that she can see, and no way to trace the actual history of her vision. It&#8217;s an anecdote. Maybe she was actually cured by a miracle! Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no way to analyze what actually happened.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m skeptical that prayer is actually effective, though. This woman was devout, came from a very religious family and community, and you&#8217;re telling me that the onset of blindness did not trigger a flurry of intense prayers from the woman, her family, and her church? Was that the first time her husband begged his god to restore her sight? It&#8217;s awfully hard to believe that something that was certainly done to no effect for years can be assigned a causal role in her abrupt recovery. But OK, I just have to shrug and say that&#8217;s some story.</p>
<p>How did it get published in a science journal? Well, it&#8217;s not a science journal, for one thing. It got published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/explore"><i>Explore</i></a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>EXPLORE: The Journal of Science &#038; Healing addresses the scientific principles behind, and applications of, evidence-based healing practices from a wide variety of sources, including conventional, alternative, and cross-cultural medicine. It is an interdisciplinary journal that explores the healing arts, consciousness, spirituality, eco-environmental issues, and basic science as all these fields relate to health.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those alternative journals with standards so wide open the editors&#8217; brains have fallen out. I&#8217;ll also note that the paper concludes with an empty statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>The PIP [proximal intercessory prayer] may have been associated with a response in the ANS [autonomic nervous system] of the patient. However, research on the potential for PIP to affect the ANS and/or reverse vision loss associated with JMD is limited. Findings from this report and others like it warrant investment in future research to ascertain whether and how PIP experiences may play a role in apparent spontaneous resolution of lifelong conditions having otherwise no prognosis of recovery.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;warrant investment in future research&#8221;…how? You&#8217;ve got one poorly understood, anecdotal observation, so how do you propose to do &#8220;research&#8221;? By gathering more anecdotal self-reports from believers in this phenomenon, and looking at more half-century old medical records? I&#8217;m also concerned that the authors now want to find people with &#8220;lifelong conditions having otherwise no prognosis of recovery&#8221; and tell them to pray for a cure. Most of those people will say they&#8217;ve already been praying for years, so…pray harder? Pray to the right god? Pray with the right magic words? It&#8217;s not as if they&#8217;ve identified a repeatable treatment or specific mechanism that they can test and refine.</p>
<p>I do note one admission that they authors make.</p>
<blockquote><p>Prayer is one of the most common complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a confession that most of CAM is useless.</p>

<p class="lead">West Virginia had a bill in the works to explicitly <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb619%20intr.htm&#038;yr=2023&#038;sesstype=RS&#038;i=619">allow the teaching of intelligent design creationism</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Teachers in public schools, including public charter schools, that include any one or more of grades kindergarten through 12, may teach intelligent design as a theory of how the universe and/or humanity came to exist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never fear, <a href="https://www.au.org/the-latest/press/defeat-west-virginia-intelligent-design-bill/#">Americans United is on the case</a>. It didn&#8217;t pass, not yet at least.</p>
<blockquote><p>Americans United for Separation of Church and State President and CEO Rachel Laser issued the following statement in response to the West Virginia Legislature adjourning without passing Senate Bill 619, a bill that would have authorized public school teachers to teach intelligent design creationism:</p>
<p>“We at Americans United are thankful that West Virginia public school students won’t be forced to sit through lessons on intelligent design creationism – an inherently religious doctrine that has no place in public schools. Public schools are not Sunday schools; their purpose is to teach students sound science, not preach religious beliefs.</p>
<p>“While the intelligent design bill failed this session, it’s alarming that the bill got as much traction as it did. The bill’s supporters blatantly ignored the Constitution’s promise to separate church and state – the protector of religious freedom – and would have flouted decades of court precedent that bars the teaching of religious doctrine in public schools, including an Americans United case that successfully proved intelligent design was simply creationism rebranded.</p>
<p>“If legislators insist on resurrecting this bill, Americans United is ready to defend the Constitution and protect public education and the religious freedom of West Virginia families. Using our public schools to impose religious doctrines like intelligent design on a captive audience of schoolchildren is part of the Christian Nationalist agenda to force all of us to live by their narrow beliefs. We need a national recommitment to the separation of church and state. Our public schools and our democracy depend on it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The creationists are persistent little buggers, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a box full of crap you can get <em>for free</em> from <a href="https://livingwaters.com/london/">LivingWaters/london</a>. Just fill out the form at that link, giving Ray Comfort your address, and he will ship up to <em>ten boxes of his book and Bible tracts about the coronation.</em></p>

<p>You could have a thousand copies of Ray&#8217;s book and six thousand cheesy tracts delivered to your doorstep, totally free. Unless you&#8217;re in the UK, EU, Australia, or New Zealand, in which case you don&#8217;t get the books, just 10,000 cheesy tracts. Or if you&#8217;re outside those countries, you get nothing, and will have to pick up your free tracts in person in London.</p>
<p>From this I have determined that Canada is truly blessed.</p>
<p>I thought about ordering a box, just to bleed a few drops from the bloated vampiric corpse of Ray Comfort&#8217;s unaccountably rich organization, but decided not to. My reasons: a) it&#8217;s not enough to exsanguinate the parasite, b) it would just encourage him, c) it&#8217;s incredibly wasteful and would just have to be recycled, and d) I don&#8217;t want to read his stupid book (I&#8217;ve read enough Comfort to know it will be awful), I don&#8217;t want his tracts, and I don&#8217;t need a box of waste paper in my house. The man is giving away free garbage, and that does not appeal.</p>
<p>I still have to wonder, though: does ol&#8217; Ray have some multi-millionaire sugar daddy? Or does he get so much in donations from a horde of deluded Christians that he can afford these ridiculous give-aways? Does he pay taxes on all of his revenues that he then spends on evangelical nonsense?</p>
<p>By the way, Ray Comfort is very, very excited about the coronation…but he&#8217;s not going to bother to go himself. He wants his minions to do the humiliating work of distributing his crap to all the people who don&#8217;t want it in London.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Capture.jpg" height="531" alt="The cover of Cocoon" width="343"></strong></p> <p><strong>Cocoon</strong> (World Editions) by Zhang Yueran, translated by Jeremy Tiang</p> <p>Zhang Yueran is one of China&rsquo;s &ldquo;post-80s&rdquo; writers, also known as the Y generation. Born in 1982 in Jinan, Shandong, in the wake of the Cultural Revolution and the one-child policy, she grew up in the Reform era. This epic novel (which took Zhang seven years to complete) is a stunning evocation of China&rsquo;s recent past and a poignant examination of how events reverberate through the decades.</p> <p>Former friends Li Jiaqi and Cheng Gong meet in their childhood home on the campus of Jinan&rsquo;s medical university. Jiaqi&rsquo;s grandfather, &ldquo;the most famous heart surgeon in China&rdquo;, is dying of lung cancer and she has returned to care for him in his final days. Zhang uses startling imagery in her opening pages to illustrate her protagonist&rsquo;s alienation: &ldquo;I stood by his bed, feeling death hover like a flock of bats.&rdquo;</p> <p>The pair have not met for 18 years and attempt to lay to rest the ghosts that still haunt them. In the course of their conversation, they revisit the family secrets that helped destroy their own hopes and dreams. Their narratives are given equal weight in separate chapters, although Jiaqi&rsquo;s is the more memorable. As they drink through the night and share their stories, old wounds are reopened and emotional scars retraced.</p> <p>Zhang is interested in the psychological fallout of China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution on her generation. Both her characters are neglected by their fathers, who, Zhang suggests, are victims of the harsh times in which they grew up. Their parents&rsquo; disillusionment initially unites the friends but, later, it rips them apart. Zhang writes perceptively about Jiaqi&rsquo;s relationship with her father: her desire to be loved by him; his coldness towards her; her subsequent inability to form lasting attachments. The passages describing his indifference towards his young daughter are heartbreaking.</p> <p>Jiaqi and Gong are surrounded by the vestiges of state oppression, vividly conveyed by their childhood playground &ndash; Dead Man&rsquo;s Tower. Originally constructed as a water tower when the Germans inhabited Jinan, it became the gruesome home for the cadavers and spare organs used in the university&rsquo;s dissection classes and experiments. It&rsquo;s a sinister wasteland, the soil permeated with formaldehyde. Jiaqi swiftly recognises its importance: that &ldquo;anyone who came here would be afraid to commit any crimes, especially capital ones... it wasn&rsquo;t easy to squander your life and not leave behind anything of value&mdash;they could always come and gouge it out of your remains.&rdquo;</p> <p>The central act of violence that drives the narrative takes place in 1967. As hospital manager, Gong&rsquo;s grandfather is denounced by rebels in a &ldquo;struggle session&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s beaten up and left unconscious in the Dead Man&rsquo;s Tower, a brutal attack from which he never fully recovers. Later, the family discover that someone had inserted &ldquo;a two-inch iron nail in his cranial cavity that must have entered through his temple, leaving a scar so small no one had paid it any attention&rdquo;. The nail had rusted, spreading infection through his brain tissue and leaving him in a vegetative state.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s the children&rsquo;s desire to know who committed the crime that leads to their own fracture. As Jiaqi observes: &ldquo;Secrets become secrets and get hidden away because they have the capacity for destruction... It&rsquo;s hard to say what it was that suppressed our childhood creativity, but we couldn&rsquo;t create, only destroy. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because in this country, destruction is always seen as the highest form of creation.&rdquo;</p> <p>Zhang believes &ldquo;the point of literature is to bring us to a deeper level of existence, so we can experience something we never have before.&rdquo; She manages to do just that in this remarkably astute novel, superbly translated by Jeremy Tiang. Her compelling narrative never lets up as she weaves together threads of memory which the reader has to unpick to reveal the truth. Cocoon is a powerful and stark account of intergenerational trauma.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Netradipa Patil has helped create a network of women who are fighting back against widowhood traditions" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/IMG_5358.jpg" height="1447" alt="Netradipa Patil smiles and looks into the camera, her arms folded, wearing a pink and gold sari" width="1448"></p> <p>For years, community healthcare worker Netradipa Patil had been making her rounds in rural Shirol, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. She enquired into people&rsquo;s health and asked how she could be of assistance. One day, she decided to ask an extra question: &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; She noticed that several women didn&rsquo;t even reply. Patil was haunted by their blank stares and silence. What made them feel so low? When she returned soon after, she encouraged these women to speak and spent hours listening to their stories. She discovered they were widows who had been harshly ostracised by their communities.</p> <p>There are more than 55 million widows living in India today. While dealing with the grief and financial loss often caused by losing their husbands, many of these women are pressured into conforming to traditions that have been described as &ldquo;social death&rdquo;. Excluded from festivals and celebrations, many are expected to stay in their homes for a year or longer after the death. These restrictions are accompanied by stigma. In some remote villages, widows are expelled from the community and sent to shelter homes.</p> <p>&ldquo;None of these rituals make any sense,&rdquo; says Patil. But in several parts of India, a woman&rsquo;s identity is still tied to that of her husband. &ldquo;This tradition goes back several centuries and the reason it&rsquo;s followed even today is to curb women&rsquo;s freedom and put restrictions on them.&rdquo; If a widow fails to follow these rituals, she is shamed. People may even accuse her of never having loved her husband.</p> <p>Patil was familiar with these customs, but still she was shocked by the women&rsquo;s stories. &ldquo;It left me numb,&rdquo; she says. One woman was a fellow healthcare worker, Lalita Mudshinge. She was in her early 30s when her husband, a tractor driver, died of a heart attack in 2017. Immediately, she was asked to break her bangles, remove the necklace and vermillion mark associated with married women, and refrain from wearing colourful clothes. Furthermore, she was forbidden from participating in weddings, child naming ceremonies and other celebrations.</p> <p>Mudshinge was prepared for this ostracisation. She also anticipated being blamed for her husband&rsquo;s death, as many widows are. &ldquo;I kept all the medical records safely and even the autopsy report,&rdquo; she says. But despite the evidence that he had died of cardiac arrest, she was still accused by her in-laws and members of the community of playing a part. They also wanted to force her to stay in the house for a year. This was not possible, as Mudshinge, like Patil, worked as a community healthcare worker, which meant regular trips into the centre of the village.</p> <p>&ldquo;The men from the village would stalk me in the streets and make bad comments,&rdquo; she said. The abuse reached a stage where even stepping out of her front door began to feel dangerous. &ldquo;I was so stressed and scared that I often fell ill,&rdquo; she says. The social stigma directly impacted her work, with senior staff yelling at her constantly. &ldquo;Mudshinge was suicidal, depressed, and on the verge of leaving her job,&rdquo; Patil says. However, within a few years, she was helping her fellow widows and battling patriarchal attitudes in her country. How did it happen?</p> <h2>The fight back begins</h2> <p>It all started with that extra question, &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; This simple invitation to speak progressed into hours of conversation, as Mudshinge was finally able to explain her plight. Patil gave Mudshinge her contact details and said to reach out at any time. She also started visiting the woman&rsquo;s home and tried to persuade her in-laws to stop practising the widowhood rituals.</p> <p>Initially, they were not convinced. So, Patil increased the visits. After a few months, Mudshinge began noticing a change. Her in-laws were more accepting of her leaving the house, and even allowed her to wear jewellery and colourful clothes. Men from the community continued to harass her when she did her rounds as a healthcare worker, but after Patil began accompanying her, she found she was more able to face them down.</p> <p>Patil was helping five other widows at the time. They were all coping with challenges, and she felt they were not being adequately supported. So she reached out to a fellow healthcare worker in a nearby village. Together, they began to organise awareness sessions for widows.</p> <p>These healthcare workers understand the plight of widows because they are all women and come from rural communities themselves. They are Accredited Social Health Activists, or ASHA workers. There are over a million ASHAs in India: roughly one for every 1,000 people. They are all female and come from the communities they serve. They do everything from prenatal care to administering vaccines, providing medicines for common ailments and maintaining health records for every community member. <br>Patil started to team up with more ASHA workers, reasoning that widowhood was a serious public health matter and should be treated as such. At first, nobody came to the awareness sessions. They had to squeeze in talking to the widows during routine community visits. Finally, after around six months of this work, with remote counselling done by phone, a few women started showing up to the sessions. &ldquo;It was so powerful,&rdquo; Mudshinge says. &ldquo;It helped me muster the courage to face the stigma.&rdquo;</p> <p>There was still a long way to go, however, when it came to acceptance from the community. That&rsquo;s when Patil came up with a unique idea. She invited all the widows from the nearby villages and asked a local government official to join them for a special event. Patil asked the official to celebrate the widows for their heroism in battling the oppressive widowhood rituals. The official agreed. It was a bold move. News spread in the villages and beyond, and the event was covered by the regional media.</p> <p>Mudshinge printed the photos and kept them in her wallet. &ldquo;From then on, whenever someone abused me, I showed them these photos, and it helped me,&rdquo; she said. She would never have guessed that a photo could change her life. The event expanded into a series, hosted by several villages in Maharashtra. At each event, widows were celebrated and encouraged to break with the rituals and practices that had brought so much suffering into their lives.</p> <p>Around the same time, social activist Pramod Zinjade started a movement asking village heads in Maharashtra to pass a resolution to ban the widowhood rituals outright. In May last year, Herwad became the first village to do so. The state government asked all villages to follow suit, and reportedly 7,500 villages have passed resolutions seeking to curb the practices. However, there are no legal ramifications if these resolutions are not followed through, so it&rsquo;s difficult to say how effective they will be.</p> <h2>Just the beginning</h2> <p>Changing local and state policy is important. But the work doesn&rsquo;t end there. As lawyer and activist Amol Naik says, &ldquo;Implementation is the key.&rdquo; Naik has spent over a decade fighting to protect and uphold the rights of women farmers and agricultural labourers, many of whom suffer greatly if they are faced with widowhood. He points out that widows do have legal rights under Indian law &ndash; such as the right to inherit their husband&rsquo;s property &ndash; but often feel unable to assert these rights. &ldquo;Younger widows are ostracised and made to feel that their relatives are doing them a favour by letting them stay [in their own homes]. Eventually, they stop asking.&rdquo;</p> <p>Akkatai Teli is an activist who has spent four decades working with widows and bringing the perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence to justice. She says that many widows aren&rsquo;t aware of their legal rights and there can often be a vested interest in not telling them. &ldquo;Most of them are denied a share in the property and kicked out of the house because the in-laws fear they will ascertain their rights,&rdquo; she says. Many of these women end up in shelter homes. The problem is so severe that in 2018, the government built a shelter home in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, that can accommodate 1,000 widows.</p> <p>Patil, meanwhile, has continued to work on the root cause of widows&rsquo; problems. Between 2017 and 2022 she trained a team of 20 women, most of whom are widows themselves, to help combat regressive customs. So far, the network has helped hundreds of widows from over 20 villages in Maharashtra. Her attempts are now being formalised into a full-time support system at the village, district and state levels.</p> <p>Patil&rsquo;s goal is not just to help these women heal, but to ensure they can live a life of dignity. This involves practical support; ensuring the widows have the correct paperwork to access government welfare, training them to become self-reliant and helping them start their own businesses. She also helps them access mental health treatment. &ldquo;Telling their stories can be triggering for the women,&rdquo; she says, so they have learned to be careful in their work.</p> <p>But there is another challenge. As an ASHA, Patil isn&rsquo;t paid for her work with the widows, nor is she trained to provide counselling. &ldquo;The health department doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge our work,&rdquo; she says. The work with widows is classed as voluntary. She says that ASHAs aren&rsquo;t paid enough in any case, and could achieve much more with adequate compensation.</p> <p>While the exact figures vary across states, they are uniformly low. In Maharashtra, ASHAs earn an average of 3,500-5,000 Indian Rupees (&pound;34-50) per month. They are paid per task &ndash; for example, for providing antenatal or postnatal care and overseeing a pregnancy in a public hospital, they earn &pound;4.90. &ldquo;ASHAs are a support system for millions of people,&rdquo; Patil points out. &ldquo;If the government starts paying us adequately and on time, many [more] ASHAs can help women recover from their trauma.&rdquo;</p> <h2>A turning point</h2> <p>Ongoing support is important, as even if the lives of widows improve, they still have to recover from the abuse and ostracisation. When Anjali Pehelwan, 39, lost her husband to Covid, her relatives weren&rsquo;t concerned about her grief. &ldquo;All they wanted was to forcefully take away my jewellery and toe rings,&rdquo; she remembers. Although Pehelwan resisted, a few women pulled off her jewellery, bruising and cutting her. The cuts healed in a week, she says, but it took a year before she recovered from the mental trauma.</p> <p>Luckily, Pehelwan was able to access support. She was put in touch with Maya Patil, the ASHA worker who had helped Netradipa organise the very first awareness sessions for widows. (Netradipa and Maya share a last name but are not related.) Maya Patil started counselling Pehelwan on the phone and in person. Gradually, Pehelwan started wearing her jewellery again, began to leave the house, and started asking people to treat her as an equal to other women. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. &ldquo;The community members were so aghast that they started calling me ill-omened and a witch,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>Then, in April 2022, Maya Patil came up with the idea of celebrating Gudi Padwa (Maharashtra&rsquo;s new year), considered to be the most auspicious occasion in the Hindu calendar. &ldquo;Traditionally, while a widow is allowed to celebrate this occasion, they are barred from performing any rituals,&rdquo; Pehelwan explains. Maya Patil was determined to change this. She called a group of 20 women together, including Pehelwan and another widow. &ldquo;I started talking about the discriminatory practices and why we should raise our voice,&rdquo; she says. At first, the other women stepped away from the widows, but Patil wouldn&rsquo;t give up. She convinced them to celebrate the new year festival together, with Pehelwan taking the lead.</p> <p>There was a backlash from certain members of the community. People spread a rumour that Pehelwan was celebrating the festival because she had remarried. (Widows in India are allowed to remarry, but in reality they are often ostracised if they do.) A scandal was brewing, but fortunately the local journalists reported the event accurately, confirming that Pehelwan was still single. &ldquo;That was the best time to shut down all such conspiracy theories,&rdquo; she recalls, laughing at the memory.</p> <p>Later, Pehelwan discovered that there were 450 widows and separated women in her village of Arjunwad alone. &ldquo;We need to stop using the word &lsquo;widow&rsquo; and come up with better words,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;&lsquo;Widow&rsquo; is never a woman&rsquo;s identity. It&rsquo;s no fault of hers that her husband has died.&rdquo; She found that many women wanted to oppose the rituals, but didn&rsquo;t speak up because of the patriarchal system. &ldquo;My goal is to help them voice their concerns.&rdquo;</p> <p>Pehelwan works long hours as a data entry operator. But although her work is tiring, she spends her evenings taking phone calls from other widows, encouraging them to leave the house and assert their rights. &ldquo;People think it&rsquo;s a burden, but it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Whenever I see a woman healing, I feel I have given someone a new life. While this can never make up for my loss, I am proud to help bring an end to the trauma of other women.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Robert Pirsig's 1974 bestseller continues to serve as a gospel for long-distance bikers" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/iswanto-arif-m1nHYuMvBAI-unsplash-small.jpg" height="1448" alt="A man on a motorbike in the mountains" width="1448"></p> <p>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, published in 1974, was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon. A work of fictionalised autobiography, the book follows its author Robert Pirsig on a long motorcycle ride through the US, from Minnesota across the prairie to Oregon, then down to southern California. The muscles of that skeletal journey are Pirsig&rsquo;s philosophical musings on the notion of Quality. Pirsig created the concept in order explain the relationship between human values and societal values.</p> <p>At once both obvious and ephemeral, Quality escapes easy definition. (And brings to mind American supreme court justice Potter Stewart&rsquo;s comments about pornography: &ldquo;I know it when I see it.&rdquo;) In his original formulation, Pirsig describes it, not a little paradoxically, as &ldquo;a characteristic of thought and statement that is recognised by a non-thinking or intuitive process.&rdquo; At another juncture, Quality is defined as the event which occurs between the observer and the observed. Pirsig&rsquo;s search for clarity stretched his mind to the breaking point, ultimately landing him in a psychiatric facility where he was subjected to electroshock therapy.</p> <p>And yet, the concept has been influential. The book, a bestseller, continues to be read by motorcyclists, philosophers and everyone in between. This year, a long-awaited collection of writings has been published for the first time, giving us a deeper look at how Pirsig shaped his concept. Edited by Pirsig&rsquo;s widow Wendy, an archivist and Pirsig&rsquo;s frequent collaborator, On Quality uses outtakes from unpublished letters and lectures, and from Pirsig&rsquo;s two books (Zen and 1991&rsquo;s Lila). It is an intimate and highly selective look at his journey through the work of the early Greek philosophers, Asiatic mysticism and beyond.</p> <p>Again and again, he approaches the concept from different angles, employing simile, analogy and deductive reasoning. Often, he only tightens the knot he has created. But there are moments of brilliance. In a letter written in 1995, Pirsig outlined where he saw Quality fitting among the pantheon of religious philosophy, placing it beside Hinduism&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oneness&rdquo; Buddhism&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nothingness&rdquo; and the monotheist&rsquo;s &ldquo;God&rdquo; as a fourth path leading up &ldquo;the mountain of understanding&rdquo;. Optimistically, he singles out Quality as the one that cannot be dismissed by the &ldquo;scientifically minded&rdquo; as &ldquo;meaningless, metaphysical claptrap&rdquo;.</p> <p>Quality then, is a kind of religion, though one preaching improvement for its own sake, rather than in the service of some deity. It is less concerned with eternal life than with the pursuit of truth and beauty. Much of its appeal lies in Pirsig&rsquo;s prose, which combines his repetitive, mantra-like style with a pragmatic, matter-of-fact charm. The book is illustrated with photos of his collection of tools &ndash; spanners, drills, pliers and the like &ndash; a reminder that this was a philosopher with dirt under his fingernails.</p> <h2>The goal of truth</h2> <p>I first read Pirsig in 2012, while preparing for my own long motorcycle journey, from the Canadian prairie to the Argentinian Pampa. It strikes me now as a voyage from one cattle country to another, though at that time it was too sinuous and ill-planned to be so clearly defined. I had none of Pirsig&rsquo;s discipline, but like him, I struggled to find meaning in what I was pursuing. Was I travelling as catharsis? For freedom? For evasion? Adventure seemed the most likely reason, but I was too often alone and inconsolable to convince myself of that pursuit.</p> <p>If Quality is the quasi-religion of what Pirsig called the &ldquo;Church of Reason&rdquo;, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is its holy book. I wasn&rsquo;t the only one to treat it as such. Motorcyclists I met on that trip, and have met since, talk about Zen as a kind of compendium for life. Like most adherents, there was among them more enthusiasm (which means, as Pirsig points out, &ldquo;filled with theos&rdquo;, or God) for Pirsig than drive for understanding.</p> <p>When Zen was first published, motorcycle travel literature was not yet the identifiable genre it is today. That variety of travelogue began in earnest in 1979 with the appearance of Ted Simon&rsquo;s Jupiter&rsquo;s Travels, the story of a five-year round-the-world odyssey between 1973 and 1977. If Pirsig was a kind of modern Homer, Simon was like Virgil: pagan and worldly, inured in scholarship of prose, yet beset with laurels of deism. &ldquo;Of all the gods in the pantheon,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;Jupiter is the one I fancy most. A lovely name, Jupiter, like cream and honey in the mouth. And a sense of great distance and closeness at the same time.&rdquo;</p> <p>Compare that to Pirsig, who wrote in Zen that &ldquo;The primary goal of the Church of Reason... is always Socrates&rsquo; old goal of truth, in its ever-changing forms, as it&rsquo;s revealed by the process of rationality.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s easy to see why motorcyclists might choose the path of Simon&rsquo;s self-aggrandisement over Pirsig&rsquo;s &ldquo;goal of truth&rdquo;. There was always the temptation to play at being god. While my own pan-American odyssey was underway, I came to recognise a particular mindset in fellow riders: an air of being separate in space and time, of being out of reality and untouchable. There were plenty of vengeful Odins and chaotic brothers of Mars riding into town with conquering on their minds. My own choice of god at the time was the callous and boozy Dionysus.</p> <p>Unambiguously foreign, strangely dressed, noisy, incorrigible, we rode our machines across the world as though it were the plains of Troy. We were given beds, food and love &ndash; offerings we accepted as tributes for our appearance on the battlefield. When we left, it was not uncommon for crowds of people to appear to see us off. The effect was inebriating, nectar for the ego. Today, those events put me in mind of Patrick Kavanagh&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Epic&rdquo;, which ends with the lines: &ldquo;Till Homer&rsquo;s ghost came whispering to my mind. / He said: I made the Iliad from such / A local row. Gods make their own importance.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Wreaking havoc</h2> <p>But therein lies the trouble with gods &ndash; they do not go out into the world to learn, but to teach, to wreak havoc, have their way with mortals; they live in the world as they want it, rather than as it is. Passing through one country after another, often without our &ldquo;required&rdquo; documents, and with the freedom of our vehicles, we felt that we had passed beyond the rules of society. I rode all over the Americas illegally, my expired paperwork needing only a few flicks of my pen to change the date.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand why travelers feel out of step with the world around them. Society is largely based on repetition and reliability, neither of which travel provides. But enough time ignoring the rules and a detached superiority begins to settle in. And then, the worst: bored with the thrills offered by the natural world, by spontaneity, by socialising, such riders turn from life to arithmetic: tallying up miles ridden, countries entered, tyres blown, meals eaten. Quantity becomes synonymous with merit, and the most venerable are those who have &ldquo;done more&rdquo;. As the urge to quantify rises, Quality suffers.</p> <p>Simon ends Jupiter&rsquo;s Travels with this reflection: &ldquo;Often I dream of riding over the hard red floor of a great forest, beneath a high canopy of translucent green, spreading on and on. An enchanted forest, perhaps, where men may still sometimes play at being gods.&rdquo; Pirsig ends Zen in a very different manner, by saying that &ldquo;to understand Quality, he would have to leave the mythos.&rdquo; It continues: &ldquo;[he] emerges as if from a dream, seeing that his whole consciousness, the mythos, has been a dream and no one&rsquo;s dream but his own, a dream he must now sustain of his own efforts.&rdquo;</p> <p>There is much to admire in motorcycle writing, but too much of it today is a poor imitation of the genre&rsquo;s forefathers. We will not produce another writer like Robert Pirsig until we can differentiate quantity from Quality. And we have to stop playing at being gods.</p> <p><em><span class="Apple-converted-space">This article is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here.</a></span></em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ageofstrongman.jpg" height="697" alt="The Age of the Strongman by Gideon Rachman" width="462"></em></p> <p><strong><br>The Age of the Strongman</strong> (Bodley Head) by Gideon Rachman</p> <p>The rivalry between democracy and autocracy promises to define much of this century. The Age of the Strongman by the Financial Times&rsquo; chief foreign affairs commentator Gideon Rachman attempts to explain how we got here. The central thrust is that, since the 1990s, the rise of a certain type of leader has become the key feature of &ldquo;the most sustained global assault on liberal democracy since the 1930s&rdquo;. By profiling 14 current-day leaders with authoritarian tendencies &ndash; from central Europe to South America to the Philippines &ndash; Rachman hopes to provide &ldquo;political liberals&rdquo; with an &ldquo;understanding of what they are dealing with&rdquo;.<br><br>Rachman begins with an outline of the &ldquo;playbook&rdquo; that has propelled strongmen into power. A common tactic is populist nationalism, which paints the strongman as a national saviour, pitting an ethnically and/or religiously defined nation against outside threats such as minority groups, migrants or a shadowy elite. In power, the erosion of civil liberties is a natural consequence. Rachman reminds us how strongmen have subjugated ethnic and religious communities in their countries. Whilst China&rsquo;s Xi detains Uyghurs in &ldquo;re-education&rdquo; camps, Narendra Modi has effectively stripped millions of Muslims of their Indian citizenship. Independent institutions and organisations are neutered. While some strongmen, like Viktor Orb&aacute;n, are known for hollowing out their country&rsquo;s independent media, others, like Vladimir Putin, preside over countries where journalists regularly turn up dead.<br><br>Rachman refuses to explain the rise of this authoritarianism through the talents of strongmen alone, nor does he assert that certain countries are predisposed to this rule. Chapters on Boris Johnson and Donald Trump dispel the myth that the west is impervious to democratic decline. Instead, Rachman argues that the success of strongmen is a &ldquo;symptom of the crisis of liberalism&rdquo;, which has economic, political and diplomatic dimensions.<br><br>Driving this crisis, according to Rachman, is an &ldquo;overconfidence in the power of liberal ideas born from &lsquo;victory&rsquo; in the Cold War&rdquo;. This prevented politicians and commentators from judging the true character of strongmen early in their careers. Rachman includes himself in this, going so far as to quote from one of his past articles that celebrated Modi&rsquo;s &ldquo;thrilling&rdquo; rise. The free market&rsquo;s most ardent defenders have since had to reckon with the compatibility of the system with authoritarianism.<br><br>But despite beginning what promises to be a meaningful critique of the liberal world order, Rachman never quite gets down to it. Instead, he regresses into clich&eacute;. His acknowledgement of the ills of globalisation is descriptive at best. The term &ldquo;neoliberalism&rdquo; is dismissed as an invention of the populist left, as if it wasn&rsquo;t the object of serious academic enquiry. Meanwhile, strongman critiques of the liberal world order go unexplored. Grievances against US foreign policy, Nato and the EU &ndash; some of which may be justified &ndash; are dismissed. It is unclear what Rachman has learnt from reckoning with post-Cold War politics.<br><br>This reversion to type is finalised in the book&rsquo;s conclusion, where the strongman is dismissed as a short-lived fad, and we are told to trust the US to lead a new &ldquo;human-rights based world order&rdquo;. Rachman fails to take seriously the US&rsquo; vulnerability to a Trump-like resurgence, or the grisly legacy of its foreign intervention since the Second World War. In the end, his pages are haunted by the same liberal overconfidence he finds complicit in the rise of the strongman. To strengthen liberalism against rising authoritarianism requires tougher questions of its historical record; perhaps even a consideration about the case for reinvention, something Rachman firmly rules out.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Peter Salmon asks, how did we get here?</p> <blockquote> <p class="p1">In Christianity we are born with sin and spend our lives trying to repay that debt. In capitalism we must keep earning to stop our financial debt growing. This moral imperative is analogous with the prevalent framing of fitness today as an endless and unresolvable quest: one can always be fitter, and not pursuing this goal is a failing to oneself and to society.</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1"><strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">Q&amp;A: Anna Lembke</span></strong></p> <p class="p1">The program director of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Fellowship talks to <strong>J.P. O'Malley</strong> about how to create a healthy pleasure-pain balance.</p> <blockquote> <p class="p1">What I have seen over two decades of clinical work is parents who have assiduously insulated their children not just from painful experiences, but really any kind of challenging experiences.

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>
