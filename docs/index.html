            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Can&#8217;t think. Can&#8217;t read. Can&#8217;t write. My brain is focused entirely on not moving my leg, or sometimes on moving it to a more comfortable position &#8212; which <em>doesn&#8217;t exist</em>. My right ankle continues to swell, and my whole foot is turning pink, so everything is getting worse.</p>
<p>After praising the alacrity of my treatment yesterday, though, we have hit a snag. Everything has been held up because…further work has to be approved by the <em>insurance company</em>. I guess they have a lot of highly qualified orthopedic surgeons examining my case and going &#8220;hmmm&#8221;, and wondering whether I can handle more chronic pain before they approve treatment.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/demonsign.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/demonsign-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-70864" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/demonsign-300x300.png 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/demonsign-150x150.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/demonsign-768x768.png 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/demonsign-500x500.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/08/demonsign.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>So I get to suffer for a few more days before we can take the next step.</p>
<p>I am not asking for sympathy, though. Don&#8217;t feel sorry for me! The health insurance demons have found me wanting and think I deserve a few more pokes from the pitchfork. Instead, I would appreciate your curses and imprecatory prayers directed at the health insurance industry and the whole damn American health care system. My situation is relatively minor compared to what others must suffer.</p>

<p class="lead">That&#8217;s doctorese for &#8220;your bone spurs are shredding your Achilles tendon, bro!&#8221; It&#8217;s exactly what I expected, but I also got a bunch of tests to rule out blood clots and gout. Now I&#8217;m scheduled for an MRI this afternoon to get the fine details, and once we work that out, next step is probably surgery. Yay.</p>
<p>One nice thing about living in a small town is that I called the clinic, they got me into an appointment this morning, I gave up a quart of blood for tests, got an X-ray, and got the conclusions within an hour. There&#8217;s a bit of a wait for the MRI, but it&#8217;s still same day service.</p>
<p>I recall taking my son into a clinic for a clearly broken arm in Philadelphia, and sitting there for almost 6 hours before he was treated. I show up here with a complaint that I&#8217;ve got an ouchie on my ankle and they whip me through like lightning. Maybe I&#8217;m just better at whining and complaining?</p>

<p class="lead">I really overdid it yesterday &#8212; I took a powerful dose of ibuprofen so I could walk around in the wilderness, and it worked. I was walking around in rough terrain, rather gingerly I&#8217;ll admit, and then I got home and a little later the drugs wore off and now…holy crap, I was so stupid. I&#8217;ve spent the day doing nothing but lying back and moaning.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a day of drugs and ice. I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll be able to go in to work tomorrow, but the rational side of my brain is telling me not to be stupid again, to call the doctor in the morning, and stay off my damned pathetic ankle.</p>
<p>This is not good, since I&#8217;m flying off to visit the family in the Pacific Northwest on Friday, and at this rate I&#8217;ll be doing it from a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Did I mention I was an idiot?</p>

With the help of my Filofax I can usually manage to honour the bulk of my friends&rsquo; birthdays &ndash; &ldquo;Hi Charlotte. Best wishes for your very special day. Gosh doesn&rsquo;t time fly. Do give me a ring next time you&rsquo;re down south&rdquo; &ndash; but I am frankly unable to pronounce with any degree of certainty upon the length of my present marriage, the exact number of years since my pacemaker was fitted or the precise date when my beloved Liverpool were last declared champions of Europe.</p> <p>However, the week before last, when I trooped into Broadcasting House to make another edition of my BBC Radio 4 programme Thinking Allowed, I was energetically confronted by my normally cool producer. Did I know the significance of the episode we were about to make? Not really. Did the year 1998 mean anything to me? Not really. Sorry. Sorry.</p> <p>My producer gave me a slightly sorrowful smile. &ldquo;Laurie, this is our anniversary. Our programme has now been broadcast on Radio 4 for exactly 25 years. So many great memories! Remember the social mobility programme?&rdquo;</p> <p>How could I forget? I knew immediately she was talking about the day, 20 years ago, when I was interviewing an expert on social mobility and noticed with alarm that he was sliding from his studio chair. In the hope that he might quickly right himself, I pursued my questioning. &ldquo;Your research indicates an overall decline in social mobility&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;How might you account for that?&rdquo;</p> <p>I never got my answer because, with a little whimper, my guest slipped further sideways and then, with a little jerk, fell to the studio floor where he lay motionless amid a tangled mass of studio cables. A frantic producer hissed into my earphones. &ldquo;Laurie. Laurie. Go to your emails.&rdquo; Thankfully the guest was fine and in the pub afterwards we laughed ourselves silly over the incident.</p> <p>But that happy memory epitomises my problem with all such anniversaries: they rarely have a singular dimension. So while it was certainly great fun to remember the day of the disappearing studio guest, I couldn&rsquo;t relish the incident without also remembering that it occurred at the very time that I was desperately trying to end my unhappy relationship with Sandra, suffering from a rather nasty pubic rash, and had just been told by my dentist that the inside of my mouth resembled a blitzed housing estate.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s a paradox perfectly captured by Philip Larkin in his poem &ldquo;Reference Back&rdquo;:</p> <p>&ldquo;Truly, though our element is time,<br>We&rsquo;re not suited to the long perspectives<br>Open at each instant of our lives.<br>They link us to our losses...&rdquo;</p> <p>There is perhaps one surprising and positive aspect to anniversaries. They can remind us of the road not taken. Nobody captured that benefit with more fervour than my old friend Angela, who, in a tipsy conversation during her 38th wedding anniversary party, confided this insight.</p> <p>&ldquo;Laurie&rdquo;, she said, glancing across the room to her husband. &ldquo;You know what this anniversary has made me realise? If I had killed Maurice the first time I thought about it, I&rsquo;d have been out of jail by now.&rdquo;</p> <p>No such muddled memories ever interfered with my mother&rsquo;s wholesale embrace of anniversaries. During my childhood, I was frequently reminded that I had been named due to the proximity of my birthday to the date of the martyrdom of Saint Laurence.</p> <p>In one respect, Saint Laurence deserved to be honoured. He famously gave all his money away to charity. However, as I later learned, in honouring his anniversary I would also be honouring the date in AD 258 when he was martyred on a red-hot gridiron. As the coals burned into his skin, he had the temerity to give a word of advice to his torturers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m well done on this side. Turn me over&rdquo;.</p> <p>For all my horror of anniversaries, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking that this ancient utterance by my namesake might make a rather fine last set of words &ndash; for myself.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Dolls from Barbie's 'Inspiring Women' range. Credit: Mattel" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/barbie-cropped.jpg" height="479" alt="Rosa Parks, Frida Kahlo and Sally Ride in Barbie form, from Mattel's 'Inspiring Women Series'" width="747"></p> <p>You never really notice how many Japanese tourists there are in central London, do you? They aren&rsquo;t brutish like the Americans, and rarely go around complaining about everything like the French. They just blend into the background, quietly taking photos. But walking from Westminster to Soho in mid-July, on my way to a screening of Greta Gerwig&rsquo;s <em>Barbie</em>, they were suddenly unavoidable. The problem was that I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about the letters splashed across my chest, written in bright pink, swirly script. &ldquo;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds&rdquo;, the T-shirt screamed.</p> <p>Like a dress that is too tight or heels too high, the shirt seemed like a good idea until I left the house. It was, you see, a &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo; shirt, made to celebrate the fact that <em>Barbie</em> was coming out on the same day as Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s <em>Oppenheimer</em>, a thriller about the man who led the development of the atomic bomb. The clash of the two movies, with their incongruous combination of themes, was always bound to become a meme. Plans were hatched around the world to go see them one after the other and debates were had on which to see first &ndash; including what anyone could possibly wear to fit with both themes.</p> <p>All this made me laugh a lot, which is why I headed to the <em>Barbie</em> press screening wearing what I did. I thought Greta Gerwig would approve; before she became the pet director of a multinational toy company, she worked on a series of witty indie movies. Every bit of marketing behind <em>Barbie</em> made it seem like she was winking at us from behind a bubble gum curtain, hinting that she hadn&rsquo;t lost her edge. The whole thing would be odd and meta and knowingly farcical. Of course she&rsquo;d love &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo;. But walking to the cinema I suddenly became incredibly aware of the fact that I was wearing a T-shirt openly joking about the invention of a bomb that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians.</p> <p>Once in the Cineworld I experienced a different kind of unease. As journalists, we were told to sign an embargo and made to &ldquo;pinky promise&rdquo; not to leak anything by an upbeat woman holding her little finger in the air. Still, we were allowed &ndash; nay, encouraged! &ndash; to post any positive reactions we might have on social media. Large, pink bags of complimentary popcorn were sitting on our laps. What had we got ourselves into?</p> <p>The lights went out, two hours passed, and by the end I still wasn&rsquo;t sure. For the avoidance of doubt, <em>Barbie</em> is a fun movie. It is, at times, laugh-out-loud funny, Ryan Gosling&rsquo;s Ken is hysterically compelling, and the many cameos never fail to delight.</p> <p>The premise, if you must know, goes like this. Following a perfect day in Barbie Land, where Barbies are doctors and judges and journalists and Nobel Prize winners and presidents, and Kens are just Kens, one Barbie sinks into an existential funk. She sleeps poorly and cannot stop thinking about dying. The soles of her feet, once beautifully arched, are now stubbornly flat. There is cellulite on her thighs.</p> <p>Following a visit to Weird Barbie, a wise old doll who was played with so much that her hips cannot help but fall into the splits, it is concluded that a tear has opened up in the fabric of reality, caused by the connection between our Barbie and the girl playing with her being too strong. In order to stop both worlds coming to ruin, the doll must go to the real world and find out what is going on.</p> <p>What follows is&hellip;well, it&rsquo;s a lot. At first, Mattel executives appear to be the main antagonists, wishing to put the human-sized doll back in her box. You may be shocked to hear that this doesn&rsquo;t last &ndash; Mattel, after all, ordered and paid for the movie. Instead, the real twist comes when Ken, who followed Barbie on her jaunt, discovers the patriarchy.</p> <p>Men run things in the real world! They have cars and horses! It isn&rsquo;t like Barbie Land, where all they do is sit on the beach and yearn. He returns home before Barbie does and turns it into Kenland. By the time Protagonist Barbie comes back, all hell has got loose. What oh what can she and her human sidekicks do to restore the balance of the universe? You may be able to guess. It&rsquo;s feminism. What else could it possibly be?</p> <p>In fairness to Gerwig, she doesn&rsquo;t go for the lowest hanging fruit of female empowerment. Barbies aren&rsquo;t freed by being told that they can achieve anything a man can, if only they set their mind to it. Instead, their emancipation comes from a surprisingly irate speech from America Ferrera, playing the real-life mother of a teenage girl.</p> <p>It is impossible to be a woman, she says: the female experience in a patriarchal society is so full of contradictions that no woman can go through it without going mad. We must be assertive without being bossy; we must have money but never ask for it; we must look good but not so good that we draw too much attention to ourselves; we must run things without telling anyone what to do, and so on. In Kenland, as in any other society ruled by men, women can never win. Faced with this maddening realisation, the Barbies short-circuit and return to their old selves.</p> <p>Stripped of their power, the Kens begin lashing out then eventually demure. Running stuff is hard, it turns out! That&rsquo;s what Gosling&rsquo;s Ken tearfully tells Barbie. Because she is not in love with him, she tells him to find out who he is if he is not defined by his relationship with her. In the end, it feels worth noting that few people &ndash; or dolls &ndash; are truly happy, eschewing what would or should have been the conclusion of a more traditional storyline.</p> <p>In short: the <em>Barbie</em> movie really isn&rsquo;t as bad as it could have been, and I should know. I spent two hours chewing on my sweet, low-cal popcorn and scrutinising it. I took notes on the risqu&eacute; jokes and pondered its politics on my walk home.</p> <p>But then I caught myself wondering what wave of feminism <em>Barbie</em> felt closest to and it stopped me in my tracks. I&rsquo;d gone to see a movie about a plastic doll, made by the very people who manufacture that plastic doll. What on earth was I on about?</p> <p>I wondered if that is what the studio had wanted &ndash; if they&rsquo;d been trying to have their cake and eat it. The <em>Barbie</em> movie is pink and saccharine and, yes, enjoyable enough that anyone, teenage or not, can turn it into a fun day out. Its producer and occasional madcap promotional work were intriguing enough that pretentious essayists like me can try to tear it apart and see if there really is anything going on underneath.</p> <p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean we should, though. What if the <em>Barbie</em> movie was just that, a bit of harmless entertainment? Must everything have depth? Equally, must all mainstream pop culture be treated as deserving of pointed criticism?</p> <p>Mass internet culture has flattened everything and now all movies are treated the same &ndash; whether they are fantasy comedies, or heavyweights about the darkest parts of our history. I assumed I wanted to write an in-depth critique of <em>Barbie</em> because that is what people like me &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to do these days. I wore a T-shirt about a movie in which a man invents a bomb that can kill millions because I thought it was hilarious that it had become tied with a silly movie about girly girls. The meme had become so powerful that there was no meaning left.</p> <p>It isn&rsquo;t good for us, but it is good for business. People who probably do not care about military history got memed into going to watch a movie about it, and so did people who have no particular interest in children&rsquo;s toys. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it&rsquo;s mostly made me want to have an existential crisis, which is ironic because that is what makes Barbie leave Barbie Land and join the real world. Perhaps she was the lucky one. What do you do if nothing feels real in your world, but there is nowhere else you can escape to?</p> <p><em>This is a preview from the autumn 2023 issue of New Humanist. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe now</a> to get it delivered to your door in August.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Credit: Daniel J Schwarz/Unsplash" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/daniel-j-schwarz-eqzgl9kjvxi-unsplash-sq-small.jpg" height="1368" alt="Hikers on a mountainous path" width="1368"></p> <p>Imagine you&rsquo;re going for a hike with your friends. At a certain point on your walk, conditions turn for the worse and you realise you are lost. Whose intuition do you trust to get the group to safety? The experienced hiker or the beginner? Of course, you will turn to the former, even if they can&rsquo;t fully explain why they think a certain route is safer than another.</p> <p>Our intuitions guide us every day. It could be as simple as forming an opinion about a new acquaintance. You might have gotten a strange feeling from them, without any discernible cause. Most of us have a vast amount of experience in social contexts &ndash; and so, like the experienced hiker, we often feel justified in trusting our gut when it comes to other people.</p> <p>But what does it mean, to trust your gut? Historically, intuition has often been viewed as containing an individualised or collective truth, one that emerges from a spiritual or mystical place, disconnected from anything grounded in the material world. This could lead to &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; actions being seen as good and righteous, or even divinely warranted.</p> <p>Even today, people often view intuition as something mysterious. Like warm mud bubbling up from a geothermal pool, it emerges from a foreign world, and is therefore often cast as something outside the natural realm. It can be very appealing to view our intuitions in this way, especially when they guide our decisions in a manner that may be convenient to our own self-interest.</p> <p>But let&rsquo;s return to the group lost on the hike. There&rsquo;s a reason that we trust the experienced hiker. Under the hood they are likely making unconscious evaluations of different variables &ndash; slope, erosion, visibility &ndash; that together might make the difference between a terrible accident and a safe journey home. In a similar way, we are likely to arrive at split-second judgements about other people, through body language, facial expressions, vocal tone and eye contact, that we might not consciously perceive unless they become glaringly obvious.</p> <p>Less divine inspiration, then, and more a different <em>kind</em> of thinking.</p> <p>In modern psychology, intuitive and reflective thinking have been separated and categorised a number of times: implicit vs explicit, heuristic vs systematic, automatic vs controlled, and type 1 and type 2 thinking. Essentially, these types of thinking are contrasted by how much effort we put into making a decision. For intuitive, implicit, heuristic, automatic and type 1 thinking, decisions are made instinctively, where people rely on cues and rapid judgements. Whereas with reflective, explicit, systematic, controlled and type 2 thinking, decisions are made with more conscious effort, where we might weigh positives and negatives, or take the time to evaluate the different options we are choosing from.</p> <p>We now understand intuition as something that people develop over time, informed by unconscious learning and memory. As we move through the world, only a sliver of what our minds process moves through the medium of our conscious experiences. But our brains are constantly absorbing information, and generating models of the world. You could say that intuition is a way for the wisdom of our subconscious to &ldquo;knock on the door&rdquo; of our waking conscious experience &ndash; pointing us in the right direction, or, at least, in a direction that has served us well before.</p> <h2>When intuition meets science</h2> <p>If intuition were a sort of knowledge that becomes self-evident in the mind&rsquo;s eye, then we would expect little to no variation in the content of people&rsquo;s intuitive knowledge. But this, obviously, is not what we see. Some people might think the statement &ldquo;God exists&rdquo; is intuitively true, for example, while there is no shortage of people who would disagree. (It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that self-defined &ldquo;intuitive thinkers&rdquo; are more likely to believe in God.) What we find intuitive as individuals is deeply shaped by our own nuanced experiences, and the cultural and societal belief systems in which we are embedded.</p> <p>The phenomenology, or feeling, of intuition has been described by psychologists as involving a sense of coherence in the sensory signals that someone is receiving from the world, mandating a specific course of action when a reasoned path is either absent or impractical: a sense of knowing without knowing how one knows. No doubt, this strange phenomenology has pushed interpretations into spiritual waters, but this disregards the role of lived experiences and norms.</p> <p>Viewing intuition as a type of skill suggests it is something that can be pragmatically applied in contexts where we have cultivated it, as in the case of the experienced hiker. But one field where intuition might seem out of place is in the practice of science. Scientists are encouraged to remove their assumptions and biases from their theories, and to let the data do the talking. Theories are developed over time, with extensive thought being invested into their limitations and strengths. But can we really discount the role of intuition in science entirely?</p> <p>Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist working on a theory of quantum gravity, sees intuition as a necessary creative ingredient of the scientific process. With reason and rigour alone, nobody would ever have a good idea, but without them we would never recognise anything useful. In other words, science, for Rovelli, is &ldquo;the simultaneous triumph of intuition and the active limiting of intuition&rdquo;.</p> <p>Rovelli, who is the author of numerous popular science books like <em>The Order of Time</em> and <em>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</em>, also takes intuition seriously when it comes to teaching and communication. He tells me that he tries to cultivate the skill on a daily basis. &ldquo;Every morning I meet my student, we discuss &lsquo;new ideas&rsquo;, or &lsquo;new intuitions&rsquo;; that is, things we think we know but we don&rsquo;t know where the idea came from. But then science is about always remembering that there is nothing we know for sure.&rdquo;</p> <p>Sometimes we have to work from &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; or &ldquo;hints&rdquo;, he says, because they might give us an indication that we are headed in the right or wrong direction. &ldquo;This is how we think, this is how great scientists think,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Einstein thinks about riding a light ray, [Johannes] Kepler writes about flying through the Solar System. This is using intuition; connecting the dots courageously on the basis of analogies.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Filter, analyse, check</h2> <p>It may seem surprising that a scientist like Rovelli takes intuition so seriously. He is working in experimental quantum physics &ndash; a field beyond the parameters of our direct human experience, and on the cutting edge of our understanding. Particles at extremely small scales can act in ways that are alien to our everyday experiences of how objects move and interact with one another and the world. They can spontaneously disappear and reappear, some can share information across vast distances instantaneously, and some can move straight through anything without interacting at all.</p> <p>In the field of quantum physics, therefore, our expectations of how things should and could behave can break down. It might even seem like a warning against giving too much weight to our intuitions when drawing conclusions about the structure of the world. For Rovelli, however, who works with this scale of reality everyday, things have started to become familiar. He&rsquo;s developed an intuitive skill for predicting and describing phenomena at this level. But it has to be a process, of appealing to evidence to check to see if intuitions can really stick.</p> <p>&ldquo;So we have to filter, analyse, go back, check, be critical, to filter out the good products of our intuition,&rdquo; Rovelli says. &ldquo;Failing to do so is to be a crackpot, a useless dreamer, it is to lose the way. Humanity has done everything it has precisely because it has navigated smartly between intuition and critical thinking.&rdquo;</p> <p>History is filled with examples where a scientist&rsquo;s intuition has taken them beyond the accepted body of knowledge and revolutionised how we understood the world. In his book <em>Helgoland</em>, Rovelli details the intellectual journey of Werner Heisenberg in his development of quantum theory, a journey that involved stepping outside the confines of accepted thought, and following a hunch of his own.</p> <p>By focusing on the subatomic quantities of particles that were observable, such as the energy an atom emits when electrons jump, Heisenberg made it possible to build a consistent theory of the atomic world. At the forefronts of human knowledge, such as in the world of quantum physics, a carefully honed sense of intuition can make the difference between a great scientist and a genius.</p> <p>Sara Walker is an astrobiologist from Arizona State University. For the past decade she has been working to uncover &ldquo;laws of life&rdquo; to help guide our search for extraterrestrial life. Recently, Walker has been developing a theory called &ldquo;assembly theory&rdquo;, which aims to describe the conditions where selective processes emerge and abiotic chemistry transitions into chemistry that we might call living.</p> <p>Essentially, Walker is trying to build a physical theory that can describe the difference between living things and non-living things. She hopes the theory could be used as a barometer in our search for extraterrestrial life, if we encounter life that is vastly different to the types we are familiar with. She also hopes assembly theory could help identify the moment in Earth&rsquo;s deep past where geochemical cycles transitioned into the first living organisms. </p> <p>Walker, like Rovelli, acknowledges that we have to be careful when it comes to intuition. It&rsquo;s easy to confuse it with &ldquo;common sense&rdquo;, she points out.</p> <p>We once knew &ldquo;intuitively&rdquo; that the Earth was the centre of the cosmos, and that time moved in a universally linear direction. It&rsquo;s easy for concepts that seem like the natural conclusion to make, based on our understanding of the world at the time, to become &ldquo;deeply rooted in our psyche, and then it becomes hard for us to change the paradigm because we have been taught to accept the world as a certain way.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Jewels and garbage</h2> <p>It could be argued, then, that science is the enemy of intuition. Scientists have consistently proven our &ldquo;intuitions&rdquo; about the structure of the physical world to be wrong. But rather than being a mode of thinking that only leads us to drawing false conclusions about reality, intuition can help us when we step out into the unknown, where we don&rsquo;t have observation and theory available to guide our decision making. It can therefore be a corrective force, one that helps us see things in a new light when we are too far down the rabbit hole.</p> <p>Walker believes that making use of new intuitions is useful, even crucial, when it comes to breaking ground in relatively new fields like her own or Rovelli&rsquo;s. Astrobiologists are involved in speculating about life that could be completely different to Earth-based life, stepping out into a territory that is untethered from previous models. &ldquo;When you are coming up with new concepts to try to figure out fields we don&rsquo;t yet understand, intuition becomes really important to help map out that foreign territory,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s relevant in astrobiology now because astrobiology has leading edge questions that we don&rsquo;t fully understand.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Usually we go off our observations or historical knowledge,&rdquo; she adds, &ldquo;but they are obviously not always accurate. We have had inaccurate models for a long time and the whole point of science is to build a deeper, more powerful model.&rdquo;</p> <p>While our intuition may stem from our subconscious experience of the world, its intangible nature no doubt plays a crucial role in the unfurling narrative of our attempts to understand ourselves and the world around us. It might be tempting to distance science from intuitive thinking, since our intuitions about the world are so often misguided. To admit that one of our greatest inventions &ndash; the scientific method &ndash; is subject to what might seem like a flash from the dark or a wandering whim could seem like an admission of epistemological frailty. Especially when we are still trying to understand the mysterious nature from which these very whims emerge.</p> <p>But that would be a mischaracterisation of the role that intuition can serve within science. Intuition is what humanises science, and what separates great scientists from the rest. Like the experienced hiker, scientists draw on their intuition like a skill, one that can lead them to new worlds of understanding.</p> <p>It can seem like a contradiction. The correct use of intuition has been at the heart of many of the great leaps forward in the history of science. But in order for it to be useful, its limits have to be understood. As Rovelli puts it, &ldquo;The point is not to be fooled by intuition. It is our most powerful tool for creativity, but it is often very wrong. It gives us jewels, but only rarely. Most of the time it gives us garbage.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Shy-527x815.jpg" height="490" alt="The cover art from 'Shy' shows the silhouette of a boy" width="527"></strong></p> <p><strong>Shy (Faber &amp; Faber)</strong> by Max Porter</p> <p>Creeping down a corridor at night, spliff safely stowed, Walkman in hand, avoiding the squeaky floorboards, a deeply troubled 16-year-old boy is running away. There is a lot to run away from. The title character of the novel <em>Shy</em> is making a chaotic escape from Last Chance &ndash; a countryside boarding house for &ldquo;very disturbed young men&rdquo;. As he wanders into the mid-1990s night air, a tangle of voices, memories and emotions tear through him.</p> <p>In the course of the novel, we see Shy&rsquo;s ability to unleash violence, his sexual misadventures, the knife-edge teeter into manic episodes, the precise pressure-cooker blend of frustration and turmoil known only to his see-sawing mind &ndash; they are all visited upon him as he stumbles and remembers and ponders. This short book can be read as the third of a trilogy by Max Porter that explores childhood and the yawning chasms of potential horror that love and parenthood can expose us to when catastrophe occurs.</p> <p>His first novel, <em>Grief Is the Thing With Feathers</em>, relates the harrowing death of a young mother and the impact on her partner and two sons. The second, <em>Lanny</em>, explores the impact on parents, friends and the wider community when a young child goes missing. In <em>Shy</em>, the all-consuming nightmare of a young person morphing from an apparently happy child into an unpredictable and troubled teenager deftly brings home not just the desperate rollercoaster that the individual may be on, but also the enormity of what families in this not-uncommon scenario can be grappling with.</p> <p>In one heartbreaking flashback to the not-too-distant past, Shy recalls his mother and stepfather bribing him with a packet of cigarettes to join them watching the camcorder videos they made of his childhood &ndash; a happy boy playing and singing in the summer sunshine. Of course, the tactic cannot bring back what has been swept away. Back in the present we learn that Last Chance is to be closed and turned into luxury flats.</p> <p>Is Shy escaping the confines of the grounds, or is he dumping his home before it dumps him? The brute heartlessness of capitalism and governments&rsquo; obeisance to the market loom from every shadow in this book. But despite the dark subject matter, there is endless playfulness and bursts of joy &ndash; both an insight into Shy&rsquo;s frothing, giddy mind and of course, Porter&rsquo;s own form-busting creative flair.</p> <p>A book concerning the teenage nihilism of a white male protagonist brought up in a loving family could easily be dismissed as an exploration of &ldquo;first world problems&rdquo;, but Shy&rsquo;s extreme behaviour and profound mental health issues put him beyond this unhelpful label and invite a mature discussion about the chronic malaise masculinity finds itself in today. Shy and his contemporaries at Last Chance may be steeped in Lynx Africa and spend their days trading puerile sexual insults &ndash; but they are also a perfect reminder of how fundamentally compromised as individuals, and as a society, we have been by generations of male omerta around basic emotional articulation, let alone mental health issues.</p> <p>Porter&rsquo;s discipline-blurring mixture of broken and mashed-up prose, poetry and page layout experimentation was used to good effect in his previous books &ndash; particularly in his dramatic fictional account of the last moments of the artist Francis Bacon&rsquo;s life. It seems even more suited to describing the bipolar oscillations, drug-induced pace changes and snapping viewpoints of a teenage mind on the cusp of violence or psychosis. The narrative builds in intensity like a panic attack &ndash; new dimensions of unexpected awfulness sloshing into an already overflowing vessel.</p> <p>Porter gives articulation to the inarticulate, wires us into the fluctuating private meditations of a young man in the grip of a mental health crisis in prose which flowers into a stunning display of empathic prowess. Shy shows us how the ripples of sickness on the surface of civilisation not only spread out in damaging concentric circles, but can also reveal the wild undercurrents beneath &ndash; those ancient churning forces still warping the world we live in.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>I am delighted to say that the second series of our On Your Mind podcast has launched today!!</p>



<p>Each week, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will explore aspects of the human psyche, including astrology, how the clothes we wear influence our thoughts, attraction, friendship, dreaming, mind control and much much more.  We will also be joined by some special guests as we attempt to answer all of your questions about psychology. The first series reached No.1 in Apple Podcast’s Science charts, and so we hope that you can join us. </p>



<p>Our first episode looks at creativity and explores how to have good ideas and whether children are more creative than adults. You can listen <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2txmeCf9U2rj4aAdMLoczK">here</a>.</p>

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks to Podimo and TellTale studios for supporting and producing the podcast.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->
