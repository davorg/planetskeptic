            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">This weekend, Peter Thiel and various right-wing think tanks backed something called the <a href="https://cli.stanford.edu/events/conference-symposium/academic-freedom-conference">Academic Freedom Conference</a>. You can guess what this was all about.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Academic freedom, open inquiry, and freedom of speech are under threat as they have not been for decades. Visibly, academics are “canceled,” fired, or subject to lengthy disciplinary proceedings in response to academic writing or public engagement. Less visibly, funding agencies, university bureaucracies, hiring procedures, promotion committees, professional organizations, and journals censor some kinds of research or demand adherence to political causes. Many parts of universities have become politicized or have turned into ideological monocultures, excluding people, ideas, or kinds of work that challenge their orthodoxy. Younger researchers are afraid to speak and write and don’t investigate promising ideas that they fear will endanger their careers. </p>
<p>The two-day Academic Freedom Conference, arranged by the organizing committee, aims to identify ways to restore academic freedom, open inquiry, and freedom of speech and expression on campus and in the larger culture and restore the open debate required for new knowledge to flourish. The conference will focus on the organizational structures leading to censorship and stifling debate and how to repair them. </p></blockquote>
<p>All you have to do is look at the list of speakers and see that it&#8217;s a conference of far-right kooks and their enablers. Oh, look: there&#8217;s Jordan Peterson, Douglas Murray, Gad Saad, Niall Ferguson, Bjorn Lomborg, Jay Bhattacharya, John Ioannidis, and a horde of disgraced academics, bigots, Quillette authors, misogynists, vaccine deniers, and cranks. Several of the people there have publicly professed their support for good science (usually to defend garbage science), but then the <a href="https://www.pinkerite.com/2022/11/is-peter-thiel-insane.html">keynote by Peter Thiel</a> is an embarrassing anti-science rant. Also mostly rambling and incoherent.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>So you you have the string theory people telling us how wonderful string theory people are and how everybody else just has bad math genes and can&#8217;t talk about it. We have the uh the cancer researchers promising us they will cure cancer in five years which they&#8217;ve been doing for the last 50. We have um and on and on in all these sort of hyper hyper specialized areas and um and then the question is, you know how much how much progress is actually happening? </p>
<p>The um, these sort of indirect intuitions I have on where it seems very very slowed, are things like,  umm, if you if you if you look at things like um, the the economy, the the standards of living among younger people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Except that cancer researchers say no such thing &#8212; the most common idea I see expressed by cancer researchers is that cancer is a thousand different diseases with hundreds of alternative pathways, and that there will be no magic bullet. All he&#8217;s got to go on is &#8220;indirect intuitions&#8221;. He&#8217;s an idiot. Then he makes similarly stupid statements about education.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Um and that&#8217;s probably the political intuition we should have about the sciences versus uh versus the humanities. The, the, the, the polemical version of it that I, I had once was that you know I I think um I think that uh it&#8217;s better for undergraduates to meh meh to major in the humanities rather than the sciences. Set computer sciences, aside, as the one thing that sort of works, but everything else. Because um in the humanities you at least know you&#8217;re not going to get a job, you&#8217;ll be unemployable, whereas in the sciences you have people who are so deluded as to believe that we&#8217;ll be taken care of by the natural goodness of the universe. And it&#8217;s just it is just a Malthusian competition.</p></blockquote>
<p>You hear that? The only topic that matters is computer science, because that&#8217;s the only one that will land you a job &#8212; which isn&#8217;t true, and also isn&#8217;t the one reason to get education. Scientists don&#8217;t have this illusion that the universe has &#8220;natural goodness&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to imagine how any of the scientists in the audience could listen to that drivel without rising up and walking out. But don&#8217;t worry, there was no drama: the kinds of people who would attend such a conference are pre-selected for being gullible conservative loons. Even more, I can&#8217;t imagine anyone <em>accepting</em> an invitation to an even packed so heavily with horrible people like Thiel or Peterson or that roster of denialists and bigots, as summarized in <a href="https://www.pinkerite.com/2022/10/peter-thiels-cpac-for-racists.html">this list</a> or <a href="https://www.pinkerite.com/2022/10/peter-thiels-cpac-for-racists-tight.html">this one</a>. Yet there sat marginally respectable people like Steve Pinker and Jon Haidt and Jerry Coyne, who have often fucked up and are now confirming their deplorable status by <em>enthusiastically</em> attending. Ick.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinkerite.com/2022/10/peter-thiels-cpac-for-racists-update.html">Coyne predicted ahead of time that he&#8217;d be labeled with guilt by association</a>. He&#8217;s right.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>I predict that the mainstream media and many on social media will deem the entire conference a conclave of bigots, racists, and transphobes because a few people on the schedule have been called those names. Indeed, Steve Pinker himself has been the object of criticism, and has been called a racist; and I (deemed “someone with a solid reputation who speaks his mind and is honest in his arguments”) have also been called a transphobe and a racist. Hardly anybody is immune!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Correct. If you hob-nob with transphobes, racists, and bigots, and you applaud their words, and trumpet how much you agree with the sentiments they express, then surprise! People will draw the reasonable conclusion that you are a fellow traveler. That&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p>By the way, I was briefly mentioned (negatively, I&#8217;m proud to say) at the conference. Coyne condemned me for being &#8220;ideological&#8221; that he neglected to do for all the flamingly ideological speakers at the event.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/coynes-claim.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/coynes-claim-500x823.png" alt="" width="500" height="823" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68407" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/coynes-claim-500x823.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/coynes-claim-91x150.png 91w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/coynes-claim-182x300.png 182w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/coynes-claim-768x1265.png 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/coynes-claim.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>He has done this <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/09/01/jerry-coyne-gets-everything-wrong-again/">multiple times</a> in <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/07/15/when-in-doubt-just-question-the-motives-of-evolutionary-psychology-critics/">the past</a>, and never pays any attention to corrections. Every time, he pretends that my beef is with the idea that <q>our brains, as well as our body, show traces of our ancestry over the past 6 million years</q>. That&#8217;s a lie, just an outright lie. It doesn&#8217;t matter that I&#8217;ve repeatedly said that I&#8217;m a hardcore materialist who accepts the idea of humanity evolving entirely by natural mechanisms, he has decided, as a rhetorical strategy, that since he can&#8217;t address my actual criticisms, he&#8217;s going to misrepresent my position. Every time. It&#8217;s pretty damned disgraceful. As I&#8217;ve written before:</p>
<blockquote><p>The brain is a material product of evolution, and behavior is a product of the brain. There are natural causes for everything all the way down. And further, I have great respect for psychology, evolutionary biology, ethology, physiology, anthropology, anatomy, comparative biology — and I consider all of those disciplines to have strong integrative ties to evolutionary biology. Does Coyne really believe that I am critiquing the evolved nature of the human brain? Because otherwise, this is a completely irrelevant statement.</p>
<p>Evolutionary psychology has its own special methodology and logic, and that’s what I criticize — not anthropology or evolutionary biology or whatever. Somehow these unique properties get conveniently jettisoned whenever a critic wanders by, only to be re-adopted without reservation within the exercise of the discipline. And that’s really annoying.</p>
<p>What I object to in evolutionary psychology is that their stock in trade is to make observations of behavior in a single species, often in a single population, and then to infer an evolutionary history from that data point. You don’t get to do that. It’s not that the observations are invalid (they’re often interesting in their own right), or that it’s not possible that human behaviors carry a strong genetic component — it’s that you simply can’t draw an evolutionary conclusion from the simple existence of a trait in a population. Yet evolutionary psychologists do, all the time.</p></blockquote>
<p>His only approach is to poison the well. So now I&#8217;m a <q>blank slater</q> and a Marxist, neither accusation being true.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>It&#8217;s again, comes out of the ideology that we&#8217;re blank slates. I think that comes from Marxism, where people are seen as infinitely malleable by the social environment. Whereas evolutionary psychology tells us that we&#8217;re not blank slates that we&#8217;re born with a little bit of writing on those blank slates, that can be changed a bit, but can only be changed within certain limits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you know that there are negligibly few biologists who believe we have no genetic predispositions? This whole <q>blank slate</q> nonsense is Pinker&#8217;s conceit, his default straw man, and it&#8217;s transparently bogus. It&#8217;s always fun to encounter someone who attacks you by announcing that you hold a ridiculous opinion that you&#8217;ve never held and are happy to agree that it&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>I do wonder how his audience received that claim that it&#8217;s blank slaters who think people are infinitely malleable by the social environment when there are a bunch of transphobes there who think that everyone&#8217;s sexual identity is so easily corrupted by the social environment, believing in garbage like <q>rapid onset gender dysphoria</q>. Is gender fluid in some people or not?</p>
<p>He also claims that evolutionary psychology has <q>produced many valuable insights, such as differences in sexual behavior between men and women</q>. What are those insights? That women are better at spotting pink berries or something? He doesn&#8217;t say.</p>
<p>Again, my gripe with EP is methodological: you can&#8217;t make &#8220;valuable insights&#8221; about human evolution with surveys and experiments on modern American undergraduates.</p>

<p class="lead">I was going to vote on Tuesday morning, but my wife persuaded me to get it done early and submit our ballots today. Usually the polling places are quiet and empty, even during a presidential election, since this is a very small town…but maybe my wife knows something I don&#8217;t. I dropped the ballots off at 2pm on a Friday, and…</p>
<p>There was a <em>line</em> at the county courthouse of people doing the same thing.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had to wait in line to vote in 20 years. OK, sometimes I&#8217;m second in line, but waiting times are negligible. Still, this is the longest delay ever. I&#8217;m going to have to complain to someone.</p>
<p>This is a red county, so don&#8217;t assume this means the DFL is going to triumph &#8212; in fact, one little group of women in line were members of the apostolic cult in town (easy to spot, long hair in a bun, long skirts) and I&#8217;d be surprised if they were voting for anything other than conservative theocracy. But I <em>could</em> be surprised, it&#8217;s a secret ballot after all, maybe there is a revolution brewing.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/early-vote">Over 35 million votes have already been submitted</a>, mostly from registered Democrats. The MAGA crowd is going to be complaining again.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Back in the day when I was a naive young man, the news would occasionally run stories about the Future of Humanity, and predict where evolution was going to take us. It was usually a destiny of feeble, shriveled bodies and gigantic domed heads, but there were recent variants. Wall-E instead suggested humans were all going to become obese, trapped in motorized wheelchairs. Or look to <i>Idiocracy</i>, which instead predicts we&#8217;re going to be selecting for crass stupidity. You should realize that these are not scientific predictions at all, they are merely cautionary tales conjured up by creators who are telling us about themselves &#8212; that they find eggheads and fat people and stupid people repellent, for instance. It&#8217;s both ugly and unscientific, because no, evolutionary biologists are not going to make long term predictions about the trajectory of evolution, because selection is a short term and local process.</p>
<p>Are you ready for the next generation of inane predictions? Oh boy, they are at least going in a different direction. Behold Mindy, our destiny, if we continue to do things the artist doesn&#8217;t like very much.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/Mindy-Detailed-Image.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/Mindy-Detailed-Image-500x590.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="590" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68395" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/Mindy-Detailed-Image-500x590.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/Mindy-Detailed-Image-127x150.jpg 127w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/Mindy-Detailed-Image-254x300.jpg 254w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/Mindy-Detailed-Image.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>You might be wondering how they came up with this remarkable portrait. &#8220;Researchers&#8221; were commissioned to create a model.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Researchers worked with a 3D designer to create images of a “future human” that accounts for all of the problems long-term tech use may cause.</p></blockquote>
<p>That does not explain who these &#8220;researchers&#8221; are. I read through the original source, and it seems to have been Professor Google. They rummaged around through various sites that complain about modern ills &#8212; I found some New Age sources, some crank medical sites, and some legit medical sources that talk about the perils of poor posture &#8212; and stitched them all together into a rationale for what evolution would favor, an invalid line of reasoning. It&#8217;s all entirely driven by contempt for people who use cell phones and do office work. As usual, it&#8217;s all about airing the creator&#8217;s ill-informed biases. So, if you look at your phone, you are warping the morphology of any progeny you might have! Stop it!</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Researchers predict that office work and craning the neck to look at smartphones will lead to humans having a hunched back in the future. Currently, many people consistently adjust their position to look down at their phones, or to look up at their office screens. </p></blockquote>
<p>If you sit in front of your computer, your grandchildren will grow up to be hunchbacks! At least, according to a holistic medicine guy.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Sitting in front of the computer at the office for hours on end also means that your torso is pulled out in front of your hips rather than being stacked straight and aligned,” says Caleb Backe, a health and wellness expert at Maple Holistics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using this logic, I guess if they&#8217;d hired &#8220;researchers&#8221; a hundred and fifty years ago to draw what humans would look like if we continued to employ chimney sweeps, they&#8217;d have predicted small thin people with armored skin and flexible joints and extra eyelids…oh, look, these guys also predicted extra eyelids to filter out blue light that disrupts sleep patterns, because of course evolution is all about conveniently delivering exactly what you need.</p>
<p>Are you ready for the disclosure of who actually commissioned this work? It&#8217;s a company called &#8220;Toll Free Forwarding&#8221; which is using it to promote their cell phone service with sensationalist bullshit.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistLaurieLimbosmall.jpg" height="1281" alt="Laurie Taylor cartoon by Martin Rowson" width="1636"></p> <p>Several of my ageing friends are moving house. Ian McDonald, who always seemed as much a part of Chelsea as the King&rsquo;s Road, is upping sticks and heading for a largely unpronounceable dwelling in the north of Scotland. Meanwhile, Geoff Holdsworth, who always appeared as settled in Soho as The French House, emails me to say that he is returning to his roots in Leicester. One can readily understand these moves as a desire for a second childhood. Having been out in the big wide world for most of their adult lives, these good old friends of mine are now saying goodbye to the supposed artificialities of London life and returning to what they conceive of as the simple authenticity of their formative years.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m unlikely to follow them. Not because I lack sentiment about my childhood homes. I can readily conjure up happy visions of walking through the vast open spaces of Sutton Park or taking a bracing dip in the brown waters of the River Mersey after a picnic on Crosby beach. But I&rsquo;m now far too old to imagine that I might be allowed to enjoy the indulgence of any more lifetime experiences. This is my last life on Earth.</p> <p>This, of course, is the whole problem with atheism. It robs you of the delightful possibility of an after-life. I believed years ago, with an absolute Catholic certainty, that my final days would not be spent in a Scottish croft or a suburban Leicester villa, but in a resting place for my Christian soul. From an early age, I reckoned that place would be Purgatory &ndash; a realm reserved for minor sinners, and a relatively pleasing prospect when compared to its infernal alternative.</p> <p>However, in Catholic theology, it was not a particularly well-defined location. Heaven, by comparison, was well documented. There would be clouds to sit upon, harps to strum and a diet of milk and honey to be enjoyed in the blessed company of saints and martyrs.Hell, if one excludes Dante&rsquo;s poetical cornucopia of horrors, was even more straightforward. It was hot. Very, very hot. Burning hot. But not quite hot enough to consume you and thereby end your suffering. Purgatory, though, lacked all such detail. There was no promise of happy harpists or fork-tongued devils, but only the prospect of a somewhat barren landscape in which you were required to wait and wait until your sentence was deemed to have been served, your sins to have been purged.</p> <p>The great problem with Purgatory was the length of that sentence. It was not eternal, like Heaven and Hell. One could hardly go on being purged for ever. But were we talking months or years or decades? Fortunately, there was some clarification in the Catholic catechism. Here, one learned that the regular recital of certain prayers and regular attendance at acts of devotion might reduce your sentence by an explicit number of days. Three carefully recited rosaries earned an indulgence &ndash; a time-off for good behaviour bonus &ndash; of precisely 28 days. There it was, in neat brackets, in my personal catechism. I can clearly recall the childhood years when I would systematically tot up these indulgences in order to effect a speedier transit to eternal bliss.</p> <p>As an unbeliever, thankfully, I have one last hope of securing eternal life in Paradise: entrance into Limbo. According to Catholic teaching, this is a special part of Hell for those who were born before the birth of Christ. These unfortunate individuals never had the opportunity of gaining the usual visa requirements by being baptised into the true faith. Now, I was hardly born before the birth of Christ. However, according to my mother, I was baptised by a rather simple-minded and somewhat tipsy priest who apparently announced at the service that &ldquo;Florence&rdquo; Taylor was now &ldquo;a child of Christ&rdquo;.</p> <p>Might that mere slip of the tongue get me off the hook? Detach me from the devil&rsquo;s fork? Allow God to overlook all my years of disbelief and blasphemy and unrelenting sinfulness? Usher me into Paradise? I&rsquo;ll do my level best to let you know.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistQuantamComputer.jpg" height="841" alt="Martin Rowson cartoon on quantum computers" width="1000"></p> <p class="p1">It&rsquo;s 2042. A schoolgirl sits in her bedroom and sets her computer a problem. It splits into trillions upon trillions of copies of itself, each of which works on a separate strand. After only a few seconds, they all come back together and a single answer pops up on the screen. It is an answer that would have taken the fastest supercomputer in the world more than the age of the Universe to obtain. Satisfied that her homework is done, the girl shuts down her computer and goes out to play. This, in a nutshell, is a quantum computer.</p> <p class="p3">Quantum computers have the potential to change the world as profoundly as electricity did. &ldquo;If you imagine the difference between an abacus and the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputer&rdquo;, said BBC journalist Julian Brown, &ldquo;you would still not have the barest inkling of how much more powerful a quantum computer could be compared with the computers we have today.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Currently, all we have in laboratories around the world are stepping-stones on the road to building a useful quantum computer. The holy grail would be a general-purpose machine that could solve any conceivable problem in a fraction of the time of a conventional computer. But even if this proves impossible to achieve, we could still develop a more limited type of quantum computer that could, for instance, discover new drugs without the need for time-consuming and costly trials. The expectation is that one or other of these kinds of quantum computer could be with us within only 10 to 15 years.</p> <p class="p3">So, how do they work? Either a quantum computer behaves <em>as if</em> it exploits trillions upon trillions of copies of itself in parallel universes, or it actually does. Most physicists believe the former. However, one of the pioneers of quantum computing, David Deutsch of the University of Oxford, believes the quantum computer is something entirely new: the first device ever built that exploits parallel universes, or realities. He has a good reason for believing this. But first, some necessary background on quantum theory and how it makes possible quantum computers.</p> <h2 class="p4">Weird waves</h2> <p class="p5">Quantum theory is our best description of the submicroscopic world of atoms and their constituents. Experiments in the early 20th century revealed something scarcely believable about electrons, photons and all the building blocks of matter: they can behave both as particles (like tiny billiard balls) and waves (like ripples on a pond). The waves are peculiar: they are mathematical entities which are imagined to spread through space according to the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. Where the waves are big, there is a high chance of finding a particle such as an electron, and where they are small, there is a low chance.</p> <p class="p3">It follows that particles can do all the things that waves can. Imagine the sea on a stormy day. Big rolling waves are marching across it. Now imagine the next day when the storm has passed. The gentle breeze is driving small ripples. If you have ever looked closely at waves at sea, you will know that it is possible to have big rolling waves whose surface is rippled by the wind. This is a general property of all waves. If two or more waves are possible, so too is a combination.</p> <p class="p3">Now imagine a quantum wave that represents an oxygen atom and which is highly peaked on one side of a room (so there is an almost 100 per cent chance of finding it there) and another quantum wave that represents the same oxygen atom that is highly peaked on the other side of a room (so there is an almost 100 per cent chance of <em>also </em>finding it there). Remember, if any two waves can exist, so too can a combination. In this case, it represents the oxygen atom on both sides of the room at the same time. Bizarre as it seems, a quantum particle can not only be in more than one place at a time, they can also do more than one thing at a time. So, atoms and their constituents can do many things at once. A quantum computer simply exploits this ability in order to do many calculations at once.</p> <h2 class="p4">More calculations than fundamental particles</h2> <p class="p5">I first came across the term quantum computer in 1983 while at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and taking a series of lectures by Richard Feynman. Feynman had worked on the atomic bomb and won the Nobel Prize for Quantum Electrodynamics (and he played the bongos). At the time, he was recovering from cancer surgery so was indulged by the Caltech faculty and allowed to teach whatever he liked. His course was called &ldquo;Potentialities and Limitations of Computers&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">Feynman was interested in the ultimate physical limits of computers &ndash; how small components could be made, how fast, and so on. At the time, a transistor &ndash; the basic component of a computer &ndash; consisted of about 100 billion atoms. Nowadays, it is down to about 25,000. But Feynman realised miniaturisation would ultimately result in transistors made of single atoms, at which point they would dance to the tune of quantum theory. This would be a new kind of beast, he realised: a quantum computer.</p> <p class="p3">Whereas a normal computer consists of transistors, each of which represents a bit (a 0 or a 1, depending on whether the transistor allows an electric current through or not), a quantum computer consists of quantum bits, or qubits, each of which can represent a 0 and a 1 at the same time. Consequently, a qubit can be involved in two calculations simultaneously (one in which it is a 0, and another in which it is a 1). A pair of qubits can represent four possibilities simultaneously (01, 11, 10, 00) and so can be involved in four calculations at once; three cubits, eight calculations; and so on.</p> <p class="p3">The power of a quantum computer becomes clear. With each additional bit, a normal computer increases its power only marginally. With each extra qubit, the power of a quantum computer doubles. Very quickly, such an exponential growth in computing power beats into submission even the biggest supercomputers.</p> <p class="p5">Here is another way to appreciate the power of quantum computing. In 1965, Gordon Moore, head of the American chip manufacturer Intel, realised that computing power &ndash; the number of bits a computer can process, the number of bits it can store in its memory, and so on &ndash; was doubling roughly every two years. This has been going on since 1949 and is known as Moore&rsquo;s Law. Contrast this with the number of qubits available, which is doubling roughly every five years. Perhaps this appears less impressive. But, remember, each additional qubit doubles the power of a quantum computer. Quantum computers are therefore increasing their power as an exponential of an exponential. To put it another way, after four Moore&rsquo;s-Law-doublings, a conventional computer would be 16 times as powerful, whereas a quantum computer would be about 64,000 times as powerful.</p> <p class="p3">Currently, the record-holding quantum computer, announced by IBM in November 2021, has 120 qubits, almost doubling the number of qubits of the previous record-holder, built by Google. If a quantum computer were built that could manipulate a mere 270 qubits, however, it would reach a critical threshold: it would be able to do more calculations simultaneously than there are fundamental particles in the universe.</p> <p class="p3">This is why Deutsch thinks it is legitimate to ask: <em>where</em> is the quantum computer doing its calculations? The universe does not have the physical resources. Your computer, after all, can do only the calculations for which it has sufficient memory. Deutsch&rsquo;s answer is that the quantum computer exploits physical resources in parallel universes. It is a device, he claims, that literally forces us to take seriously such universes.</p> <p class="p3">Among other things, a general-purpose quantum computer might deliver true superior-to-human intelligence. But we face some challenges when it comes to creating a useful quantum computer.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">What problems could a quantum computer actually solve?</span></h2> <p class="p3">Firstly, in order to function, quantum systems need to operate in total isolation. This is because qubits are fragile and lose their ability to do many things at once if they are impacted by their surroundings. While it&rsquo;s relatively simple to isolate a single atom in a vacuum, it is harder with larger systems. The solution is to hold the qubits &ndash; which may be atoms or electrons or some other kind of quantum object &ndash; in an extreme vacuum so air molecules do not bounce off them, and to keep them cooled to close to absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, so &ldquo;photons&rdquo; of heat do not bounce off them.</p> <p class="p3">But this is impossible to do perfectly. There will always be stray air molecules and photons of light bouncing off qubits, causing them to lose their quantumness and &ldquo;decohere&rdquo; into normal bits. This can be corrected for; but each qubit requires anything from 10 to 100 qubits for the &ldquo;error correction&rdquo;. A conventional computer develops an error &ndash; a 0 flipping to a 1 or vice versa &ndash; about once every trillion trillion operations. The quantum computers under construction today develop an error about once every 1,000 operations. This is crippling, and makes it hard for these computers to perform even limited useful calculations.</p> <p class="p3">So, while IBM&rsquo;s quantum computer uses the most qubits of any existing prototype, most of these are needed simply for the task of error correction. To surmount this challenge, error correction would need to outpace the accumulation of errors &ndash; but it&rsquo;s unclear whether this will ever be possible.</p> <p class="p5">Once we&rsquo;ve built a powerful quantum computer, we would then be faced with the challenge of giving it useful tasks. A quantum computer operates by splitting into trillions upon trillions of copies of itself, each of which works on a separate strand of the same calculation. In the end, the strands come back together and the computer spits out a single answer. It is not possible to access these separate strands, as that would entail interacting with the quantum computer, destroying its quantumness. Put bluntly, it is very hard to find problems that require lots of parallel calculations that spit out a single answer.</p> <p class="p3">Nevertheless, in 1994, Peter Shor found just such a problem. He realised that a quantum computer could, in theory, break the RSA code used to encrypt all banking and internet data. RSA encryption relies on something that is easy to do but extremely hard to undo. It is easy to take two very big &ldquo;prime&rdquo; numbers and multiply them together, but is hard to take such a big number and find its prime factors. The security of an encrypted message relies on the fact that it would take centuries, even on the fastest supercomputer, for the code-breaker to find those prime factors. Shor showed that a quantum computer could achieve this in a split second.</p> <p class="p3">Shor&rsquo;s algorithm made people sit up. It did not matter that in 1994 no quantum computer existed that could implement the algorithm. The point was that the moment a working quantum computer was built, every piece of secret information exchanged in the world would be readable. There are rumours that intelligence agencies and criminals have long been harvesting financial and internet data in anticipation of that day.</p> <p class="p3">It could turn out that useful algorithms like Shor&rsquo;s are rare, and that it will never be possible to build a quantum computer capable of attacking a wide range of practical problems such as code-breaking. We may never be able to build a quantum computer powerful enough to create true artificial intelligence.</p> <h2 class="p4">Understanding how particles behave</h2> <p class="p5">Nevertheless, quantum computers could still change the world beyond recognition. This is because there is one thing that a quantum computer can certainly do: it can simulate a quantum system, thus predicting how it behaves. In fact, it was for this purpose that Feynman first envisioned a quantum computer in 1983.</p> <p class="p3">When it comes to how our world works, we are certain of very little. Physicists never like to admit that they have solved only one problem <em>exactly</em>: the two-body problem. They can predict, for example, the way in which an electron orbits a proton in the simplest (hydrogen) atom; or the way the Moon loops around the Earth. Everything else in physics is approximation. For instance, when more electrons are added to an atom, the behaviour of each electron depends on the behaviour of all the others and it quickly becomes impossible for even supercomputers to model.</p> <p class="p3">However, the behaviour of every atom and molecule depends on the arrangement of its electrons. It is via these that it interacts with the world. The electron arrangement determines its chemistry &ndash; how it conducts heat, electricity and so on. But we cannot predict the behaviour of any multi-electron system because we can only solve the two-body problem exactly. But a quantum computer could.</p> <p class="p3">Understanding how atoms and subatomic particles behave could have useful practical applications. Currently, we have to do drug trials because we cannot predict how drug molecules will behave in the body. But, with a quantum computer, we could circumvent all this and predict the behaviour of millions of potential drugs without having to do expensive and time-consuming trials.</p> <p class="p3">Smartphones and Tesla electric cars have been made possible by the development of lithium-ion batteries, which store a lot of energy in a small volume. But the world is running short of lithium. And finding new and better substances to act as batteries involves synthesising and testing thousands of upon thousands of potential molecules. It is expensive and time-consuming. However, with a quantum computer it would be possible to predict the behaviour of millions upon millions of molecules in advance, and so improve on lithium-ion batteries.</p> <p class="p5">Another application could help us to make farming more sustainable. About 40 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population depends on wheat, which requires fertiliser. But that relies on the Haber-Bosch process, which takes nitrogen from the air and puts it in ammonia, the basis of fertilisers. The trouble is that this process uses lots of energy &ndash; as much as the airline industry. In fact, 40 per cent of the carbon footprint of a loaf of bread comes from this process.</p> <p class="p3">Thankfully, Haber-Bosch is not the only game in town. Plants, in their roots, use bacteria which can efficiently take nitrogen out of the air. They do it with an enzyme called nitrogenase. However, nitrogenase has thus far been too complicated for us to understand. If we could understand how it worked by simulating it on a quantum computer, we could not only mimic its process but even improve on it. That would mean we could dispense with the hugely inefficient and energy-hungry Haber-Bosch process, which would have a huge impact on reducing the emissions behind global warming.</p> <p class="p3">We may never be able to make a general-purpose quantum computer capable of giving us access to superior-to-human intelligence. Even so, the world could still be changed beyond all recognition by quantum computers able to perform even limited calculations, revolutionising the fields of medicine, agriculture and technology &ndash; and this might be only the start. And if a general-purpose quantum computer<em> is</em> possible, all bets are off.</p> <p class="p3"><span class="s2"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></span></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Symptoms of this &ldquo;melancholy delirium&rdquo; might include fever, disturbed sleep, palpitations, loss of appetite and anxiety. The Germans had a word for it: <em>heimweh</em> or &ldquo;home-woe&rdquo;. But Hofer coined a new medical term from the Greek <em>nostos</em>, meaning a homecoming, and <em>algos</em>, denoting pain. He called it nostalgia: an unassuageable grief for a lost homeland.</p> <p class="p4">The meaning of nostalgia may have changed, but two original and remarkable new books explore how Hofer&rsquo;s insight might resonate today in an age of mass migration and resurgent nationalism. Both dig deep into difficult questions around identity and belonging.</p> <p class="p4"><em>Exiles: Three Island Journeys</em> by William Atkins takes as its starting point the lives of three late 19th-century political exiles, each a figure of resistance and change. The French CommunardLouise Michel was transported to the Pacific island of New Caledonia. Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, a Zulu king, was exiled by the British to St Helena in the South Atlantic. And the Jewish Ukrainian revolutionary Lev Shternberg was sent to Sakhalin Island, off the coast of Siberia, by Tsarist Russia.</p> <p class="p4">Atkins&rsquo; primary interest is in how his subjects adapted to these ruptures in their lives. &ldquo;The thought of the distance kills us,&rdquo; one of Michel&rsquo;s fellow Communard exiles said. In later life, Shternberg taught ethnography in St Petersburg. His students described him as a man &ldquo;charred by some internal burning&rdquo;. Another exiled Communard &ldquo;died of grief at receiving no news from home&rdquo;. To be so unmoored was a kind of death-in-life.</p> <p class="p4">But you couldn&rsquo;t go back, even when you did, in fact, go back. For Dinuzulu, who adopted European clothing and manners during his eight years on St Helena, this was literally true. The defeated kingdom he left behind was broken up by the British, and he returned no longer a king, but as the governor of what was essentially a vassal territory, fractured by conflict and imperial taxation. And yet the land and its people were the source of his identity: &ldquo;the closer to his land he was allowed to be, the more powerful he grew,&rdquo; Atkins writes.</p> <p class="p4">Atkins visited the places he writes about. He searches for the traces his subjects left on the spaces they inhabited. But he is also exploring other kinds of exile and fracture, in particular the legacies of empire on these island prisons: the traumas that exiles and subject peoples might share. The indigenous Kanak of New Caledonia are still struggling today to free their country from French dominion. Atkins&rsquo; arrival coincides with a fractious independence vote, which the Kanak lost. He quotes the Kanak <br />independence campaigner Jean-Marie Tjibaou: &ldquo;The hardest thing is to stay alive and feel like a stranger in your own land.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p6">Imperial Europe transported immense numbers to its penal colonies. The British empire dispatched some 376,000, Tsarist Russia nearly two million. <em>Exiles</em>, then, is an intimate account of an epic phenomenon. Amaryllis Gacioppo&rsquo;s concern in <em>Motherlands: In Search of Our Inherited Cities </em>is more directly personal. Her starting point is the legacy of four generations of matrilineal migration within her family &ndash; in the 1920s from Turin to Benghazi, then part of Italian colonial Libya; from Benghazi to Palermo by way of Rome in the 1940s; from Palermo to the Sydney suburbs two decades later; and, for Gacioppo herself, a recent move from Australia, her place of birth, to Italy, a country that has both always and never been home to her.</p> <p class="p4">As Gacioppo traces these stories of displacement from city to city she explores wider ideas about dislocation and belonging. She recreates daily familial journeys and routines, trying to &ldquo;trigger a kind of temporal magic . . . [accessing] powers of memory or meaning or association&rdquo;. She is particularly interested in photographs and maps. A map of Allied bomb damage to Rome pales before the reality of a satellite photograph; but in colonial Benghazi it is the great-grandparents&rsquo; photos that seem unreal.</p> <p class="p4">Turin, Nietzsche said, is &ldquo;the first place where I am possible&rdquo;. If the goal of all migration is to find such a place, what of countries that make migrant lives impossible? In Rome, Gacioppo meets a woman campaigning for the rights of 1.5 million young Italians without citizenship, many of whom arrived in their infancy. They call themselves &ldquo;ghosts by law&rdquo;, denied a connection to their homeland&rsquo;s past, along with the certainty of a settled future.</p> <p class="p4">Gacioppo writes eloquently about the alienating dislocation of the <em>unheimlich</em> (literally, the unhomely) &ndash; what she calls &ldquo;a dispersal of the self, a confused state of inner unmooring&rdquo;. At the other end of the extreme, she visits the former SS headquarters in Rome, now a museum. In the cells, scratched into the walls, are the messages of the soon-to-be-tortured, soon-to-be-dead. &ldquo;Love Italy&rdquo;, one reads. &ldquo;Those who die for the homeland live for eternity&rdquo;, reads another. What is this idea of home, of place, that <br />belonging to it is more powerful than death?</p> <p class="p4">Mobility &ndash; migration, exile, colonisation &ndash; has always been part of the human condition. And the most meaningful kinds of belonging have nothing to do with borders or governments. &ldquo;[A] relationship to the land as a basis of cultural identity is one that echoes the beliefs and religions of native peoples all over the world,&rdquo; Gacioppo writes. But roots can also regrow. When Louise Michel returned to France from exile, she smuggled five cats out with her. They were, she said, &ldquo;something alive left from home&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p4">Both of these complex, thoughtful and deeply moving books also look towards the larger idea that, as Gacioppo writes, &ldquo;With each step forward into the future, something is lost, and this loss, the void created by it, travels with us. It is there to remind us that there is no such thing as returning.&rdquo; That is, the griefs of time, of separation, of mortality are another exile from which there is no return. If a true homecoming is impossible and this greater kind of exile haunts us all, who amongst us remains unbroken?</p> <p class="p4"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Pastafarians gather for a &ldquo;stand-in&rdquo; in Turin, 2015" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2EX5WMW.jpg" height="1000" alt="Pastafarians gather for a &ldquo;stand-in&rdquo; in Turin in 2015" width="1500" /></p> <p class="p1">One day in 2016, Derk Venema, a Dutch academic specialising in legal philosophy, was browsing the internet for examples of &ldquo;philosophically interesting questions about religious freedom&rdquo; to show his students. He came across the perfect case: a &ldquo;Pastafarian&rdquo;, or self-designated member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), was challenging the authorities for rejecting his driving licence photograph, in which he wore a colander on his head.</p> <p class="p3">Venema took a few students to watch the case before the local Chamber of Commerce. &ldquo;It was one of the most hilarious things I have ever witnessed,&rdquo; he says. Math&eacute; Coolen, the applicant, &ldquo;played his role excellently. Even the Commissioner was having a tough time not laughing.&rdquo; But when he spoke to Coolen afterwards, Venema realised that he was &ldquo;also very serious about the underlying questions, the questions about when and how administrative bodies get to decide what is a religion and what is not, and who gets to enjoy religious privileges and who doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">One of the students who accompanied Venema on his trip was Mienke de Wilde. She was so impressed by the case that she decided to become a Pastafarian herself. The next time she applied for a driving licence, she submitted a photo of herself wearing a colander. Her application was rejected. She appealed, claiming that Pastafarianism was a religion and her right to manifest it was protected under the European Convention on Human Rights. Venema took on her case and Coolen&rsquo;s; ultimately, it was de Wilde&rsquo;s alone that went all the way to the Dutch Administrative Court and then the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The court handed down judgment on 9 November last year. But before examining their conclusions, it is worth taking a step back to the origins of this strange &ldquo;religion&rdquo;.</p> <h2 class="p4">The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</h2> <p class="p5">In 2005, the Kansas School Board was considering whether to teach the theory of intelligent design alongside evolution. Bobby Henderson, a physics graduate from Oregon, wrote a now famous letter in which he claimed to believe that a &ldquo;Flying Spaghetti Monster&rdquo; created the world, and demanded that his theory be given equal time with the other two. He also claimed that &ldquo;global warming . . . and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Henderson had written the letter as satire. In doing so, however, he unexpectedly generated a meme. The internet was in its early days of cavalier freedom. Facebook had been founded the previous year and Twitter would be the next; chain emails were still a thing. At the same time, &ldquo;New Atheism&rdquo; was on the rise. Sam Harris had published <em>The End of Faith</em> in 2004, and contributions by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and Christopher Hitchens would soon follow. (Dennett later featured in the FSM documentary <em>I, Pastafari.</em>) It was fashionable among the godless youth to put &ldquo;Jedi&rdquo; as their religion on the UK census; 176,632 people did so in 2011. Parody was the flavour of the day. Pastafarianism went viral, and publishers rushed to sign Henderson up for a book contract.</p> <p class="p3">The result was <em>The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</em>, published by Villard less than six months before Dawkins&rsquo; <em>The God Delusion</em>. The<em> Gospel</em> according to Henderson is a picaresque series of pseudo-scientific rants, accompanied by diagrams and mock-formal logic, on topics from &ldquo;the need for alternative theories&rdquo; to &ldquo;a history of heretics&rdquo;. It is clearly designed to parody the attempts of evangelical Christians to co-opt science into supporting their literalist interpretation of the Bible.</p> <p class="p3">As a work of literature or philosophy, the <em>Gospel</em> has its limitations. In the words of Kathleen McEvoy, an Australian judge: &ldquo;At best the texts present ordinary moral admonitions and mundane articulations of principles of conduct present in the texts of most other established religions.&rdquo; Henderson himself, drawing a comparison with traditional scriptures, wrote that &ldquo;this book will stand up to any of the others &ndash; at least in terms of strict plausibility if not literary finesse and retributive beheadings and disembowelments.&rdquo; The book reportedly sold over 100,000 copies.</p> <p class="p3">Meanwhile, the memes of Pastafarianism have multiplied. A crucial moment in the Church&rsquo;s history came in 2011 in Austria, when Niko Alm was permitted to wear a colander in his driving licence photo &ndash; although only after a visit from a public health officer to check that he was sane. The police, who issued the licence, stated that &ldquo;the photo was not approved on religious grounds. The only criterion for photos in driving licence applications is that the whole face must be visible.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">This deftly sidestepped the underlying issue &ndash; but Alm&rsquo;s success led to a string of similar attempts around the world, including de Wilde&rsquo;s. Different authorities have responded in their own ways. In some places, often the more religious ones, the colander has been permitted, from the Czech Republic to Utah; in Poland, the Church of the FSM has been allowed to register as an official religion. In Belgium and Ireland, the colander has not made it through. In England in 2015, the DVLA rejected a colander photo by Ian Harris, described by the <em>Mail Online </em>as &ldquo;an eccentric man&rdquo;, because headgear was only &ldquo;permissible on religious or medical grounds&rdquo;. In Adelaide, Australia, Guy Albon had his guns confiscated after he submitted a colander photo for his licence, out of fears for his &ldquo;mental competency&rdquo;. More seriously, the Pastafarian Mikhail Iosilevich was issued his licence in Russia &ndash; but was later arrested on the political charge of &ldquo;cooperating with an undesirable organisation&rdquo;. In May, he was sentenced to 20 months in prison and ordered to pay civil damages roughly equivalent to &pound;1500.</p> <h2 class="p4">Is Pastafarianism a religion?</h2> <p class="p5">Wearing the colander can be interpreted as a protest against the legal exemptions and privileges readily granted to adherents of all the major world religions. The Dutch authorities, like the DVLA, would have permitted a turban, skull cap or nun&rsquo;s veil in ID photos as long as the face remained clear. De Wilde&rsquo;s case is the first and, so far, the only time that the European Court has considered whether Pastafarianism is a &ldquo;religion or belief&rdquo; worthy of protection in human rights law.</p> <p class="p3">The result of de Wilde&rsquo;s challenge, however, was the same in both Holland and Strasbourg: rejection. On the evidence, the Dutch courts found, and the European judges accepted, that she genuinely did wear a colander at all times when outside. (A black plastic colander which she likens to a &ldquo;bowler hat&rdquo; and wears at a rakish angle; she has a different one for cooking pasta.) But they could not accept that her beliefs constituted a &ldquo;religion&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">De Wilde argued that her beliefs were protected under Article 9 of the Convention on Human Rights, which states that, subject to various limitations:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p6">&ldquo;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">A regional court refused de Wilde&rsquo;s appeal on the grounds that wearing the colander was not mandatory in Pastafarianism. This argument was rejected on further appeal by the Administrative Jurisdiction of the Council of State, Holland&rsquo;s highest appeal court, because the case law of the ECtHR had previously held that the manifestation of a religion does not have to be mandatory to be protected.</p> <p class="p3">Instead, both the Administrative Court and the ECtHR rejected the claim that Pastafarianism could amount to a religion. Consequently, however much de Wilde wore her colander, it did not count as a religious act. The thorny path by which they reached this conclusion reveals the difficulties that arise when courts of law are asked to decide metaphysical questions.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;If you read an anthology on the concept of religion, you get hundreds of different definitions,&rdquo; says Paul Cliteur, Emeritus Professor of Jurisprudence at Leiden University. These go back to Cicero in the first century BC, who defined religion as &ldquo;reverence for the gods&rdquo;. It is unsurprising, Cliteur argues, that &ldquo;a bunch of judges assembled in the European Court&rdquo; should find it a tough nut to crack: &ldquo;they are not religious scholars, they are not philosophers, they are not involved.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p5">Through its case law, the ECtHR has developed a test for &ldquo;religion or belief&rdquo; under Article 9: to qualify, the relevant belief must have obtained &ldquo;a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance&rdquo;. In de Wilde&rsquo;s case, the judges quoted the reasoning of the Dutch Administrative Court, and then briefly reiterated it, to conclude that Pastafarianism failed to meet the requisite standards of &ldquo;seriousness and cohesion&rdquo;. The movement was designed to &ldquo;parody&rdquo; established religions in order to criticise the &ldquo;influence and privileged position afforded to [them] . . . in some contemporary societies&rdquo;; as such, it could not be a religion itself. Or, as the Dutch court put it, the &ldquo;satirical element&rdquo; was &ldquo;so dominant&rdquo; that the European Court&rsquo;s test could not be met.</p> <p class="p3">In the court&rsquo;s view, Pastafarianism was not serious; examples were drawn from Henderson&rsquo;s <em>Gospel</em>, including his &ldquo;Eight I&rsquo;d Really Rather You Didn&rsquo;ts&rdquo;, which parodied the Ten Commandments. Nor was it sufficiently cohesive; the court took as its example the pirates-and-global-warming theory. The court was equally dismissive of de Wilde&rsquo;s argument that her own &ldquo;individual version&rdquo; of Pastafarianism could be serious and cohesive, even if the movement as a whole was not; her explanations, it held, were too &ldquo;general and abstract&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">There is clearly force in the view that a humorous parody of something cannot itself be that thing. If the law is required to define concepts like &ldquo;religion or belief&rdquo;, then there must be limiting cases. Henderson&rsquo;s monster started as a sarcastic attack on the teaching of creationism. Its claims are outrageous and entirely unbelievable: that is the point. Wearing a colander or a pirate hat for an ID photo is ridiculous. The purpose of doing so is to question the idea that some forms of headgear are allowed, but not others, on the basis of unprovable dogma.</p> <h2 class="p4">Freedom of religion, or freedom of thought?</h2> <p class="p5">Yet there are difficulties with the courts&rsquo; reasoning if Pastafarianism is compared with other belief systems &ndash; and, like all parody, it is designed to be compared. Seriousness, for one, is not as straightforward a criterion as it appears. Take Mormonism, says Venema: it&rsquo;s &ldquo;hilarious&rdquo;. Indeed, to non-believers, the Book of Mormon reads like a parody of the Bible. If Pastafarianism is zany, it reflects the zaniness of established religions. As Henderson writes, &ldquo;every time an &lsquo;official&rsquo; ruling is made against our Church it illustrates how absurd the whole idea is of the state defining what is a legitimate religious organisation.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">The European Court&rsquo;s reasoning also betrays the extent to which, in judicial considerations of Article 9, the paradigm case is religion, and other beliefs are only extensions of that. The court concluded that Pastafarianism &ldquo;seeks the same privileges for itself [as for established religions] with a view to propagating its message.&rdquo; That is what it would do if it were a &ldquo;real&rdquo; religion, or a sham religion trying to gain money from its supporters. Yet De Wilde told me that she would be happy to remove the colander for her ID photo, as long as others did. &ldquo;We just want to be treated equally.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">There are many undercurrents in the Dutch courts&rsquo; resistance to Pastafarianism. One, argues Venema, is the civil servant&rsquo;s instinctive fear of mockery. &ldquo;We even discovered that there was a lot of communication by city administrations with the Ministry for the Interior. They were advised to deny all these applications by people who wore spaghetti strainers on their heads.&rdquo; As a result of this and the Dutch judgments, says de Wilde, the authorities have effectively discouraged any more Pastafarians from applying.</p> <p class="p3">A similar attitude was evinced by a Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois judge in another Pastafarian case in 2015. In the judge&rsquo;s view, the applicant, Isabelle Narayana, who wanted to wear a pirate hat in her ID photo, was treating &ldquo;in a banal manner the fundamental rights and liberties protected by the [Canadian human rights] charters, to the point of rendering them insignificant.&rdquo; He said her claim was &ldquo;an immense farce that aims to mock religions&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">Tanya Watkins, self-appointed Captain of the Church of the FSM in Australia, met with similar treatment when she applied to register it as a religious organisation. The judge, Kathleen McEvoy, considered that the scriptures of Pastafarianism were &ldquo;parodic texts, developed and expressed for the purpose of mocking and satirising established religions, holding them up to ridicule and suggesting they are worthless and meaningless&rdquo;. She even lambasted them for being &ldquo;racist&rdquo;, &ldquo;sexist&rdquo; and likely to be &ldquo;offensive or insulting&rdquo; to (real) religions.</p> <p class="p3">The implication of such judgments is that there is something nefarious about mocking religions in this way &ndash; perhaps due to a sense, in secular countries like Australia, the Netherlands and the UK, that protecting religious exceptionalism is a way of protecting minorities. Yet it is a sad state of affairs when the courts shrink from engaging with the question at the heart of the matter: whether the starting point in human rights law should be religion &ndash; cogent, serious and important &ndash; or whether it should be the freedom to think, believe or withhold belief, and act. If the latter (the secular starting-point), then there would be no need for courts to build a hierarchy of beliefs, or to stop Pastafarians from wearing colanders because they were not serious enough.</p> <p class="p5">For de Wilde, the point of fighting her case, and being deprived of a driving licence for five years in the process, is to achieve &ldquo;equality&rdquo;. In her view, Pastafarianism is &ldquo;not less real than other religions&rdquo;. Watkins agrees: &ldquo;it has all of the same elements any other religion has,&rdquo; and the same inconsistency in its followers&rsquo; interpretations.</p> <p class="p3">Depending on your perspective, Pastafarians are either the most undogmatic believers in history, or unbelievers who will go to extreme lengths to protest against religious exceptionalism. &ldquo;In a certain sense,&rdquo; says Cliteur, &ldquo;and I speak as an atheist, Pastafarianism is the ideal religion. If all humanity were Pastafarians &ndash; people with a sense of humour and a relaxed attitude towards their religious convictions &ndash; that would be a tremendous improvement.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Venema, despite his devotion to the Pastafarian cause, has not become an adherent. &ldquo;I have never considered joining any groups or organisations that are founded on a specific idea,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;As a philosopher, I want to be free to think and express anything I want . . . Which I could still do as a Pastafarian, of course.&rdquo; There you have it: a religion with no requirements, which is still too restrictive for a freethinking philosopher.</p> <p class="p3">Perhaps it is also a question of taste, and of the symbols people use to express themselves; colanders and cutlasses are not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. Not that Pastafarians are required to wear them.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. </em><em><a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="The Nine Ladies stone circle, Stanton Moor " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Nine_Ladies_stone_circle,_Stanton_Moor_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2360408.jpg" height="631" alt="The Nine Ladies of Stanton Moor" width="946" /></p> <p class="p1">Stanton Moor is situated in Derbyshire&rsquo;s beautiful Peak District National Park, in the heart of England. At first glance up here, it&rsquo;s all foxgloves, purple heather and wildflowers. But if you have an archaeologist&rsquo;s eye, like my friend Ian Jackson, you can detect something more deliberately patterned in the rocky formations that stretch out to the horizon in every direction: the outline of a Bronze Age roundhouse, sunken into the rock-strewn moor. The walls are long fallen and weathered away. Ian pointed out the narrow path that leads downwards and suddenly I saw it too. I stepped into the entrance and back through time. I was in someone&rsquo;s home.</p> <p class="p2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re closer to the Bronze Age people than they were to those who built Stonehenge,&rdquo; Ian observed. For a moment I was struck silent with the majesty of that timescale.</p> <p class="p2">I had come Bronze Age hunting because, like many people it seems, I have recently become fascinated with the pre-Roman peoples of the British Isle. My walk was partly prompted by the British Museum&rsquo;s blockbuster early summer exhibition on Stonehenge, the Neolithic stone circle in Wiltshire. Such stone circles pepper the length and breadth of this island nation. Not far from Stanton Moor is Arbor Low, another Neolithic stone circle at which the stones are now flat on the ground. Historians believe they were deliberately knocked down by medieval people, fuelled by their own superstitions.</p> <p class="p2">Stonehenge is a monument that Brits tend to think of as archetypically British. But the exhibition confounded all expectations. A wall mounted with dozens of beautiful stone axe heads from all over Europe revealed, post-Brexit, an almost provocatively counterintuitive picture; Britain connected by a large land bridge to northern Europe, with Stonehenge as the trading and pilgrimage heart of a borderless world. Recent excavations have provided plentiful evidence of trade from further afield &ndash; pottery, jewellery and weapons from the Middle East, North Africa and Asia Minor. More intriguing still were the mysterious carvings of flowing spirals and cups and rings, on giant rocks and boulders found across Europe, from Germany to Scotland.</p> <p class="p2">The British Museum show was fascinating &ndash; but there were some troubling aspects too. The exhibition included skeletons that had been unearthed in graves. One was the skeleton of a woman who was still clutching the outline of her dead baby, a bag of more than a hundred animal teeth buried with them as a spiritual offering. After more than a century of challenge, museums would not, I think, dare to display the human remains of ancient First Nation peoples this way. On the one hand, modern Europeans claim a kinship with these ancient brothers and sisters, and yet we tolerate what could be seen as the desecration of their graves. With their belief systems long lost, they have no one to advocate for them.</p> <p class="p2">And yet there is an honest spiritual craving in our modern behaviour around ancient monuments. Stonehenge is now understood to have been built in line with the natural cycle of the Earth&rsquo;s rotation around the Sun, aligning with sunrise during the solstices. Humanists surely recognise the pull of acknowledging our place in the beautiful but indifferent Solar System.</p> <p class="p4">Iwitnessed this pull in action on that day before the summer solstice when Ian and I walked on Stanton Moor. Not far from where Ian pointed out the outline of ancient homes is a Bronze Age stone circle known as the Nine Ladies. Around it, a tent city had grown up, of young families as much as old hippies, wanting to be part of something bigger than themselves. Such gatherings have been happening all over the country at stone circles.</p> <p class="p2">Part of it, I&rsquo;m sure, is that after all the Covid lockdowns, we are still cherishing our right to roam freely and be with others. But there seems to be something else we are craving. It may seem that we know very little about our ancient ancestors. We don&rsquo;t have a good idea of how they looked, and even their bones have mostly vanished. But they have left the most tantalising glimpses: jewellery made of black obsidian; gold torques of such weight and braided beauty it&rsquo;s dazzling to imagine them worn in ritual acts. It&rsquo;s also pleasing to discover that some of the finds in the Stonehenge exhibition suggest women may well have held positions of power in these societies, as shamans.</p> <p class="p2">These were humans living on a minute timescale compared to the weathered rocks of their monuments. Yet their mystery binds them to us. We are drawn to the idea of their transience &ndash; for what did the pandemic do more to reveal than the fragility of our own lives?</p> <p class="p2"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. </em><em><a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists.

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
