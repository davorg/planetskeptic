            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img title="HTLGI festival will return to the banks of the River Wye this May bank holiday" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/festival-grounds-with-festival-signsmall.jpeg" height="1181" alt="HTLGI festival will return to the banks of the River Wye this May" width="1774"></em></p> <p><em>HowTheLightGetsIn</em> has now firmly established itself as the most exciting philosophy festival in Europe. Bringing together ground-breaking thinkers from various fields of expertise and walks of life, there are usually intellectual surprises instore &ndash; if you're lucky, maybe even a revelation or two. Hilary Lawson, who calls himself a post-postmodern philosopher, founded HTLGI in 2008 in order to bring "philosophy into British culture". Since then, it has developed into a delight for the mind &ndash; while not neglecting the pleasures of the body (and, of course, delving into the boundaries between mind and body, and questioning whether such boundaries really exist.) There is music and comedy, as well as talks and panel debates. And a Ferris wheel, in case you feel the need to gain a completely different perspective.</p> <p>On 26-29 May, the last bank holiday of the month, the <a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/hay?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;utm_campaign=HTLGI+Hay+2023&amp;utm_id=Media+Partner">festival will return to Hay-on-Wye</a>. The historic book town is <em>just about </em>in Wales &ndash; it gets its name from the River Wye, which for much of its length forms the border between England and Wales. The town is charming, and hosts, at the same time, the Hay Literary Festival, so if you're feeling exceptionally avid, it's possible to do both.</p> <p>The festival has always dug into the big ideas. One of the many positive effects of bringing together scientists with politicians, activists, intellectuals and creative people of all stripes, is that the debates tend to push against boundaries. It's hard for an evolutionary biologist, for example, to get stuck on the particulars, when they're in conversation with a playwright or a moral philosopher. This year, however, they've made this natural tendency into an explicit theme, "Error and Renaissance".</p> <p>As Lawson put it <a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/arts-life/culture/music/957551/howthelightgetsin-london-philosophy-and-music-on-hampstead-heath">recently</a>, the purpose is to "come together to try and identify the fundamental errors that we have made in our theories, the organisation of society and in world affairs &ndash; all while looking to new forms of thought and action to rebuild afresh.&rdquo; Some of the big names already announced <a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/hay/programme?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;utm_campaign=HTLGI+Hay+2023&amp;utm_id=Media+Partner">in the programme</a> include philosopher Daniel Dennett, presidential advisor Fiona Hill, string-theorist Brian Greene and geneticist G&uuml;neş Taylor. Readers of <em>New Humanist</em> might also be interested in checking out Michael Shermer, who has spent his career popularising scepticism as a method to search for truth, or the prominent voice for Christian humanism, Nick Spencer. It's a chance to hear voices we both agree, and disagree with.</p> <p><em>New Humanist</em> is also sponsoring a debate, "The Best and Worst of All Possible Worlds", so if you do come to the festival, please stop and say hello. The panel will debate whether alternate worlds exist, and also whether the concept can be useful for thinking about <em>our</em> world, casting light on deep puzzles of language and reality. Philosopher of physics Paul Horwich, theoretical physicist Tasneem Zehra Husain and philosopher Ben Burgis will debate the continued attraction of many worlds theory, chaired by our Editor, Niki Seth-Smith.</p> <p>As a festival partner, we are offering a 20 per cent discount on tickets to all of our readers, with the code NEWHUMANIST23. Don't miss out on tickets <a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/hay/festival-passes?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;utm_campaign=HTLGI+Hay+2023&amp;utm_id=Media+Partner">here.</a> And for those of you who can't be with us in person, all the debates and talks from the festival will gradually be released online, on the Institute of Art and Ideas platform, <a href="https://iai.tv/?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;utm_campaign=HTLGI+Hay+2023&amp;utm_id=Media+Partner">IAI.TV.</a></p> <p>We hope to see you there!</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Eugen Sandow, founder of the Sandow system" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Sandow.jpg" height="768" alt="Eugen Sandow" width="1199"></p> <p>When the Irish &ldquo;physical culturalist&rdquo; F. A. Hornibrook wrote The Culture of the Abdomen in 1924, he was confident that he had conclusively identified the source of much of industrialised society&rsquo;s problems: chronic constipation.</p> <p>&ldquo;Between the trained athlete and the sedentary bookworm lies a great gulf across which age eventually throws a bridge where both meet in middle life, both burdened with enfeebled bodies, adipose deposits, pendulous bellies, constipated bowels and impaired mental activity... the ponderous speech of the portly magnate finds its echoes in the intestinal rumblings of his ponderous paunch, and awed ignorance acclaims wind for wisdom.&rdquo;</p> <p>Calling it &ldquo;the white man&rsquo;s burden&rdquo;, in chapters such as &ldquo;Sewage System of the Body&rdquo;, &ldquo;Buttock Contraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eating and Evacuation&rdquo;, Hornibrook advocated a series of measures to promote good stool cultivation, appreciation and, most importantly, expulsion.</p> <p>Some recommendations relate to diet &ndash; &ldquo;in paraffin, taken in tablespoonful doses three-quarters of an hour before a meal, we have a useful ally in the conflict with constipation&rdquo; &ndash; while others are to do with the vital moment of unburdening. Hornibrook argues that the modern water closet, in failing to replicate the squatting posture of &ldquo;the native&rdquo; (whose stools are &ldquo;soft, pultaceous and easily passed&rdquo; as opposed to civilised man&rsquo;s, which are &ldquo;almost as hard as old putty, and very dry&rdquo;), needs urgent adaptation to make it more conducive to stool delivery. Failing this, the individual can place a wooden platform eight inches high in front of the toilet, on which the feet can rest during the act of defecation, thus approximating the squat.</p> <p>Hornibrook &ndash; whose followers included H. G. Wells and Arnold Bennett &ndash; simultaneously promoted physical fitness based on native dancing rituals. The Culture of the Abdomen has helpful pictures of &ldquo;modern man&rdquo; and &ldquo;the native&rdquo; &ndash; the posture, attitude, dignity and buttocks of the former being compared unfavourably with the latter&rsquo;s. The book ends with a series of suggested exercises and aids to health including, somewhat randomly, golf. Remember, says Hornibrook, &ldquo;A short belt is a long life-line.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Battle of the Systems</h2> <p>Hornibrook&rsquo;s work grew out of what has become known to historians as the &ldquo;Battle of the Systems&rdquo;, a 19th-century clash between various types of physical regime for the promotion of wellbeing. With its roots in European military practices, and fuelled by an increasingly consumerist society both there and in the US, the various systems promoted different physical regimes, often combining them with dietary and &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo; advice. Between 1848 &ndash; that Year of Revolutions in Europe &ndash; through to the 1930s, newspapers and magazines promoted schemes for improving one&rsquo;s physical health.</p> <p>Beginning with the Turner movement &ndash; a gymnastic scheme imported to the US by Germans fleeing the 1848 revolution &ndash; the Battle of the Systems came to include the Czech Sokol movement (&ldquo;a strong mind in a sound body&rdquo;); the Swedish System, which concentrated on calisthenics, breathing and massage; and Muscular Christianity, which sought to combine spiritual and physical health as a bulwark against what many believed to be a decrease in manliness caused by excessive Puritanism.</p> <p>Promoted by sections of the Church, Muscular Christianity&rsquo;s version of Christ was the one that &ldquo;came not to send peace, but a sword&rdquo;. As one convert, Theodore Roosevelt, put it, in a truly Christian society &ldquo;there is only a very circumscribed sphere of usefulness for the timid good man.&rdquo; That many of these systems sprang from military training is no coincidence. Sokol argued that one should think deeply about Czech nationalism while lifting weights, while in the UK at the beginning of the 20th century, Muscular Christianity became part of the myth of how the British Empire was created and maintained. The true Brit had a Bible in one hand and a rifle in the other.</p> <p>But it was the Sandow system, named for its founder Eugen Sandow, and based on weightlifting, which had convinced Hornibrook of the benefits of physical fitness, having allowed him to reshape his body until he was known, in his own telling, as &ldquo;Brawnibrook&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Gym freaks</h2> <p>Sandow was born Jewish, the son of a German and a Russian. He began using weights at the age of ten. Briefly a circus strongman, he is credited with organising the world&rsquo;s first bodybuilding competition at London&rsquo;s Royal Albert Hall in 1901 (his fellow judge was Arthur Conan Doyle). At the turn of the century, Thomas Edison filmed him performing one of his &ldquo;muscle display performances&rdquo; and he was later designated special instructor in physical culture to King George V.</p> <p>As Natalia Mehlman Petrzela points out in her new book, Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America&rsquo;s Exercise Obsession (University of Chicago), despite the advocacy of F. A. Hornibrook and his like, when Sandow made his first tour of the United States, extreme physical health and exaggerated musculature were things to be ogled at, rather than aspired to. Audiences would gather to marvel at what were, in some senses, still freaks. Weightlifting and going to gymnasiums were not only niche activities, but were regarded with a certain amount of scorn.</p> <p>Fast forward a hundred years and Hornibrook and Sandow would be astonished at the centrality of many of their theories &ndash; if not their systems &ndash; in western public discourse. We find ourselves in a new Battle of the Systems, with a bewildering array of techniques supposedly aimed at making all of us fitter, happier and more productive.</p> <p>The global wellness economy was valued at US$4.4 trillion in 2020 &ndash; an astonishing 5.1 per cent of all global output. In the US, gyms are now a $40 billion industry. But despite the massive revenue generated, as Petrzela points out, fewer than 20 per cent of Americans actually work out consistently, a similar figure to the UK. In addition, over 73 per cent of Americans are classed as overweight, 42 per cent of them obese. According to a 2022 UK government report, three-quarters of the British population are overweight, and 28 per cent of them obese. The latter group includes one in seven children under the age of five. For all the talk of our fitness obsession, it seems as much honoured in the breach as in the observance.</p> <p>What one can discern, however, is how closely fitness and capitalism cleave together. If the Battle of the Systems grew from military training, it was no less a product of the Industrial Revolution. The working of the human body gradually became analogous to the working of the new machines which had begun to replace it. Initially, in the early 19th century, there was some upper-class distaste for both sweat and muscle. Both were seen as working class, and even in Sandow&rsquo;s day, part of the thrill of attending his performances lay in slumming it momentarily, and gawping at the bestial displays of these strange somatic creatures.</p> <h2>A moral debt</h2> <p>Increasingly, however, as the middle class emerged, the idea of both individual and societal productivity became more and more prevalent. Somewhere along the way, we developed the idea that to be unproductive is a sin. Physical fitness was no longer an end in itself &ndash; it became, and remains, a moral issue. As endless government campaigns and TV shows tell us, to be unfit is to be bad: a strain on the health service, a burden to society.</p> <p>Muscular Christianity is instructive here. Tracing its origins, somewhat spuriously, back to the apostle Paul, the movement argued that man &ndash; always &ldquo;man&rdquo; &ndash; had become too civilised, too effete and too intellectual. This was a moral failure as much as a physical one. In fact, one could not separate the two. Just as Hornibrook bemoaned the corpulent, flatulent &ldquo;magnate&rdquo;, proponents of Muscular Christianity argued that the degeneracy of the human body leads to moral degeneracy.</p> <p>As David Graeber argued in his 2011 book Debt: The First 5,000 Years, one of the reasons Christianity and capitalism work so well together is their shared belief that debt is fundamental and ultimately unresolvable. In Christianity we are born with sin and spend our lives trying to repay that debt. In capitalism we must keep earning to stop our financial debt growing. This moral imperative is analogous with the prevalent framing of fitness today as an endless and unresolvable quest: one can always be fitter, and not pursuing this goal is a failing to oneself and to society.</p> <p>To be fit is a personal responsibility &ndash; and therefore it is irresponsible not to be so. The underpinning idea of debt can be seen in the fact that public health campaigns are so often framed in financial terms. &ldquo;Obesity costs the taxpayer &ndash; those who earn enough to pay tax &ndash; x amount&rdquo; and so on, implying that the fit and rich are having to pay for the poor to sit around and get fat. In the UK, as the NHS collapses through chronic underfunding, the scourge of obesity is often held up as a drain on the public purse. Of course, one might argue that it is in fact a healthier middle and upper class, which lives longer, that causes the biggest drain, but this is seldom canvassed.</p> <h2>The temple of the body</h2> <p>The human body shaped by today&rsquo;s hyper-capitalist work regime may not be the only product of this kind of thinking. But if we were designing people who would best fit what capitalism wants, then a set of beings who run on coffee and are fitter than humans in the past would not be far off the mark. Perhaps the dramatic fall in alcohol consumption among younger people in recent years is the result of a partial internalisation of the moral requirement to be useful and productive. (As the French philosopher Georges Bataille noted in his 1949 book The Accursed Share, in a capitalist society, leisure, uselessness and luxury are increasingly only the domain of the upper classes, and are seen as sinful for working people.)</p> <p>As Petrzela notes: &ldquo;Fitness has become a socially acceptable form of conspicuous consumption in a society that celebrates the pursuit of health as practically holy.&rdquo; The body itself has thus become both corporatised and a devotional object &ndash; our temple.</p> <p>In addition, even more than in the Battle of the Systems, our current fitness obsession places the emphasis on individual empowerment at, Petrzela notes, the expense of collective solidarity. We are in a competition with others, but also with ourselves. It is part of a &ldquo;culture of narcissism&rdquo; which valorises an imagined freedom we can find &ndash; &ldquo;a lofty idiom of enlightenment&rdquo; where exercise is &ldquo;something more than bodily cultivation&rdquo;.</p> <p>This has led to some extreme outcomes. The Washington Post in 2022 ran a series of articles about deaths in the bodybuilding industry, caused by athletes pursuing ever more unnatural physiques. With steroids freely available, both male and female bodybuilders build themselves up to a point where, as one coach put it, the young Arnold Schwarzenegger would not even be able to compete, let alone win. It has led to a new form of body dysmorphia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM): &ldquo;bigorexia&rdquo;, where there is no such thing as big enough. &ldquo;Once you step into a gym, you&rsquo;re forever small&rdquo; sums up the thinking.</p> <p>Some individual empowerment is obviously positive. The relationship between feminism and fitness for instance is complex precisely because some of the gains in personal agency and self-esteem are so great that it is difficult to disentangle them from the negatives to do with, for instance, objectification. But a culture where the self is absolutely sovereign increasingly seems just another of capitalism&rsquo;s false versions of liberty. That &ldquo;the body beautiful&rdquo; has become such an aspiration conforms to an incredibly narrow definition of liberty. Like Eugen Sandow a century ago, we are suddenly all engaged in &ldquo;muscle display performances&rdquo;.</p> <h2>The business of the body</h2> <p>On an individual level, we all basically know how to be healthy, and have for a long time: eat plenty of fruit and veg, stay active, don&rsquo;t drink or smoke and get plenty of sleep. But the countless iterations of this story, emphasising new and different ways to approach the &ldquo;problem&rdquo;, force us to set up a plan &ndash; a corporate system of selfhood. We then micromanage as though our body were a business, which we have to run at maximum yield. Our fitness journals become individual profit and loss statements.</p> <p>However, as Fit Nation points out, despite the pursuit of individual health being seen as practically holy, it has not in fact become a &ldquo;public good&rdquo;. In the US, 80 per cent of the population live in what she terms &ldquo;fitness deserts&rdquo; &ndash; defined as &ldquo;an area without a public park in a half-mile radius&rdquo;. Additional factors such as higher pollution in deprived areas, as well as inadequate street lighting, also lead to a bias in favour of the wealthy when it comes to achieving the &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; that fitness vaunts.</p> <p>The pursuit of fitness requires both time and money. Witness the 2018 Mayo Clinic study which found that playing tennis could add 9.7 years to your lifespan. That those who play tennis tend to be older, richer and already healthier than the general population was not considered. Obesity rates in both the US and the UK are highest among people lacking time and money. Leaving aside the merits or demerits of fitness for a moment, what is notable here is that despite clear structural factors, this is still seen as a moral failing.</p> <p>For Petrzela, who is not only a professor of history but a fitness instructor, access to fitness is therefore a social justice issue. One cannot make fitness an issue of personal responsibility and then not enable equal access.</p> <p>&ldquo;It does not,&rdquo; Hornibrook wrote in 1924, &ldquo;add to the enjoyment of life to carry round superfluous flesh. It does not add to the enjoyment of life to have stuffed up bowels. It does not add to the enjoyment of life to have a sagging abdomen and atrophied muscles.&rdquo; No one can really argue with that. But nor does it add to the enjoyment of life to make the pursuit of physical health yet another moral quest, which is more often than not a moral failure and another unfulfilled debt.</p> <p>As Graeber put it, there is no better way to make things seem moral &ldquo;than by reframing them in the language of debt &ndash; above all, because it immediately makes it seem that it&rsquo;s the victim who&rsquo;s doing something wrong.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Jan McGee – the principal of Burns Science and Technology charter school in Oak Hill – claimed she spent months talking to a man online who was pretending to be the richest man on Earth, NBC affiliate WESH reports.</p>
<p>McGee was reportedly trying to net a multi-million dollar donation in the school, in exchange for a $100,000 check. Thankfully, the school’s business manager cancelled the check before it could be cashed.</p>
<p>The principal was repeatedly told she was speaking to a scammer, according to other administrators at the meeting. School staff members also pointed out other issues they have with McGee and accused her of fostering a toxic work environment.</p>
<p>McGee resigned after multiple staff members said they refused to work for her any longer, according to WESH.</p></blockquote>

<p>Humans are animals? Something must be done!</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>From a biblical worldview perspective, humans are different to animals.  Only human beings are made in the image of God. ““Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”&#8221; (Genesis 1:26).  </p>
<p>God made animals differently, “And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds”&#8221; (Genesis 1:24). When God created Adam, He brought animals to him to name to show there was no one like him, as none of the animals were made in God’s image, “But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him” (Genesis 2:20).</p>
<p>Because of the emphasis today that man is just an animal &#038; thus affecting people’s view of humanity &#038; how they view various moral issues, I suggest Christians use the criterion “made in the image of God,” for an additional Kingdom. This would place man in his own Kingdom, The Human Kingdom. We need our children to understand that humans are special &#038; made in God’s image, whereas animals are not made in God’s image.</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s gonna fix that. First step: redesign that zoo sign.</p>

<p>Humans are as different from all other organisms as paramecia are from sequoias, or elephants from mushrooms. The evidence for that is a) the Bible, and b) Ken Ham.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to have to demand a full phylogenetic analysis of that tree. I don&#8217;t think Answers in Genesis can do it. I don&#8217;t think they have the slightest conception of the rigor required of systematics.</p>

I had no idea he was Christian.</p></div>
<p class="lead">I am not at all surprised by the revelation that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kxpky/leaked-emails-reveal-an-anti-trans-holy-war">evangelical Christians think they&#8217;re waging a holy war against trans people</a>. Now we have even more evidence, in the email lobbyists write to politicians, with both incessantly claiming that God is on their side.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Under His wings,” one lobbyist wrote in an email. “The Devil never sleeps,” another person sent in an email chain about the distinction between gender and sex. “I pray for the 2nd coming more and more.”</p>
<p>These missives are part of a trove of leaked emails between South Dakota GOP Rep. Fred Deutsch, anti-trans lobbyists, and other state lawmakers about anti-trans policies that are filled with language so deeply religious that, at times, the communications read like scripts from The Handmaid’s Tale. It’s the language, one expert told VICE News, of Christian nationalists who believe they’re engaging in a holy war. </p></blockquote>
<p>The way these people talk to each other…it&#8217;s all Bible references and piety, while they&#8217;re advocating to increase the suffering of children. For someone like me, who is rather firmly anti-religious, it&#8217;s repulsive.</p>
<blockquote><p>The repeated notes about “blessings” and “prayers,” as well as sign-offs like “God bless you” and “Under His wings,” proliferate throughout the emails, which frequently reference explicit religious motivations for targeting trans people. </p>
<p>“Know that many have prayed and are praying for you this day. Do not back down, nor should you be afraid. Know that the Lord is with you. The children of South Dakota belong to him. He is jealous over them. Let his jealousies be spoken forth in the House of Representatives of South Dakota today so that his children would be made safe. Know you are HIS representative today. Do not be afraid. Stand firm in what is right,” wrote Vernadette Broyles, a lawyer and president of the Georgia-based Children and Parental Rights Campaign, which mobilizes against “gender ideology,” in 2020.</p></blockquote>
<p>They can&#8217;t muster a good argument or a rational defense for their behavior, so they resort to claiming Biblical authority. It&#8217;s lazy and stupid and done for an evil purpose, and damn the evidence. For the Bible tells me so (which it doesn&#8217;t, actually &#8212; most of this stuff is interpolation and reading their biases into the text) is all they&#8217;ve got.</p>
<blockquote><p>Emails from 2020 show right-wing lobbyists and politicians rejoicing after Idaho passed two anti-trans bills. One of the bills, which is still being fought by the ACLU, bans trans women and girls from girls’ sports, and is rooted in the myth that trans women have a leg up in sports, though evidence has consistently stated the opposite. “Dear Friends,” wrote Young, the Idaho representative, “I cannot thank you enough for your help and support! It is official—Governor Little signed both H500 and H509 today! Many tears and prayers of gratitude! The fight goes on!” Young sent the email to nearly 30 people, some of whom have also lobbied against abortion, including Deutsch.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the same story with the abortion holy war. It&#8217;s all based on emotional biases and ignorance, bolstered by a misreading of their holy book. I bet if we had a trove of email from anti-abortion lobbyists and politicians, it would be full of the same sickening god-talk.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also driven by paranoia and a persecution complex. They actually believe that trans people are an overwhelming powerful force bent on destroying a tiny band of Christian martyrs, so they need to eradicate them first.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Stopping the existence of transgender people and the acceptance of trans people in the public sphere is to them some sort of religious imperative,” Lecaque told VICE News.“It’s particularly fascinating that this group that has all this money, control in state legislatures, control of the house, they had a presidency, is acting like somehow they are David in the struggle.” </p>
<p>None of this is particularly surprising, and none of it is new. Today’s Christian nationalists believe that America is an inherently holy, Christian land, and that it’s their duty to restore God’s kingdom in order for Jesus to return. Part of this means that they think the country’s laws, policies and cultural institutions should reflect evangelical Christian values, VICE News previously reported. As a result, contentious cultural and political issues, like drag queen story hours and “critical race theory” are perceived as Satanic. Indeed, the Devil came up in the leaked emails.  </p>
<p>“I completely agree that it is Christian Nationalism, although I tend to refer to it as religious extremism,” Shupe said in an email to VICE News. “Christian Nationalists are a danger to the LGBTQ population, and society in general: a genuine threat to people&#8217;s lives and safety. They feign compassion while doing everything possible to strip us of our civil rights and ability to safely exist and participate in society.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes! Christianity is the poison in America&#8217;s veins. It&#8217;s everywhere. It is the Goliath that you find imbedded in every city, every small town, and every little farm across the country.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only cause for the prejudice, though. I have to wonder about the atheists who are happily siding with religious extremists to condemn the trans &#8216;agenda&#8217;.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="New York in the 1940s" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/GCS-New-York.jpg" height="679" alt="New York's Grand Central Station in the 1940s" width="694"></p> <p><strong>Still Pictures: On photography and memory </strong>(Granta) by Janet Malcolm</p> <p>In postwar New York, after escaping Nazi-occupied Prague in 1939, Janet Malcolm&rsquo;s mother Joan was having dinner in an American household. When time for seconds came, Joan declined. In bourgeois Prague, this was a charade known as nutcen&iacute;, and the host would insist until you relented. &ldquo;But here &lsquo;No, thank you&rsquo; was taken to mean just that, and the platter of delicious American food was whisked away before my mother&rsquo;s sad eyes,&rdquo; Malcolm writes.</p> <p>The anecdote captures a key theme of Malcolm&rsquo;s autobiography-of-sorts: the alienating experience of being an &eacute;migr&eacute; in a strange land, your personality changed, working out where you fit. Malcolm was four when she boarded one of the last civilian boats from Europe before the war. With the aid of photographs, diaries and letters she weaves an episodic story of her family in their new country: growing up in a Czech community in Manhattan, and the years preceding her career as an acclaimed author and journalist.</p> <p>Malcolm passed away in 2021 at the age of 86. Her last work is also her first of memoir, after a long career stretching the boundaries of nonfiction. Her book The Silent Woman, a biography of Sylvia Plath, called into question the entire voyeuristic project of biographies. In Forty-One False Starts, about the artist David Salle, she wrote in a disjointed form that merged with Salle&rsquo;s collage-like paintings. The Journalist and the Murderer has become a staple in journalism courses for its biting insights into fraught reporter-subject relationships. Whatever Malcolm wrote about, one obituary said, &ldquo;Her real subject was often the writing process itself.&rdquo;</p> <p>This book sees Malcolm&rsquo;s probing gaze pointed at her own life. She describes a classroom crush, who did not return her affections. &ldquo;I was part of the background of ordinary girls, who secretly loved and, unbeknownst to ourselves, were grateful for the safety of not being loved in return,&rdquo; she writes. She analyses what it means to appear a &ldquo;charming&rdquo; person, to flatter and show attention. &ldquo;When I ask someone a question &ndash; either in life or in work &ndash; I often don&rsquo;t listen to the answer. I am not really interested. (The use of a tape recorder during interviews permits me to counteract this obvious disqualification for my job.)&rdquo;</p> <p>The strongest sections question memoir itself. Our lives are &ldquo;like photographic negatives&rdquo;, she writes, but only a few are developed into photographs and become our memories. She resists this urge to narrativise life from what sticks out of the fog of time. Her father Joseph &ldquo;loved opera, birds, mushrooms, wildflowers, poetry, baseball... My mind is filled with lovely plotless memories of him.&rdquo; She warns autobiographers against using memories that seem to have a plot &ndash; &ldquo;conflict, resentment, blame, self-justification&rdquo;. These little flashes make us rethink the reading of all memoir.</p> <p>Malcolm&rsquo;s relationship to her mother forms the book&rsquo;s emotional core. She looks back &ldquo;ashamed and mortified&rdquo; at her distant young self, unable to give Joan the love she craved. Her mother would spiral into depression when Malcolm left letters unanswered or replied in glib jokes. &ldquo;How could I have been so cruel and callow?&rdquo; she reflects.</p> <p>Reading Still Pictures, I searched to pinpoint why the book feels so surprising. Some part is no doubt that, in 2010, Malcolm wrote of abandoning autobiography, arguing against its reliance on spotty memory. &ldquo;If an autobiography is to be even minimally readable,&rdquo; she wrote, the autobiographer &ldquo;must not be afraid to invent. Above all he must invent himself.&rdquo; As a journalist she found this repellent. Yet 13 years later, here the book is.</p> <p>Perhaps hardest to pin down is the question of motive. Malcolm flies past a variety of topics without landing on any definitely. It&rsquo;s hard to know who exactly the book is for. Those interested in memory&rsquo;s slipperiness? At times. Those who escaped persecution to begin life anew? For sections, yes. Fans seeking the person behind her journalism? If so, they&rsquo;re bound to be disappointed (she remains private, leaves too many mysteries unsolved; an affair is mentioned, unexplained, then quickly shuffled offstage). The collection seems to lack a coherence that, if Malcolm herself were reviewing it, she&rsquo;d no doubt spot.</p> <p>But this may have been her intention all along. Rather than circling around a central theme, like planets orbiting the sun, this engaging little book is more a series of flashing asteroids. And this is a more accurate description of how memory operates than the polished autobiographies in many bookstores. Yet again, Malcolm matches form to function. She gives us shooting stars &ndash; burning brightly in all directions before fizzing out before our eyes.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Start by imagining a billiard table with a ball travelling across it in a straight line" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/marcelo-leal-6UeBe2HqziA-unsplash.jpg" height="1229" alt="A billiards table" width="1920"></p> <p>For centuries, electricity and magnetism had everyone baffled. In the 19th century, Michael Faraday not only discovered new phenomena but summarised all that was already known in his three-volume Experimental Researches in Electricity. It enabled the great physicist James Clerk Maxwell to distill everything down to 20 equations in 1861-1862. A couple of decades later, this was reduced to four by the physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside.</p> <p>Maxwell&rsquo;s equations are considered to be the high-point of 19th-century physics. They contain the seeds of the revolutions that took place in the 20th century in the fields of both relativity and quantum theory. However, what Maxwell did not realise was that the bewildering array of electrical and magnetic phenomena he had summarised was no more than a consequence of one remarkably simple principle: &ldquo;local gauge invariance&rdquo;.</p> <p>Picture a billiard table and a billiard ball travelling across it in a straight line. Now imagine that the table is raised by a metre, or two metres, or by any height whatsoever. The ball will continue to follow the same trajectory. In physics, the height of the billiard table is an example of a &ldquo;gauge&rdquo; and the fact that it can be changed without altering the physics is a &ldquo;gauge symmetry&rdquo;.</p> <p>In 1918, the German mathematician Emmy Noether discovered that an unavoidable consequence of every such &ldquo;global&rdquo; symmetry is a &ldquo;conservation law&rdquo;. So, for instance, the fact that the outcome of an experiment will be the same if it is carried out today or tomorrow &ndash; that is, that it obeys &ldquo;time translational symmetry&rdquo; &ndash; leads to the &ldquo;conservation of energy&rdquo;, one of the cornerstones of physics, which dictates that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, merely transformed from one type to another.</p> <p>But it turns out that in a Universe in which the cosmic speed limit &ndash; set by Einstein &ndash; is the speed of light, it is impossible to lift all parts of a billiard table simultaneously. Imagine, for instance, the billiard table is ten light years across. The best that can be done is to raise one end and watch a hummock propagate across the table at the speed of light, reaching the far end ten years later. It would be reasonable to expect the laws of motion to remain the same everywhere in the billiard-table Universe and for the ball to continue following a straight-line path. However, this would be possible only if a force were introduced at every location to compensate for the undulation. This is the key thing: maintaining local gauge symmetry requires the existence of a force.</p> <p>In the 20th century, physicists discovered that a particle like an electron is described by a &ldquo;wave function&rdquo;, which propagates according to the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. The probability of finding the particle at any location is given by the square of the &ldquo;amplitude&rdquo; of the wave at that location. But, crucially, the probability does not depend on where the wave happens to be in its undulating pattern. This &ldquo;phase&rdquo; is the gauge, and changing it everywhere by the same amount merely moves the peaks and troughs of the wave along, but does not change anything observable.</p> <p>So what happens if we insist that not only global but local gauge symmetry is maintained &ndash; that is, that the probability is not changed by altering the phase of the electron wave function by a different amount at each location in space and time? Remember, from the billiard table example, that this requires the existence of a force. So, what is the force that is needed? Remarkably, it is precisely the electromagnetic force described by Maxwell.</p> <p>There are four fundamental forces that glue together the particles of matter and make the Universe possible. And, amazingly, three of those have been shown to exist only to maintain local gauge symmetry. In fact, 2023 marks 40 years since this was proved for nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;weak&rdquo; force, which is responsible for radioactivity. The proof was the discovery in 1983 of the particles that &ldquo;carry&rdquo; the weak force &ndash; the W and Z bosons &ndash; for which Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer won the Nobel Prize.</p> <p>In all the chaos of the world, it is easy to lose sight of how amazingly far we humans have come. We are a species of puny apes that arose on an African plain a mere blink of an eye ago in geological time. Yet we have discovered the genetic secret of life, made footprints in the Moon&rsquo;s Sea of Tranquility and discovered the principle that makes everything &ndash; the stars and galaxies and us &ndash; possible. Of course, we are left with the mystery of why nature is so obsessed by enforcing local gauge symmetry. What is the significance of the &ldquo;one rule that binds them all&rdquo;?</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="'How far are these books mere fantasies?'" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/petr-sidorov-GESOWH4YLRI-unsplash.jpg" height="1182" alt="Tarot cards" width="1773"></p> <p>I&rsquo;ve been spending these dark winter nights immersing myself in so-called &ldquo;witch lit&rdquo; &ndash; reading four of the many new books about witches published in the last year or so. My generation of 20-somethings enjoyed our fair share of feminist necromancy, with the TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer and hit films like The Craft coming out in the mid-90s. I wanted to know what the current trend for witchy novels and non-fiction revealed about the tastes and dreams of today&rsquo;s young women. How far are these books mere fantasies &ndash; wrapped up in social media-fuelled new age mumbo jumbo about tarot readings and manifestations &ndash; and how far are they grounded in genuine engagement with historical misogyny and patriarchal superstition?</p> <p>In a change from traditional Gothic imagery, I noticed that some of these books are packaged in bright candy-coloured covers; acid pink in the case of Weyward, Emilia Hart&rsquo;s much-heralded debut novel. Following three generations of English women in one family &ndash; in a 17th-century witch trial, the 1940s and the modern day &ndash; it does a good job of grappling with the idea that patriarchy and misogyny endure, even if they change their masks. But although I liked the idea of women having an animal affinity with the natural world of insects and reptiles, the novel has the fundamental problem of imagining witchcraft at some level, however benign, to be real.</p> <p>Kirsty Logan&rsquo;s Now She is Witch takes a more metaphysical approach, with echoes of the fantasy world of Game of Thrones or The Lord of the Rings, yet it is more satisfyingly realistic. Set in an impressionistic and non-specific Nordic mediaeval Europe, the heroine Lux navigates a theocratic Christian land of witch-burnings, exorcisms, controlling priests and superstitious warrior kings, where the only certainty is that women will be blamed for all wrongs.</p> <p>Logan&rsquo;s evocation of woman-hating perhaps draws on a growing popular knowledge of Scotland&rsquo;s disturbing record of witch-hunting in the 16th and 17th centuries, powered by King James I&rsquo;s (James VI of Scotland) obsession with them and his book Daemonologie. Scotland executed at least 2,500 people &ndash; overwhelmingly women &ndash; for alleged witchcraft. This was proportionally more than anywhere else in Europe and America. Scotland&rsquo;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made a formal apology for the murders in March last year.</p> <p>The King of Denmark and Norway even imported Scottish witchfinders &ndash; a fact I learned reading Anya Bergman&rsquo;s impressive historically researched novel The Witches of Vardo, about the torture and murder of women there in the 1662-3 witch trials. The book evokes the superstitious madness of that era, with peasant women from fishing villages on the wild coast blamed for conjuring up storms that downed ships with valuable cargoes. Bergman emphasises the persecution of the Sami native people of the region, incorporating their own legends and ideas of healing into a story that inspired me to find out more about the real events. And, controversially, she imagines a sympathetic interpretation of the role of a real female figure, Anna Rhodius, demonised in historical accounts for her part in the convictions.</p> <p>Against all this fiction, I also read a factual account of witch hunts that reads with the fluency of a novel. With all this interest in witch-lit, perhaps it&rsquo;s no coincidence that The Ruin of All Witches: Life and Death in the New World, published in 2021, came back onto the UK bestseller charts in January. Historian Malcolm Gaskill tells the full story of a 1651 witch hunt in Springfield, Connecticut &ndash; from first accusation to trial and verdict. This was 40 years before the Salem trials.</p> <p>Crucially, Gaskill writes to make us see the world as those early Puritans saw it; how their own psychological fears, of financial ruin, of neighbours, of Native Americans and the hostile elements, could seed the first accusations of witchcraft through how they interpreted their dreams: &ldquo;The minds of sleeping colonists were transported to a place where the wilderness met the invisible realm and received supernatural revelations encoded as symbols of civility and savagery: angels and serpents. Here the devil turned fantasy into fact and made witches of the weak.&rdquo;</p> <p>Gaskill&rsquo;s book cover is even in the same acid pink as Hart&rsquo;s Weyward. The latter, like the other novels I&rsquo;ve discussed, is fantasy. But, to their credit, all are rooted in this generation&rsquo;s advanced awareness of real-life patriarchy, and the desire of these young women to connect to the historical misogyny endured by their ancestors.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>
