            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Another way that AI is hurting us: it&#8217;s being used to generate science spam that is flooding YouTube. Kyle Hill points out that they&#8217;ve SEO&#8217;d their way to the top of video recommendations by, for instance, putting Elon Musk or Joe Rogan or Michio Kaku on the thumbnail (we&#8217;re already in dubious &#8220;science&#8221; territory), and then when you click on it you get this text-to-speech robotic voice reading what sounds like ChatGPT generated word salad accompanied by random images. It&#8217;s terrible stuff designed to trawl up bottom-of-the-barrel undiscriminating eyeballs.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t encountered much of this stuff myself, I think because I don&#8217;t click on the kind of videos he shows. It does highlight one of the many problems with the &#8216;algorithms&#8217; used by social media, because the spammers will always find a way to exploit the system.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/30/a-chiropractic-schism/">A chiropractic schism?</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">A chiropractor who also has a master&#8217;s degree in immunology is <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/vaccines-hearing-chiropractor-1.6839107">in trouble because she posted an op-ed that favored vaccines</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The article she posted by the New York Times was titled &#8220;Underselling the Vaccine&#8221; and described how experts were being overly cautious when reporting their success rate.</p>
<p>With a master&#8217;s degree in immunology, Weiss thought the article was interesting and wanted to pass it along to her many Facebook friends, which include immunologists and scientists, she told CBC News.</p>
<p>A fellow chiropractor — whose identity remains a secret to this day — saw it and reported her to the Manitoba Chiropractors Association, the regulatory body for her profession.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, some chiropractors believe in an evidence-based approach (then why are they still chiropractors, I wonder?) and others believe in subluxation, which is garbage pseudoscience.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the core of this divide in the profession is subluxation — a diagnosis used by some chiropractors to measure the health of someone&#8217;s spine.</p>
<p>If someone has a &#8220;subluxation-free spine,&#8221; there are some in the profession who believe that you don&#8217;t need vaccines or other medical interventions, explained Brian Gleberzon, a Toronto-based chiropractor and former professor at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would be a very traditional belief, and they would hearken back to the developers of the profession,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The subluxationists are out for Carolyn Weiss&#8217;s (the offending believer in vaccinations) blood, sending cease-and-desist letters and demanding the her op-eds be removed and threatening her license to practice chiropractic. They&#8217;re kind of nuts. They police what members say on the net.</p>
<blockquote><p>It led to the association subscribing to a web scraper tool in 2021 that crawls through the professional websites and social media accounts of chiropractors and flags keywords such as &#8220;vaccines.&#8221;</p>
<p>The word &#8220;evidence-based,&#8221; &#8220;principled,&#8221; &#8220;honest,&#8221; and &#8220;ethical&#8221; were also flagged, as the association felt they could be used to make one chiropractor appear superior to another, according to an undated memo from the association to chiropractors obtained by CBC News.</p></blockquote>
<p>The chiropractic association even has a rule that you can&#8217;t discuss vaccination because it is <q>not within the scope of chiropractic practice.</q> Well, yeah. But nothing medical is within the scope of chiropractic. I agree that chiropractors shouldn&#8217;t be dispensing any medical advice, any more than I should, but they are silencing this one thing for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/chiropractor-position-statement.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/chiropractor-position-statement-500x450.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="450" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70259" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/chiropractor-position-statement-500x450.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/chiropractor-position-statement-150x135.jpg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/chiropractor-position-statement-300x270.jpg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/chiropractor-position-statement.jpg 677w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never understood why people go to chiropractors &#8212; I suspect it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re cheaper than real physical therapy, they&#8217;re desperate for relief from chronic pain (and haven&#8217;t discovered opioid abuse yet), and chiropractors make wild promises. We have a <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/06/13/chiroquackery-in-morris-minnesota/">quack here in Morris who implied that his chiropractic shop would help cure cancer</a> &#8212; he seems to have adopted a lower profile since I highlighted his sleaze.</p>

<p>I went ahead and barreled right in, and even compared their defense of sexism to the revelations that emerged from the recent documentary, <i>Secrets of Hillsong</i>. The good ol&#8217; boy network is often deployed in the name of god, but sometimes it&#8217;s fired up in the name of science.</p>

<p>Transcript coming up!</p>
<p><span id="more-70249"></span></p>
<p>This weekend I watched a Netflix documentary, the Secrets of Hillsong, about the evangelical/pentecostal church that was founded in Australia. It was immensely popular for a time; Justin Bieber was a follower, they were influential in promoting a youth message for a conservative denomination of old fogies, the Assemblies of God. One of the reasons an awful lot of churches now have pop-rock bands in front of the congregation is Hillsong &#8212; it was a powerful tool for drawing in attendees, and was the rock upon which many megachurches were built. It grew from a regional Pentecostal church under Frank Houston, into an international network of megachurches under his son, Brian Houston.</p>
<p>The documentary begins with the story of Carl Lentz, a dynamic, charismatic preacher who trained at Hillsong, who led their first church in the United States in New York. While the new church grew phenomenally, it was also the beginning of the end. While it was a popular church among Black communities, it was noticed that very few Black people had prominent roles. It was the usual story: white leaders spoke a good game, talking up the importance of the Black community, while not following through.</p>
<p>The end of Lentz, though, was the discovery that he was burying stories of abuse in the church, and was cheating on his wife. Brian Houston denounced him and Lentz was dismissed.</p>
<p>Then it was revealed that Brian Houston had also been engaged in inappropriate behavior. It&#8217;s hypocrisy all the way through.</p>
<p>Brian Houston eventually resigned as evidence of two affairs was revealed, and even worse, his father Frank had been abusing children for at least 30 years, and Brian had known about it and covered it up. Frank was dead by then, so I guess he got away with it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the layers and layers of duplicity that were gradually unfolded that made the documentary interesting. These Christian characters were shown denying the accusations repeatedly, and then, eventually, admitting their truth: &#8220;I was having sex with that woman,&#8221; and &#8220;Oh, yeah, Dad was a pedo.&#8221;</p>
<p>The church has since imploded and splintered, with various branches cutting all ties, and attendance shrinking rapidly. It&#8217;s still around, but it&#8217;s influence is vastly diminished. It&#8217;s becoming a familiar story, with a similar collapse of Mars Hill, the Seattle-based megachurch. In that case, it was the arrogance and bullying of the lead pastor, Mark Driscoll, that led to its catastrophic collapse.</p>
<p>The lessons I learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Authoritarian leadership is bad. Humans are humans, and when given unconstrained power within an organization, they will abuse it.</li>
<li>
<p>Noble goals, even when I disagree with them, like the idea of bringing people to Christ, are never enough. You need rules and discipline for everyone &#8212; it&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve got a select few thinking they are above the rules that you get disaster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparency is essential. The unsavory secrets will eventually burn their way through whatever you&#8217;ve hidden them behind, and then there will be a reckoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone is an unreliable narrator when it comes to telling their own story. Cross-check everything.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not all I want to say, though. You know I already detest religion, especially Christianity, and especially evangelical Christianity. You could argue that what I&#8217;m saying here is also an example of unreliable narration &#8212; can you really trust my opinion when it comes to religion? You know I&#8217;ve got biases.</p>
<p>But then, right after I finished the Hillsong documentary, someone sent me a link to an article defending Geoff Marcy. It sounded very much like the apologetics offered by the perpetrators of the Hillsong debacle, but it has nothing at all to do with religion. It has to do with academia.</p>
<p>The article was a bit odd, coming out of the blue EIGHT YEARS after the Marcy affair was closed. The story is that Marcy was a prominent astronomer at Berkeley who was famed for his research on exoplanets. No one has questioned his research &#8212; it was great stuff, with many collaborators. But he was handsy with women. Multiple women came forward with stories of Marcy being inappropriately personal with them. Said one:</p>
<blockquote><p>“He’s had a long history of behaving inappropriately, especially with undergraduates,” said Kirkpatrick, who at the time was a graduate student at Berkeley studying astrophysics. “Women discouraged other women from working with him as a research advisor. It was just something that was talked about pretty frankly among the women in the department.”</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick, who has since left academia, continues to run the Women in Astronomy blog, through which she says three other women have approached her with accounts of their experiences with Marcy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The whisper network had identified him long before. Notice also that some women left the field because of his behavior. Said another:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the women, known as Complainant 3, studied astronomy as a graduate student. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because she did not want her involvement in the matter to affect her current job.</p>
<p>According to her account to Berkeley’s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination, she was at a post-colloquium dinner with her graduate department at the University of Hawaii when Marcy placed his hand on her leg, slid his hand up her thigh, and grabbed her crotch.</p>
<p>She didn’t register an official complaint until eight years later, by which time she’d left astronomy — in part, she said, because of the sexual harassment she and other female astronomers experienced. “When you’re a student and you see every complaint being ignored, and every male professor who has violated that have zero consequences, it really makes you not want to step forward,” she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Marcy abused his influence to shield himself from the consequences, and he was protected by other senior scientists.</p>
<blockquote><p>“What’s really infuriating about this is that anybody of my generation in the field of exoplanets knows that Geoff does this,” Johnson said. “Everybody is so afraid of doing anything about it that they are afraid of speaking out, but everybody knows it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>After investigations confirmed the problems with Marcy&#8217;s behavior, he eventually resigned. He was expelled from the National Academy of Science. He still publishes papers, and still raises controversy. The latest is that he was co-author on a paper that excluded credit to the graduate students who did much of the work.</p>
<p>Here is that paper, on which he is third author. It&#8217;s been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Notice the comment at the end, from the lead author: &#8220;It has come to my attention that there are significant concerns about the author list of this manuscript. It is very important to me that I honor everyone&#8217;s contribution to this work appropriately. Accordingly, I am revisiting the author list, with the goal of setting a standard for authorship that fairly acknowledges everyone&#8217;s contribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an authorship dispute. The grad students felt unfairly overlooked, so the author list is being reviewed. Seems reasonable. However, this has sparked unwarranted anger on the right. Here&#8217;s the headline for the complaint:</p>
<p>Campus Puritans Come for an Astronomer—And His Byline<br />
By demanding that morality tests be imposed on scientific journal authorship, Geoff Marcy’s critics are creating a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>Let me put this in context, though. This article was published in Quillette, the online journal that specializes in publishing slanted articles from aggrieved conservatives, race pseudoscientists, and people who are outraged at the existence of gay and trans people. The joke is that if you want to publish your positive views on craniometry and phrenology, it will be beloved on Quillette. It is not a reputable site, quite the opposite actually. The choice of venue instantly calls into question the content of the article.</p>
<p>Also, note the author, Lawrence Krauss. Krauss faced his own scandals, accused of behaviors that &#8220;range from offensive comments to groping and non-consensual sexual advances.&#8221; He was notorious for defending Jeffrey Epstein, a precedent that ought to make Geoffrey Marcy uneasy about being defended by him. His position as the head of the Origins project at Arizona State University was not renewed, because ASU agreed that the preponderance of evidence showed that he had violated their policies against sexual harassment. However, he did not get fired from his job; instead, he waited a year and quietly resigned.</p>
<p>So basically what we&#8217;ve got here is a harasser trying to defend a harasser on the pages of a disreputable racist website. Yeah, I think we can dismiss this one out of hand.</p>
<p>I will comment on one thing, though, this idea of demanding morality tests on authorship. From what I&#8217;ve read, that isn&#8217;t a question here: some graduate students are unhappy that their names were left off the paper, while the notorious harasser was left on.  It&#8217;s a complicated question of what we&#8217;re going to value.</p>
<p>But also, why shouldn&#8217;t we consider moral values in this sort of thing? Why should known offenders be allowed to gather fame and reputation from scientific research, especially when it&#8217;s at the expense of students? Both Marcy and Krauss have been cast aside by the scientific community as unworthy contributors, so what advantage is there to welcoming them to the pages of our journals? Another point that their coauthors ought to bring up: they&#8217;re being asked to share a byline with someone who is a known predator. They have the right to object to the association.</p>
<p>It is right and necessary that people who abuse the system should not be allowed to profit from it.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Hillsong. They too built a hierarchy with flawed people at the top; they wanted to hide away the abuse; they tried to silence critics; they considered their authorities too important to question. And look where it got them! It led to them being so thoroughly discredited that their organization crumbled beneath them. Near the end of the Hillsong documentary they talked with some of the featured workers in the group, and it was impressive how well they had been alienated. Some were still religious, but switched denominations. Some of them rebuked the megachurch experience and had found belonging in small community churches. Some had lost their faith. One even declared that he was now a happy atheist.</p>
<p>Science, at least, is not reliant on a single hierarchical authority so it&#8217;s not going to collapse as suddenly as a church. Still, though, keep in mind that Geoffrey Marcy was driving women out of astronomy. This is an incalcuable loss. I don&#8217;t care how great Marcy&#8217;s research was &#8212; that information is still there &#8212; but we cannot continue to prop up researchers who are harming the discipline as a whole. Exoplanet science is not dependent on any one person and will continue to progress, probably even at a faster rate as the selfish disruptors are weeded out.</p>
<p>None of this is about &#8220;puritans&#8221; or even &#8220;pathetic, posturing little wimps&#8221;. It&#8217;s not even about sex at all. It&#8217;s about checking an abuse of power. If you&#8217;re concerned about the detriment to science that losing Geoff Marcy has had, think about this: what if, early in his career, one of his peers had taken Marcy aside and explained that his behavior was troubling, that people see what he&#8217;s doing, and he should stop it. Maybe then he wouldn&#8217;t have gone on to damage himself and the careers of the women he worked with, he wouldn&#8217;t have lost his job, and we&#8217;d all be in a better place.</p>
<p>As long as there are people like Dawkins and Krauss who make excuses for predators and accuse anyone who protests abuses of power, though, the problem will persist and grow. I&#8217;m sure we can all think of other examples of this unfortunately human phenomenon.</p>

The soldiers were wholly unprepared, with no masks to protect them.</p> <p>Not wanting to be caught offguard again, the Allies dispatched a chemist to the battlefield, to shed light on this devestating new weapon. Of course, by the time John Scott Haldane and his team arrived the gas had long since dispersed. But subtle clues were left. They noticed a discolouration of the brass buttons on the unfortunate soldiers&rsquo; uniforms. Something had reacted with the zinc and copper in the brass, and the culprit was chlorine.</p> <p>Over 100 years later, inspectors at sites of chemical weapon attacks face a similar problem. The chemical agents are reactive, volatile and frequently work at very low concentrations, all of which make them difficult to detect. Often autopsies are used, but this can be complicated as human remains need careful and considerate collection and transportation.</p> <p>Plants, however, are much easier to work with. This approach has been recently pioneered by a group from TNO Defence in the Netherlands. They exposed plants to mustard gas, sarin (a nerve agent deployed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2013), chlorine and Novichok (used in the 2018 Salisbury attacks). Vegetation survives the exposure, but is not totally unaffected. Each of these agents reacts with proteins within the plants. These modified proteins can be easily extracted and detected using highly sensitive mass spectrometry.</p> <p>The method was tested on basil, stinging nettles and bay laurels, suggesting the approach will likely work for a wide variety of species. The only issue was that exposure to common household bleach generated the same response as chlorine gas. Meaning, in the absence of brass buttons, there is more work to be done to rule out this source of false positives.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the methodology shows strong promise and now just requires some samples from real-world incidents to validate the approach. Let&rsquo;s hope TNO Defence don&rsquo;t get these samples any time soon.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="'An Old Woman', or 'The Ugly Duchess', by Quinten Massys. Copyright: The National Gallery" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Ugly-Duchess-cropped-resized.jpg" height="1008" alt="'An Old Woman' - commonly known as 'The Ugly Duchess' - by Quinten Massys. The portrait depicts an old woman with exaggerated features, including a bulging forehead and bosom squeezed into an ill-fitting corset" width="750"></p> <p>It is said that the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis died while laughing at his completed likeness of an ugly old woman. The Flemish artist Quinten Massys survived the painting of &ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&rdquo; (about 1513), but it might have been a close shave. Certainly plenty of people have at least smirked at her in the years since.</p> <p>This is because, and there is no getting around it, she appears ridiculous: bulging forehead, protruding ears, puckered mouth, hairy mole on her cheek, huge horned headdress and shrivelled bosom. She looks beseechingly upwards, clutching a tiny withered rosebud. When the painting was put up for auction in 1920, the <em>New York Times</em> advertised the sale of a &ldquo;portrait which is generally accepted as being the ugliest one in the world&rdquo;. But why is she ugly? And how are we meant to respond?</p> <p>A new exhibition at the National Gallery in London called &ldquo;The Ugly Duchess: Beauty and Satire in the Renaissance&rdquo; successfully answers these questions. It traces the influences on and atmosphere around the conception of &ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&rdquo; &ndash; religious, artistic, misogynistic &ndash; and convincingly places her within a long tradition of negative portrayals of women. There are witches, crones and hags; the incredible grotesques of Leonardo da Vinci; and the creepy John Tenniel illustrations for the 1865 edition of Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. All either influences on, or influenced by, Massys&rsquo; duchess. It is to the considerable credit of this exhibition that it hasn&rsquo;t dampened the fun of these artworks, while brilliantly elucidating the sinister threads that run through them.</p> <p>The first thing that we discover is that the duchess has a partner. A man. Apparently, they were conceived as a pair, then separated and lost to each other for many years. Reunited, they make an odd couple. For one thing he looks remarkably unremarkable, even dull. He is seen in profile wearing a dark velvet cap and dark fur-trimmed coat. He looks prosperous and respectable. He has full lips, heavy lids and a bland expression, with one hand held up towards the duchess. Plainly, an exchange is taking place: his outstretched hand is a response to her proffered rosebud.</p> <p>The exhibition makes clear that this was a familiar trope. The accompanying catalogue informs us that &ldquo;The advent of print culture in the second half of the fifteenth century expanded the repertoire of secular imagery and propelled humorous subjects deriding what were then considered society&rsquo;s ills.&rdquo; One such target of satire was the so-called &ldquo;ill-matched couple&rdquo; &ndash; usually a wrinkled woman or wizened man who is courted by a much younger partner desirous of their wealth. A brilliant example of this genre is provided in the form of an engraving by Israhel van Meckenem called &ldquo;The Unequal Couple&rdquo; (about 1480&ndash;90). A corpse-like woman looks deep into the eyes of a beautiful young man with flowing locks, while his hand travels over the large bag of coins she is clutching.</p> <p><img title="&quot;Alice and the Duchess&quot; (1865) by John Tenniel. Copyright: V&amp;A" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/FF8747.jpg" height="771" width="500"></p> <p>Our couple exhibit more dignified behaviour, yet they too would have been immediately identified as ridiculous. The man (possibly based on the vastly wealthy Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici) is cast as a recognisably smug banker-merchant type, while the woman (rumoured to have been based on the famously ugly Margaret, Countess of Tyrol) is cast as a recognisably freakish grotesque &ndash; a stock character borrowed from Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s <em>visi mostruosi</em> (monstrous faces). Her likeness appears again and again in different works by different artists &ndash; in Florentine engravings, English misericords and French illustrations. In each she is a figure of either fear or fun.</p> <p>One cause for ridicule is her outfit. The outsized headdress and revealing corset, in what was then an outdated and vulgar style, would have immediately marked her out as the &ldquo;embodiment of foolish vanity&rdquo;. The great philosopher Desiderius Erasmus (Massys&rsquo; contemporary and patron) had especial contempt for such overdressed women: &ldquo;Who would put up now with a decent married woman wearing those huge horns and pyramids and cones sticking out from the top of the head and having her brows and temples plucked so that nearly half her head is bald?&rdquo; On seeing such a figure &ldquo;Everyone would laugh and boo.&rdquo; Clearly, in the 16th century, such a get-up was familiar visual comedy: the delusional old woman, full of lust and avarice, mutton dressed as lamb.</p> <p>But amid all the laughing and booing there is also a palpable unease. This is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the exhibition. Old women, their representation made more visceral by the period&rsquo;s furtherance of verisimilitude, are here often depicted as sagging, cackling hags. Due to religious and folkloric superstitions and misunderstandings over how the female body works, there had developed a pervasive fear of women &ndash; in particular, fear of their sexuality. <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> (or <em>The Hammer of Witches</em>, first published in 1486), a treatise written by German Catholic clergyman Heinrich Kramer, declared that &ldquo;all witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which is in women insatiable&rdquo;.</p> <p>This concern can be seen in Massys&rsquo; sly-looking, overdressed hags (those horned headdresses are a sure sign of devil worship), but it finds its battiest representation in the wonderful engraving &ldquo;Morris Dance with the Sausage Woman&rdquo; by the Italian Monogrammist SE. Here, we behold a woman much like the duchess who holds in one hand a spear of phallic sausages and in the other a satanic cloven hoof, while a group of men dance around her.</p> <p>In this image, and elsewhere, older women are depicted as worryingly powerful &ndash; as enchantresses, seducers and subverters of men&rsquo;s rightful position. The most exhilarating example featured in the exhibition is Albrecht D&uuml;rer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat&rdquo; (about 1500). An old, half-undressed woman with sagging breasts and an expression suggesting a full-throated war cry soars across the page on the back of a black, horned goat, scattering four cherubim in her wake. Her hair eerily flows in the opposite direction she is travelling and she suggestively grips the goat&rsquo;s horn. In this disconcerting image of disorder and rebellion there is little for the male viewer to chuckle at.</p> <p><em>In The Witch as Muse: Art, Gender and Power in Early Modern Europe</em>, Linda Hults observes that &ldquo;The sexual drive was believed to be greater in postmenopausal, widowed women. Their sexuality was especially repugnant not only because of their physical appearance but also because it could not lead to procreation.&rdquo;</p> <p>It is interesting that Massys&rsquo; &ldquo;ugliest&rdquo; portrait should have an afterlife as the frightening duchess in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> (beater of babies and owner of the Cheshire Cat). While not mentioned in the exhibition, the portrait also bears a resemblance to the witch in the Studio Ghibli film <em>Spirited Away</em>. She becomes, in these new guises, divorced from the real-life fears and prejudices that shaped her in the first place. She is just a scary template. What is affecting about the items collected at the National Gallery is that they remind us of the uncomfortable themes beneath. In their laughter, sadness or fury, the paintings reflect something in the viewer. Perhaps a guilty conscience.</p> <p>The exhibition holds out the promise of discovering a duchess who is not only grotesque, but also &ldquo;subversive, fierce and defiant&rdquo;. While the curators have gamely tried to reposition her as a more actively destabilising presence, this is ultimately unconvincing. Like it or not, the joke is entirely at her expense. &ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&rdquo; was conceived and executed amid titters, for an audience that was looking for a laugh. Although now, in this concise but wide-ranging exhibition, she might finally be in more sympathetic company.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/The_Beatles_performing_at_The_Ed_Sullivan_Show.jpg" height="641" alt="The Beatles performing on The Ed Sullivan Show" width="921"></p> <p>In my favourite scene from their animated film <em>Yellow Submarine</em>, the cartoon Beatles see a submarine, identical to theirs, going in the opposite direction. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone in it. Look!&rdquo; one remarks. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re waving,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a group of fellas.&rdquo; They wave back, realising that it&rsquo;s themselves, going backwards in time.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve thought often about how strange it must feel, being Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr, seeing their years as the Beatles &ndash; one phase of their long lives &ndash; take on a perpetual existence. And, quite unexpectedly, I&rsquo;ve found myself contributing to that spinning media whirl.</p> <p>In late March, I learned of the existence of an almost complete concert recording of the band made by a 15-year-old student at Stowe boarding school. A few days later, I broadcast the news on my BBC Radio programme Front Row. I had gone to Stowe with the former student, John Bloomfield, to make a special programme about the 60th anniversary of the concert. I had no idea about the tape until Bloomfield, now 75, revealed its existence to me. Listening to the concert transported me back to 4 April 1963, a particular moment in time when a group of privately educated boys saw the future in their encounter with a quartet of working-class boys from Liverpool.</p> <p>Bloomfield had clearly decided now was the time to uncover the &ldquo;lost tape&rdquo;, and I was touched by his trust in me. I alerted Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn and arranged for us to listen to it in full together. Lewisohn told me the tape was genuinely important, for capturing the band in full, at a unique moment and before their gigs became entirely blanketed in screams.</p> <p>Certainly, when Bloomfield played some of the recorded songs from the original school theatre stage, through the modern speakers, I experienced something akin to a transformative moment: a realisation of how mind-blowing the juddering, bone-shaking intensity of their live performance must have been.</p> <p>As time transports us further away from the &rsquo;60s and the Beatles, there is a sense of a growing reverence. Little snippets of film footage or old photographs emerge regularly like religious relics to be gawped at in the news and, as in medieval times, bought up by rich collectors for their private reliquaries. I had no intention of contributing to this trend. My story was really about the social history of that moment &ndash; the unique collision of class and culture that took place during that concert, with its almost entirely male audience.</p> <p>There is a massive mythology that has built up around such moments in the Beatles&rsquo; career, but I think there&rsquo;s a lovely secular power in the fact that the gig has been captured on tape.</p> <p>We have the vision of a sixth-former to thank, who had seen the band perform in the Cavern nightclub and approached the manager. This bold student, Dave Moores (who would go on to become the chairman of Liverpool FC), organised the concert himself, selling tickets at 5 shillings to cover the &pound;100 fee, without involving any schoolmasters. Bloomfield was stage manager and decided to run a tape with a microphone at the front of the stage.</p> <p>There is no denying the intense religious devotion that the band evoke in some fans. Within hours of breaking the story I had messages from several countries, some polite, but most with an edge of urgency, desperately keen to know what was on the set list.</p> <p>One astute reader queried anxiously about whether a photograph of the band at Stowe that night, used to illustrate a newspaper story about my find, had been flipped or mirrored &ndash; they were concerned that Paul and Ringo were holding pens in their wrong hands (Paul and Ringo are left-handed, although Ringo might have signed with his right).</p> <p>New threads to the story have emerged since then, through the people contacting me. One of the very few girls at the gig, a daughter of the couple who ran the tuck shop, got in touch on hearing my report. I connected her to Bloomfield, a boy she&rsquo;d not spoken to for 60 years.</p> <p>In <em>Yellow Submarine</em>, the old sea captain warns the band, &ldquo;If we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we&rsquo;ll all disappear up our own existence.&rdquo; But there is nothing introspective about this story. I was delighted to hear that Bloomfield plans to donate the tape to a public cultural institution. Far from adding to a private reliquary, it looks like the Stowe tape will continue to open up joyful stories for the future.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

The DUNE project will investigate the neutrino &ndash; the tiniest of fundamental particles, meaning &ldquo;the little neutral one&rdquo; in Italian. It is being constructed one mile deep below Sanford Lab in South Dakota.</p> <p>Neutrinos are so tiny that they barely interact with anything and simply glide straight through you, through the Earth and out the other side. But these particles have a mighty role to play in helping us understand some of the most fundamental questions in physics: What is the origin of matter and why is there an imbalance of matter and anti-matter? Is there a grand unifying theory that connects all forces? How do black holes form?</p> <p>More than 1,000 scientists and engineers, from 200 labs and universities across 30 countries, are collaborating to build DUNE in the hope it will reveal key information about this mysterious particle. The DUNE experiment starts with an underground particle accelerator, where particles will smash into a target to generate an intense beam of neutrinos that will travel through the ground towards the detectors. That&rsquo;s the easy part. The real challenge is in the design and construction of huge, highly complex detector systems that are capable of seeing a particle that doesn&rsquo;t want to be seen.</p> <p>Each of four detector modules will be a liquid-argon chamber filled with 17,000 tons of argon. Neutrinos colliding with argon atoms will produce charged particles that in turn knock out electrons that will be detected by 150 2.3m x 6m units of tightly-wound copper beryllium wires, thus providing a signal that can be recorded as neutrino data. And now the DUNE collaboration has announced the exciting news that mass production for this first, colossal detector module has started, after a series of successful prototype tests at CERN.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks to Podimo and TellTale studios for supporting and producing the podcast.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
