<p class="lead">My daughter, Skatje, is doing her PhD defense on Thursday, and Mary and I will be attending over Zoom. Naturally, not wanting to look like a dope, I thought I&#8217;d look up <a href="http://ska.tjemye.rs/">her work</a> (finally) and get a little hint of what I&#8217;m going to hear. I&#8217;m already lost.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hallo, I&#8217;m Skatje Myers, a PhD student in Computer Science (joint degree in Cognitive Science) at the University of Colorado at Boulder, advised by Martha Palmer.</p>
<p>My research focus is in accelerating development of new corpora for semantic role labels (SRL).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m investigating techniques for conducting active learning for semantic role labeling: How can we determine which sentences will most improve the model when annotated and added to our training data? This methodology enables us to improve annotation efficiency by selecting only the most informative sentences to annotate.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&#8217;m examining approaches for projecting semantic annotation cross-lingually: If we know what the semantic roles are in an English sentence, and we know the translation of that sentence, can we figure out which words to assign those roles to in the target language? These projected annotations may serve either as a starting point for manual annotation that will expedite the process, or as training data themselves.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m presently exploring these techniques specifically in regards to developing and expanding a Russian PropBank corpus.</p></blockquote>

<p class="lead">I&#8217;ve been poisoned with unwanted images of <a href="https://eddsa.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/public/650033_2023_Noelle_Dunphy_v_Rudolph_W_Giuliani_et_al_COMPLAINT_10.pdf">a corrupt 70-year-old Republican hopped up on Viagra</a> demanding that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/giuliani-demanded-staffer-oral-sex-during-calls-from-trump-lawsuit-2023-5?amp">a young woman service him</a>, over and over.</p>
<blockquote><p>Giuliani also took Viagra constantly. While working with Ms. Dunphy, Giuliani<br />
would look to Ms. Dunphy, point to his erect penis, and tell her that he could not do any work until<br />
“you take care of this.” Thus, Ms. Dunphy worked under the constant threat that Giuliani might<br />
demand sex from her at any moment. Even when the Covid-19 pandemic halted Giuliani’s ability<br />
to physically assault her, he demanded that she disrobe during their work-related<br />
videoconferences. </p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s gross and disgusting and vile, but exactly what I should have expected of Giuliani.</p>
<blockquote><p>A bombshell lawsuit out of Manhattan accuses Rudy Giuliani of forcing a former employee to submit to sex acts as a condition of her employment — including making her give him oral sex while he took calls from then-President Donald Trump on speaker phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;He often demanded oral sex while he took phone calls on speaker phone from high-profile friends and clients, including then-President Trump,&#8221; ex-staffer Noelle Dunphy claims in the 70-page lawsuit filed Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Giuliani told Ms. Dunphy that he enjoyed engaging in this conduct while on the telephone because it made him &#8216;feel like Bill Clinton,'&#8221; according to the lawsuit, which seeks $10 million in unpaid wages and damages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like the worst of Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to hear more about the sex stuff, but I do want the law to dig deeper into the money stuff.</p>
<blockquote><p>The lawsuit also alleges — buried on page 25 — that Giuliani asked Dunphy for help &#8220;selling pardons&#8221; for $2 million a pop. Giuliani told her that he and Trump &#8220;would split&#8221; the fee, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>&#8220;He also asked Ms. Dunphy is she knew anyone in need of a pardon, telling her that he was selling pardons for $2 million, which he and President Trump would split,&#8221; the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>Dunphy said she continued to work for Giuliani despite being &#8220;shocked and saddened by what had happened&#8221; because she feared losing the $1 million salary he had promised as well as free legal representation he had also agreed to give her. </p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how you can sit here thinking the crap from the Trump administration couldn&#8217;t possibly get worse, and then <em>it does</em>.</p>

As some states moved to criminalise abortion, there was outcry against the idea of pregnant women being treated as criminals for exerting agency over their own bodies. But, as a new report from researchers at the World Health Organization (WHO) makes clear, criminalisation of abortion is the norm, not the exception, globally. Of the 182 countries for which there was data as of October 2022, abortion was completely decriminalised in just one: Canada. Penalties range from fines to, in a handful of countries, life imprisonment. </p> <p>In the UK there is a widespread belief that abortion is not a crime. In England, Scotland and Wales, the procedure is legal if authorised by two doctors before 24 weeks&rsquo; gestation, or in cases where there are serious health risks to continuing the pregnancy. But it remains criminalised outside these parameters under legislation passed in 1861.</p> <p>Last year, at least two women were charged with abortion-related offences in England, both for allegedly taking abortion pills after the 24-week limit. One of the cases was dropped after prosecutors agreed it was not in the public interest to pursue it; the other woman pled guilty to unlawfully administering a poison or noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage, an offence under the 1861 law, and is awaiting sentencing. This year, already, at least two more people have been charged. </p> <p>Dozens of women have also been investigated over the past decade, according to a recent report in the <em>Observer</em>. Some were arrested in their hospital beds; at least one was jailed. A girl as young as 15 had her phone and laptop confiscated, for investigation, during her GCSE exams. Police produced text exchanges with her boyfriend, where she expressed doubt over having the baby, as evidence against her, before a coroner concluded that the pregnancy had ended due to natural causes. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Northern Ireland maintained a near-total ban on abortions until 2020, when Westminster took advantage of the collapse of Stormont&rsquo;s power-sharing deal to intervene. There are still 11 countries &ndash; including Andorra and Malta &ndash; where abortion is prohibited in all circumstances.</p> <p>The great irony of these laws is that they don&rsquo;t reduce abortions. A study in 2020 from researchers at the Guttmacher Institute and WHO found that the abortion rate was the same in countries where it was &ldquo;broadly legal&rdquo; as in those where it was completely banned. Meanwhile, even partial criminalisation can be dangerous, because it can discourage or delay women from seeking safe abortions and cause health workers to be overly cautious, even to the point of denying legal forms of care.</p> <p>The evidence is clear: criminalisation only serves to limit safe and regulated abortions, while putting women and girls at risk.</p> <p><em>This is a preview from New Humanist's summer 2023 issue. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>This has been around for a while. Several years ago, a student at our local high school talked up vegetarianism &#8212; I think he even got an op-ed in the local paper &#8212; and almost immediately the Cattlemen&#8217;s Association showed up at the school to give away free steak sandwiches. I think they&#8217;re running scared.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve mostly* given up on red meat for a number of reasons, but one of them is that the meat industry is incredibly wasteful and damaging to the environment. It&#8217;s very sad that the Lettuce Industry or Bean Corp. isn&#8217;t knocking on my door offering big bucks to chat up their delicious vegetarian items. Moderation doesn&#8217;t pay as much as indulgence.</p>
<p>*&#8221;Mostly&#8221; because we&#8217;re not fanatical about it. If we&#8217;re out visiting friends or family and they serve a lunch with meat in it, we&#8217;ll say thank you and consume it &#8212; we&#8217;re mainly just trying to cut way, way back on it. Heck, if the Cattlemen&#8217;s Association shows up at my front door and hands me a steak, I&#8217;ll say thanks and include it in that night&#8217;s dinner, and also tell them I won&#8217;t ever be <em>buying</em> their dead cows, or encouraging others to order it.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Everyone. For years. As a grad student I knew what a parasite Elsevier was. Librarians hate Elsevier. You should hate Elsevier, if you don&#8217;t already. It&#8217;s a company with their boot on the neck of scientific information, and they&#8217;re one of the reasons you can&#8217;t easily get past the paywalls limiting access to information you already paid for.</p>
<p>Some editors are taking a stand and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/07/too-greedy-mass-walkout-at-global-science-journal-over-unethical-fees">walking out on Elsevier</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>More than 40 leading scientists have resigned en masse from the editorial board of a top science journal in protest at what they describe as the “greed” of publishing giant Elsevier.</p>
<p>The entire academic board of the journal Neuroimage, including professors from Oxford University, King’s College London and Cardiff University resigned after Elsevier refused to reduce publication charges.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering why…</p>
<blockquote><p>Elsevier, a Dutch company that claims to publish 18% of the world’s scientific papers, reported a 10% increase in its revenue to £2.9bn last year. But it’s the profit margins, nearing 40%, according to its 2019 accounts, which anger academics most. The big scientific publishers keep costs low because academics write up their research – typically funded by charities and the public purse – for free. They “peer review” each other’s work to verify it is worth publishing for free, and academic editors collate it for free or for a small stipend. Academics are then often charged thousands of pounds to have their work published in open-access journals, or universities will pay very high subscription charges.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Somehow we all work for Elsevier. We reinforce that because we voluntarily make our volunteer work in reviewing papers for the publishing companies part of our praiseworthy work listed in our tenure and promotion reviews.</p>
<p>We have to laugh at our situation.</p>

Known as R21, it is the first for malaria &ndash; or indeed any parasitic disease &ndash; to exceed the World Health Organization&rsquo;s 75 per cent efficacy target. Parasites are much more complex than viruses or bacteria, so this is a major breakthrough.</p> <p>Preliminary results from final-stage trials have not yet been published, but Ghana has already cleared the vaccine for use in children aged 5-36 months &ndash; the group at highest risk of death from malaria. Nigeria followed suit shortly afterwards. The WHO is still reviewing the data to determine whether it will recommend the vaccine for widespread use.</p> <p>Part of the challenge of targeting the malaria parasite is that it changes its structure throughout its lifecycle. R21 targets the parasite at a very early stage, before it has spread extensively throughout the body. This rapid response is helped along by an &ldquo;adjuvant&rdquo; (an ingredient that boosts the body&rsquo;s immune response to vaccines) called Matrix-M, which comes from the Chilean soapbark tree.</p> <p>Another major obstacle has been funding. Pharmaceuticals typically invest in vaccines expecting to recoup the costs by selling them to wealthy countries. But malaria mostly affects lower-income countries. R21 was developed by researchers at Oxford University&rsquo;s Jenner Institute, which also developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19. Their work was supported by awards from the European Commission, UK Research and Innovation, the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Serum Institute of India, among others. According to Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, it is the first major vaccine to be approved by an African country before rich nations.</p> <p>The new vaccine is no silver bullet. Doubts remain about the reported efficacy as trials continue, and about the practicalities of delivery, as it requires three initial doses and possibly boosters, which can be a challenge in rural areas. Funding for a widespread rollout also remains an issue.</p> <p>However, R21 marks a major scientific advancement and brings significant hope in the fight against one of the world&rsquo;s deadliest diseases. It comes on the back of two decades of impressive progress against malaria, mainly through the use of antimalarial drugs, insecticides and nets. The disease has already been eliminated in 15 countries since 2000. Global eradication once seemed impossible. Increasingly, it looks like a practical aim.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

It comes on the back of high-profile demonstrations in recent years that have seen groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Black Lives Matter take actions such as blocking roads, airports and printing presses in a bid to raise public awareness and push politicians into action. Some of the new restrictions came into effect just days before the coronation of King Charles III, ahead of anticipated anti-monarchy protests.</p> <p>The government says it &ldquo;fully supports the right of individuals to engage in peaceful protest&rdquo; but that the &ldquo;guerrilla tactics&rdquo; and &ldquo;serious disruption caused by a small minority of protestors has highlighted that more needs to be done to protect the public and businesses from these unacceptable actions.&rdquo; But if Rishi Sunak and his party &ldquo;fully support&rdquo; the right to protest, they&rsquo;re doing an impressive job of hiding it. They already introduced new restrictions last year, under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. That act increased the instances in which police could intervene in protests. Intentionally &ldquo;causing a public nuisance&rdquo; &ndash; an offence which could cover peaceful actions like blocking the entrance to a building, or occupying a public space &ndash; is now punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and the jailing of peaceful protesters has already begun.</p> <p>This new law goes further again. It introduces new criminal offences, including &ldquo;locking on&rdquo;, where protestors chain themselves to buildings or objects, a tactic that was famously used by the suffragettes in the 1900s. That is now punishable by up to six months in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.</p> <p>Also newly criminalised are &ldquo;obstructing major transport works&rdquo;, &ldquo;interfering with key national infrastructure&rdquo; (the government has specifically mentioned airports and printing presses, both of which have been the sites of climate protests), and &ldquo;tunnelling&rdquo;, which is defined as &ldquo;creating&rdquo; or &ldquo;being present&rdquo; in a tunnel, &ldquo;where such an act is causing or capable of causing serious disruption&rdquo;. This last offence seems to specifically target anti-HS2 protesters, some of whom have occupied tunnels.</p> <p>The law also allows magistrates to ban particular people from attending protests, and extends police powers, allowing officers to stop and search people without suspicion of any wrongdoing in and near protest sites. Under normal circumstances, police generally need to have &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; to suspect that someone is carrying an illegal item or something that could be used to commit a crime in order to stop and search them. Even then, the racial discrimination involved in that assessment of suspicion is well known and there is little evidence that it is an effective tool to fight crime. These efforts to pre-emptively clamp down on protests are deeply concerning.</p> <p>The Lords rejected some of the most serious provisions &ndash; including a government bid to restrict the use of the right to protest on &ldquo;an issue of current debate&rdquo; as a defence in court. But this is not enough.</p> <p>Human rights organisations, and some politicians and lawyers, have condemned the law as an assault on democratic freedoms. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T&uuml;rk, called on the government to reverse the legislation. The new law imposes &ldquo;disproportionate criminal sanctions on people organising or taking part in peaceful protests,&rdquo; he said, and is &ldquo;wholly unnecessary as UK police already have the powers to act against violent and disruptive demonstrations&rdquo;. Four UN special rapporteurs on rights have also expressed &ldquo;grave concerns&rdquo;.</p> <p>There is, unfortunately, little chance that the government will pay any attention to the international outcry. This regressive law is likely here to stay, with far-reaching consequences for our democracy.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Credit: Heritage Image Partnership" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/MPWRM3.jpg" height="1324" alt="'Night and Sleep' (1878), a painting by Evelyn De Morgan, shows two people drifting through the air" width="1920"></p> <p>Sleep is a hot topic these days. Popular science books promise to uncover why we do it at all, while exploring its importance for a healthy life. Self-help manuals seek to teach the art of sleeping well amidst the stresses of modern life. Wearable devices and mobile apps monitor quality and quantity, nudging users to make adjustments to their bedtime routines. Meanwhile, last summer&rsquo;s heatwave produced endless variations of top tips for ensuring the right amount of sleep in sweltering temperatures.</p> <p>These examples do not just point to an increased curiosity for an activity that, after all, makes up a third of our lives. Rather, they suggest a certain anxiety around sleep and a desire to master it. The key goal of Matthew Walker&rsquo;s international bestseller <em>Why We Sleep</em>, for instance, was to demonstrate the importance of sleep to a society that, he argues, all too often neglects it with disastrous consequences for our health. That was published in 2018. Since then, the idea that our society may be experiencing a &ldquo;sleep crisis&rdquo; has become more popular, with reports that people&rsquo;s sleep debt &ndash; namely, the difference between the amount of sleep they need and the amount they actually get &ndash; has been rising in recent years.</p> <p>This concern over the number of hours people sleep, or fail to, has led to growing attempts at regimenting and optimising the night-time, be it through sleep-tracking, sleep-hygiene routines and sleep hacks, relaxation apps, or other assorted gadgets, from smart mattresses to smart light systems. Underlying these attempts is the sense that sleep should be harnessed. As one popular sleep-tracking wearable puts it: &ldquo;Sleep more. Achieve more.&rdquo;</p> <p>In this landscape, Alice Vernon&rsquo;s new book <em>Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It</em> offers a breath of fresh air. Vernon highlights the need to widen our conversations around sleep beyond the anxious focus on maximising the number of hours we spend doing it. Her stories of troubled sleep purposefully steer well clear of the subject of insomnia &ndash; a condition that has been the core theme of a recent boom of memoirs, such as Marina Benjamin&rsquo;s <em>Insomnia</em> (2018) and Samantha Harvey&rsquo;s <em>The Shapeless Unease: A Year of Not Sleeping</em> (2020).</p> <p>Instead, Vernon turns her attention to sleep disorders like somnambulism (sleepwalking), sleep paralysis and hallucinations. And of course, the titular night terrors: terrifying dreams which will typically cause the sleeper to scream and bolt out of bed, and which, unlike nightmares, the sleeper will typically not remember upon waking. Through exploration of these phenomena, <em>Night Terrors</em> invites us to embrace the weirdness of sleep and to look more closely at aspects of our night lives that often thwart any attempts at control.</p> <h2>Gateway to consciousness</h2> <p>The book is many things at once: a vivid memoir of Vernon&rsquo;s own experiences of troubled sleep, an accessible account of the science of the sleep disorders that are collectively known as parasomnias, and a rich cultural history of how these disorders have been interpreted and represented throughout the centuries. Such a fluid approach feels fitting. Sleep is both a subject of scientific research, about which we know more and more, and a phenomenon that can still elude our rationality and even fill us with utter horror, producing endless theories and fuelling the imagination. In skillfully weaving the strands of the book together, Vernon perfectly captures the liminal status of sleep.</p> <p>Parasomnias, the focus of <em>Night Terrors</em>, are undesirable movements, perceptions, behaviours and emotions that arise as the brain transitions between REM (rapid eye movement) sleep &ndash; the stage when dreams tend to occur &ndash; non-REM sleep and wakefulness. These disorders, Vernon tells us, are quite common: 70 per cent of people experience a parasomnia at least once over the course of their life, typically sleep-talking or nightmares. She points out that the real percentage is probably even higher, given that a feature of some sleep disorders is that, upon waking, people do not have any recollection of what they have experienced during the night. What is more, people may be reluctant to talk about them: there is still a certain stigma attached to these &ldquo;sleep demons&rdquo;, which for centuries were explained away through the supernatural, or seen as a mark of insanity.</p> <p><em>Night Terrors</em> argues that we need to talk more about parasomnias, both to combat this stigma and to give voice to what these disorders tell us about ourselves. In Vernon&rsquo;s impassioned writing, parasomnias emerge as an important gateway into different forms of consciousness, both individual and collective &ndash; which we ignore at our peril. &ldquo;Our little upheavals or our major traumas&rdquo;, she writes, &ldquo;can all come back through the trapdoor of sleep, so to ignore this part of ourselves can mean that we never really face what our dreams are telling us.&rdquo;</p> <p>The reader&rsquo;s journey starts with the very first parasomnia that Vernon experienced as a child: sleepwalking. We then move on to hypnopompic hallucinations &ndash; primarily visual hallucinations that manifest moments after waking up; think spiders scuttling on your pillow. Later on, we explore sleep paralysis, night terrors and, finally, dreams and nightmares.</p> <p>A thread running through the book is the story of Vernon&rsquo;s claustrophobic and manipulative relationship with a former teacher, whom she calls Meredith after mara, &ldquo;an Old Norse word for a witch who would lie on people&rsquo;s chests and try to suffocate them&rdquo;. The mara is what we now know to be sleep paralysis, a parasomnia where the body&rsquo;s inability to move &ndash; preventing us from acting out our dreams and hurting ourselves or the people we sleep with &ndash; continues after waking up. The person is lying down, fully awake and conscious, and yet entirely unable to move. Even screaming is impossible.</p> <p>This is a paradoxical and terrifying situation. In response, the brain can conjure up images of sinister figures looming over the sleeper and weighing them down, to explain the sensation of being pinned to the bed and the feeling of pressure on one&rsquo;s chest and limbs. While Meredith&rsquo;s oppressive hold on teenage Vernon is linked to a number of Vernon&rsquo;s experiences of parasomnias, it is most clearly reflected in the sleep paralysis &ldquo;demons&rdquo; that populate her nights later on in her life. Vernon describes how, during sleep paralysis, she feels &ldquo;crushed under the intense stare of Meredith, under her hands and her sharp nails&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Sleep paralysis, nightmares and dreams</h2> <p>The chapter on sleep paralysis is among the most engrossing. Beyond exploring the science of this parasomnia and providing memoiristic insights into the trauma that lies at the root of her own experiences, Vernon traces how the disorder has shaped paranoid beliefs across the ages. Looking at the historical records of the 17th-century Salem witch trials, for instance, Vernon learns how experiences of sleep paralysis generated several accusations of witchcraft in the trials. More recently, this parasomnia is thought to be the origin of many reports of alien abductions that supposedly happened at night and were accompanied by a peculiar heavy feeling. &ldquo;What we see during sleep paralysis,&rdquo; Vernon explains, &ldquo;has changed significantly as our cultural depiction of monsters has shifted&rdquo;.</p> <p>Parasomnias seem to have always played a role in the cultural imagination. <em>Night Terrors</em> is peppered throughout with insightful readings of historical paintings and texts, many of which are iconic, that draw on these strange and powerful phenomena. Vernon&rsquo;s reflections on Dracula, the protagonist of Bram Stoker&rsquo;s 1897 novel, note that he causes paralysis, somnambulism and night terrors in his victims. He was not just a vampire, she concludes, but &ldquo;every parasomnia combined in the figure of a folkloric monster&rdquo;. Just as vampires straddle life and death so do parasomnias &ndash; during these sleep disorders &ldquo;the waking, rational self is effectively &lsquo;dead&rsquo;.&rdquo; The book goes on to illustrate how many of our famous writers, from Robert Louis Stevenson to Shirley Jackson, drew inspiration for their fiction from their real-life experiences of various parasomnias.</p> <p>But it&rsquo;s not just that parasomnias can inspire creativity or that culture can help shed light on these strange sleep phenomena. Rather, Vernon argues that storytelling can have therapeutic potential when it comes to sleep. She points to the DreamsID project, a collaboration between sleep scientist Mark Blagrove and artist Julia Lockheart, in which participants share their dreams, nightmares and other parasomnias, whose findings seem to suggest that the process encourages empathy. Imagery rehearsal therapy is also discussed: a cognitive-behavioural treatment for reducing the number and intensity of parasomnias, where the patient is helped to reimagine their nightmares with different, less terrifying outcomes. There are also attempts being made to harness lucid dreaming, which allows people to be aware that they are sleeping and therefore lets them direct their own dreams.</p> <p>There is something deeply liberating about <em>Night Terrors</em>&rsquo; invitation to encounter sleep on its own terms, in all its weirdness and darkness. As Vernon writes, &ldquo;sleep isn&rsquo;t just about the number of hours, [or] the time it takes to nod off . . . Sleep is about stories. It&rsquo;s about monsters, and ghosts, desires, aggression, trauma and anxiety, health, creativity, and the state of our inner lives.&rdquo; Her book is a powerful reminder of what we miss when we think of sleep merely as something to master, in order that we might be more productive in the day.</p> <p><em>Alice Vernon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It&rdquo; is published by Icon.</em></p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Zagreus, your character in Hades" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Wallpaper_Zagreus01.jpg" height="1079" alt="The character Zagreus from Hades wear Ancient Greek-style clothing and carries a sword" width="1920"></p> <p>In <em>Hades</em>, as in life, death is inescapable. In the former, however, death is something you end up looking forward to. It takes a while to get used to; getting killed is usually the one thing you try to avoid in video games. It means you&rsquo;ve failed, and that you have to start again. But in Supergiant Games&rsquo;s 2018 offering, you can&rsquo;t win the game unless you die again, and again, and again. Dying&rsquo;s the whole point. It&rsquo;s what makes you stronger.</p> <p>After all, your character, Zagreus, is immortal. He is the son of Hades and he lives in Hell, but he wants out. That&rsquo;s the premise. You grab a weapon, leave your chambers and run towards the surface. You fight your way through the worlds of Tartarus, Asphodel and Elysium, as your dad sends hordes of enemies to try and stop you. If Greek mythology is your thing, you will recognise many of their faces, from the Erinyes and the Lernaean Hydra to the double threat of Asterius and Theseus. If it isn&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t worry: you&rsquo;ll become acquainted with it soon enough. God, you&rsquo;ll get acquainted with it.</p> <p>You will be killed by the Furies and killed by the three-headed monster; the king and his bull will kill you and send you down the river Styx, and you will wake up back where you began and you will start again. If it sounds tedious, please understand that it isn&rsquo;t. <em>Hades</em> has won a dizzying number of awards and demand was such that it was eventually released on every single major gaming console.</p> <p>It was so successful, in fact, that Supergiant announced in December that a sequel is coming in 2023. In <em>Hades II</em>, chthonic nymph Melino&euml; will attempt to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time. In doing so, she will have to die again, and again, and &ndash; you get the gist. The game is predicted to be one of the biggest indie releases of the year.</p> <h2>Playing dead</h2> <p>It is an unexpected turn of events. &ldquo;Roguelikes&rdquo;, as this genre of game is called, have been around for many years, but this is the first time one of them has hit the mainstream in such a way. What do I mean by &ldquo;roguelike&rdquo;? Well, it&rsquo;s complicated. I can tell you that the name comes from <em>Rogue</em>, an ASCII game released in 1980. I can tell you that the term was popularised in Usenet discussion groups in the early 1990s. I can tell you that any attempt to describe the concept fully and in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t anger anyone would take the rest of this essay. Instead, and at risk of making many enemies among the genre&rsquo;s purists, I will sum it up this way. A &ldquo;roguelike&rdquo; &ndash; or &ldquo;roguelite&rdquo; &ndash; is, to most people, a game that involves &ldquo;permadeath&rdquo;, i.e. losing means having to start again from the very beginning.</p> <p>It is an unusual format. Video game files usually save at the beginning of a level or an encounter with a villain, meaning that dying is an annoying but relatively minor setback. In order not to be mind-numbingly repetitive, each roguelike &ldquo;run&rdquo;, as the attempts to go through the game are called, is subtly different. Enemies appear in a different order, there are different rooms, or different weapons, upgrades and rewards to pick from. These are the basics.</p> <p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Hades_Aug19_04.jpg" height="1080" alt="A scene from Hades shows Zagreus navigating a green land" width="1920"></p> <p>As you can imagine, the games are often as rewarding as they are frustrating. You can play better than you ever had, then make one tiny mistake, one slip-up, and you are back at square one. This is presumably why roguelikes took their time to reach more casual gamers, who will only tolerate so much frustration in their pursuit of victory.</p> <p><em>Hades</em> was a game-changer because it acknowledged its own reality. Zagreus knows he has died; when he crawls out of Styx, characters welcome him back and affectionately mock his failure. As a result, new subplots and lines of dialogue can only be unlocked by dying a number of times. Losing doesn&rsquo;t feel like a failure because it isn&rsquo;t one; it is the only way to progress.</p> <p>It feels like a beautiful and heavy-handed parable, and a reflection on the very nature of roguelikes. As a more casual gamer myself, I was entranced by <em>Hades</em> and, once I finished it, sought out other games like it. I found <em>Dead Cells</em> and <em>Slay The Spire</em>.</p> <p>In the first, I was an amorphous creature able to capture decapitated corpses and use them to fight my way out of a mysterious island, using whatever weapons I could find along the way. In the second, I flitted between being a monk, a soldier, a huntress and an automaton. Using &ldquo;defence&rdquo;, &ldquo;attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;skill&rdquo; cards, I faced enemies until I was able to escape from the tower I was held in.</p> <p>Both games are more traditional examples of their genre. The character I am playing does not know they have been doing the same thing over and over again, or if they do, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to the story. Instead, in them, I am Zagreus: the burden of knowledge falls on my shoulders. I may get the occasional upgrade but, on a fundamental level, the only thing that matters is my endurance, my willingness to fall, stand back up and go again.</p> <h2>One way out</h2> <p>The only way to win is to become a better player, and the only way to become a better player is to keep playing until I know every inch of the game like the palm of my hand. I can only win by being able to predict the patterns of the various enemies, by knowing when I should attack and when I should retreat, by doing things without thinking because I have done them so many times already.</p> <p>I also need to know and understand myself as a player: which weapon am I best at wielding? What are my weaknesses? How can I best make use of my strengths? It is a deeply personal &ndash; and occasionally emotional &ndash; endeavour. Like romantic love, roguelikes force you to witness, understand and cherish what is in front of you, what is within yourself and how the two interact with each other. They make you reckon with the importance of seemingly small details and the flaws you wish you didn&rsquo;t have.</p> <p>They also offer hope in a way that love doesn&rsquo;t always, because they allow you to forget it all and start again. We&rsquo;ve all longed to play god with our own lives, to go back to an interaction we had minutes or months ago and perform as a better version of ourselves. It is a desire that these games can fulfil. If you die at the hand of a monster who unexpectedly hit you twice instead of once at the start of a fight, you can dust yourself off, go back and move away as he prepares to hit again.</p> <p>Finally, there is joy to be found in their familiarity. There is a point you reach with roguelikes, after 30, 50, 70 runs, when the game begins to feel like home. Everything is predictable and there are no surprises anymore. It feels like watching a movie for the hundredth time when stuck at home with a cold, or listening to your favourite songs if you are feeling stressed. Sometimes, nothing is as soothing as a controlled environment.</p> <p>Given the dark and gory nature of many of these games, it can lead to some amusingly absurd moments. I watched the trailer for <em>Hades</em> to jog my memory before writing this and sighed with warm nostalgia at the sight of Charon, who ferries souls into the Underworld. What can I say? We&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time together, he and I.</p> <p>Many other people did too; well over a million of them, in fact. Perhaps that is because they also found the real world, in all its stressful unpredictability, a bit hard to deal with. Retreating into a world of endless, sometimes hypnotising repetition can be a balm to the soul.</p> <p>I like to think that they have also read about <em>Hades II</em> and Melino&euml; and look forward to getting to know her, as if she were a friend or a lover. If you&rsquo;re one of them, there&rsquo;s only one more thing I can add: I&rsquo;ll see you all in Hell.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

The College is a non-profit community youth development organisation that uses magic to offer hope to young people in and around Cape Town.  They do incredible work and for the past two years I have been working with them and Vanishing Inc (the largest magic retailer in the world ) to produce a unique  magic booklet and custom deck of cards for budding magicians. </p>

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer.

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
