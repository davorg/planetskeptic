            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">The war in Ukraine is draining American stockpiles of things that blow up, so the defense industry has come up with a clever scheme: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/100-mile-strike-weapon-weighed-ukraine-arms-makers-wrestle-with-demand-sources-2022-11-28/">take a bomb we have in plentiful supply, strap a rocket motor to it (also plentiful) and send those off to a war to blow more stuff up.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted onto abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines as the West struggles to meet demand for more arms.</p>
<p>U.S. and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Boeing&#8217;s proposed system, dubbed Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), is one of about a half-dozen plans for getting new munitions into production for Ukraine and America&#8217;s Eastern European allies, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Although the United States has rebuffed requests for the 185-mile (297km) range ATACMS missile, the GLSDB&#8217;s 94-mile (150km) range would allow Ukraine to hit valuable military targets that have been out of reach and help it continue pressing its counterattacks by disrupting Russian rear areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>How am I supposed to feel about this? I am entirely sympathetic to the Ukrainian cause and opposed to the militaristic imperialism of Russia, but our solutions to the conflict all seem to involve more, bigger, longer-ranged bombs…which leaves defense contractors chortling in glee, and may be necessary to throw invaders out of a foreign land, but I am repulsed by the idea of more effective killing machines.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that everyone is so blithe about the cost. It&#8217;s cheap, they say.</p>
<blockquote><p>The M26 rocket motor is relatively abundant, and the GBU-39 costs about $40,000 each, making the completed GLSDB inexpensive and its main components readily available. Although arms manufacturers are struggling with demand, those factors make it possible to yield weapons by early 2023, albeit at a low rate of production.</p></blockquote>
<p>They don&#8217;t say how much the M26 costs, but I&#8217;d guess that the total cost of a single GBU-38 + M26 is going to exceed the yearly salary of a college professor, so sure, I&#8217;ll just visualize it as every shot is a teacher&#8217;s or scientist&#8217;s career being lobbed at a couple of soldiers to explode into fragments, and the money instead finding its way into a lobbyist/contractor&#8217;s pockets.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine. Everything is fine.</p>

<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/covid-deaths-headline.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/covid-deaths-headline-500x215.png" alt="" width="500" height="215" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68597" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/covid-deaths-headline-500x215.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/covid-deaths-headline-150x64.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/covid-deaths-headline-300x129.png 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/covid-deaths-headline-768x330.png 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/covid-deaths-headline.png 1038w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Great. My demographic. Although, while I am over 65, I&#8217;m not sick or poor, so I can take some solace in that…except that I don&#8217;t think being old, sick, or poor should mean you get neglected by society, and I don&#8217;t think any of us should be categorized as an acceptable loss.</p>
<blockquote><p>More than 300 people are still dying each day on average from covid-19, most of them 65 or older, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While that’s much lower than the 2,000 daily toll at the peak of the delta wave, it is still roughly two to three times the rate at which people die of the flu — renewing debate about what is an “acceptable loss.”</p>
<p>And while older Americans have consistently been the worst hit during the crisis, as evident in the scores of early nursing home deaths, that trend has become more pronounced. Today, nearly 9 in 10 covid deaths are in people 65 or older — the highest rate ever, according to a Washington Post analysis of CDC data.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this disease does get me, I&#8217;m going to raise a bony finger to point at all the heedless younger people who don&#8217;t believe in masking, or any other basic preventative measures. And I&#8217;m especially planning to claw my way out of the grave to knock on the doors of all those people who think that saying &#8220;it&#8217;s just a flu&#8221; is an excuse for ongoing contempt for core concepts in epidemiology. Or anyone who claims the pandemic is over.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/shamsie.jpg" height="500" alt="Kamila Shamsie's 'Best of Friends'" width="500"></strong></p> <p><strong>Best of Friends</strong> (Bloomsbury) by Kamila Shamsie</p> <p>Kamila Shamsie&rsquo;s blazing 2017 novel <em>Home Fire</em>, winner of the Woman&rsquo;s Prize and longlisted for the Booker, is a contemporary retelling of Sophocles&rsquo; play Antigone; an account of radicalisation and Islamophobia from the perspective of a Muslim family navigating life in Britain. <br><br><em>Best of Friends</em> is a more introspective work, looking at the decades-long friendship of two women who move from Karachi to London. In terms of tension, it&rsquo;s a slow burn. The book is divided into two parts. The first depicts their adolescence at a prestigious school in Karachi in the 1980s where their attachment is first cemented and tested. Their school years are set against the backdrop of President Zia&rsquo;s dictatorship and abrupt death and the rise of Benazir Bhutto, who becomes the country&rsquo;s first female prime minister in 1988. <br><br>While Maryam is nonchalant about her studies, Zahra is bookish and works hard. Maryam&rsquo;s family is well-off and she has the self-assurance of the entitled, safe in the knowledge that she will inherit the family business from her grandfather one day (she doesn&rsquo;t). Zahra&rsquo;s family are not as affluent or well-connected. Shamsie focuses on a single defining experience: the &ldquo;girlfear&rdquo; the friends feel as teenagers when they are taken on a dangerous joy ride by two young men. <br><br>Thirty years later, Shamsie uses the device of a <em>Guardian</em> feature and a media profile to demonstrate the friends&rsquo; successful integration in London. Zahra has become the director of a well-known civil liberties group and Maryam is a top venture capitalist. Maryam swiftly recognises: &ldquo;England taught you the subtleties of language &ndash; &lsquo;When did you arrive here?&rsquo; was something you never wanted to hear; &lsquo;When did you move here?&rsquo; was fine. The movers had options, the arrivers simply followed a trajectory out of a hellhole and washed up on some better shore.&rdquo; Maryam and Zahra clearly represent the immigrants Britain welcomes. It&rsquo;s a subject Shamsie knows well (she moved to London in 2007 and is now a dual national) and pertinent observations like these are threaded through the novel. <br><br>Maryam courts the British government for her own ends, whereas Zahra tries to expose its shortcomings. Their different moral outlooks are spotlit when Zahra tries to help someone legitimately obtain leave to remain. She is horrified by the conditions of the deportation centre she visits. By contrast, Maryam pulls strings to gets an enemy from their past deported.<br><br>Shamsie&rsquo;s exposure of the UK&rsquo;s immigration system is as acute and damning as her exploration of counter-terrorism policies in <em>Home Fire</em>. She highlights the government&rsquo;s hypocritical acceptance of successful migrants, and disdain for those who are of no financial value. Pakistan and Britain may be worlds apart politically but, as Shamsie slyly suggests, when the ruling class let inequality, cronyism and corruption take root, these divisions narrow.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition.</em><em> <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="The Prince of Wales and the Queen in Westminster Abbey, 1975" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/charles.jpg" height="923" alt="The Prince of Wales and the Queen, 1975" width="1300"></p> <p>If the establishment of the Church is not often on display to the British public, it certainly was during the accession of King Charles III. Around the country, as public authorities proclaimed the King&rsquo;s accession, God and the Church of England have been not just prominent, but very often presiding. Charles was proclaimed king &ldquo;by the Grace of God&rdquo;, and after much speculation, it has been confirmed that he will bear the title &ldquo;Defender of the Faith&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;Defender of Faith&rdquo; as some (though not him) had suggested. Like almost all English monarchs in the 500 years since it was first awarded, he will bear the traditional title of the supreme governor of the Church of England.<br><br>But for the first time in recent history, the Church of which the new monarch is the supreme governor is not the Church of their subjects. Most of those subjects don&rsquo;t even believe in God. Putting aside doctrine and practice (which has never been a majority activity), when Queen Elizabeth II acceded to the throne, most of her subjects in Britain probably at least identified as Anglicans and certainly looked to that Church for life events such as weddings and funerals. <br><br>In 2022, only 12 per cent of the new king&rsquo;s British subjects say they are Anglicans, most funerals are non-religious, and only 10 per cent of weddings are Anglican. Being a committed Anglican no longer makes a monarch of like mind and habit with their people; it sets them apart.<br><br>Does this matter? Those from the &ldquo;No God, No Master&rdquo; school of the humanist tradition will give a resounding &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ndash; down with the whole lot and a secular republic yesterday, please! But there is an arguable rational basis for a constitutional monarchy, and so there are others who would like a monarchy they can support with a clear conscience and which can play a unifying role.<br><br>In any case, whether you have a rational preference for continued monarchy or not, all but the most optimistic republican must admit that we are likely to live within a constitutional monarchy for the foreseeable future. So the question is relevant: can a monarch coming to the throne today plausibly be a national figurehead at the same time as being entangled by law with a religious institution which is alien to nearly 9 in 10 of their people? Is this compatible with our diverse and mostly non-religious society?<br><br>First of all, we should distinguish the personal religious commitments of the monarch from their institutional role. Obviously it is true that a man of personal religious convictions can be head of state and protect freedom of belief for all. At an international conference on global freedom of religion or belief, when still Prince of Wales, King Charles gave one of the most humanistic speeches I have heard at such an event in nearly 20 years. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>. . . a diversity of voices and interests is absolutely essential, if we are to achieve our shared goal of ensuring that everyone everywhere is able to follow their chosen religion or belief in peace and safety. Freedom of conscience, of thought and of belief is central to any truly flourishing society. It allows people to contribute to their communities without fear of exclusion, to exchange ideas without fear of prejudice and to build relationships without fear of rejection. A society where difference is respected, where it is accepted that all need not think alike, will benefit from the talents of all its members. Where there is discrimination, we know only too well, there is disempowerment, darkness and division.</p> </blockquote> <p>I spoke in the same opening session of that conference and said practically the same thing. So it is clear that people of good will can speak the same language in respect of human rights and freedom of belief. We are not asking if a Christian in public life can defend and guarantee freedom of belief for all. What we are really asking is whether a monarch who must also be the supreme governor, defender and promoter of the Church of England can.</p> <p>The King clearly believes these two roles are compatible. In a speech to selected religious leaders shortly after his accession, he affirmed that his oath to maintain the Church of England existed for him alongside the &ldquo;duty to protect the diversity of our country&rdquo;. He vowed to &ldquo;respect those who follow other spiritual paths as well as those who live their lives in accordance with secular ideals&rdquo;. Like his speech to the international ministerial, his words were ones to gladden any humanist:</p> <blockquote> <p>The beliefs that flourish in, and contribute to, our richly diverse society differ. They, and our society, can only thrive through a clear collective commitment to those vital principles of freedom of conscience, generosity of spirit and care for others which are, to me, the essence of our nationhood. I am determined, as King, to preserve and promote those principles across all communities, and for all beliefs, with all my heart.</p> </blockquote> <p>These words must be the most progressive and inclusive ever voiced by a British monarch. In contrast, at her jubilee in 2012, Queen Elizabeth II spoke of &ldquo;the significant position of the Church of England in our nation&rsquo;s life&rdquo;:</p> <blockquote> <p>The concept of our established Church is occasionally misunderstood and, I believe, commonly under-appreciated. Its role is not to defend Anglicanism to the exclusion of other religions. Instead, the Church has a duty to protect the free practice of all faiths in this country . . . gently and assuredly, the Church of England has created an environment for other faith communities and indeed people of no faith to live freely.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was clearly an attempt to depict a &ldquo;hospitable&rdquo; establishment, and to say that a liberal state Church can mediate the diversity of contemporary society. But are such statements enough? Can freedom of religion or belief truly exist in a society with an established state religion &ndash; even if that religion purports to be a protector of all religions or beliefs? Even historians friendly to the Church have analysed its actions in past years as attempts to preserve its own power. The King&rsquo;s inclusion of &ldquo;secular ideals&rdquo; in his remarks following his accession was welcome, but no one with these ideals was invited to hear them &ndash; only religious representatives were.</p> <h2>Power and exclusion</h2> <p>Of course, today&rsquo;s Church of England is not the wannabe theocracy of previous centuries. From the late 17th to late 19th centuries, other groups gradually acquired equality before the law with Anglicans: first all non-Anglican Protestants, then Roman Catholics, Jews and the non-religious. In the 21st century, equality laws deriving from Europe have been incorporated into UK law in a way that has reduced and in some cases outlawed discrimination on grounds of religion or belief. In 1998, the Human Rights Act gave us all the statutory right to freedom of religion or belief for the first time. <br><br>But the established status of the Church still exerts a pernicious effect in the UK. One in five schools in England and Wales is run by the Church of England, allowed to legally discriminate against children on the basis of beliefs they are too young to hold for themselves. Twenty-six unelected bishops sit in our legislature, able to vote on legislation. This globally egregious set-up has a negative influence on British politics. The Church is a fierce lobbyist for religious privilege, from laws allowing religious parents priority access to certain state-funded schools, and laws mandating Christian worship in all state schools, to laws allowing religious discrimination in the provision of public services. The UN and other human rights bodies have highlighted these features of the UK as incompatible with freedom of religion or belief.</p> <p>Can a head of state uphold one while still defending the other? On a symbolic level, the idea of a &ldquo;hospitable establishment&rdquo; sets up unpleasant dynamics of power and exclusion. In this context, we non-Anglicans are guests, not homeowners. &ldquo;Toleration&rdquo; is not the same as inclusion and empowerment. This is most uncomfortable at moments of national or public ceremony, which are routinely presided over by the priests of the Church. One litmus test for the extent to which the monarchy will be serious about reflecting today&rsquo;s Britain or not would of course be the coronation, which &ndash; it has already been confirmed &ndash; will be an Anglican ceremony.<br><br>In 2015, I was a member of the Commission of Religion and Belief in British Public Life, which made the recommendation that &ldquo;All those responsible for national and civic events, whether in the public sphere or in Church, including the Coronation, should ensure that the pluralist character of modern society is reflected.&rdquo; This was a mild recommendation from my point of view. In 2018 Bob Morris of the UCL constitution unit recommended a secular ceremony in Westminster Hall as part of the coronation. That seems to me a minimum requirement. The 2012 Olympic opening ceremony was widely seen as a successful modern ceremony that modelled the diversity of society as well as the core values that unite us. Ceremonies around the commencement of a new reign &ndash; a much more significant moment in our national life &ndash; are surely an opportunity for new symbolism, making a statement about inclusion and the importance of freedom of religion or belief for all.</p> <h2>An opportunity for change</h2> <p>The House of Windsor is the last European royal family to practise coronations. The others have either replaced them with simpler ceremonies or never practised them in the first place. Most monarchies today only require a simple oath to be taken in the presence of the country&rsquo;s legislature. <br>In the Netherlands, which has a secular state with clear separation of religious and political authorities, King Willem-Alexander, personally a Protestant, was sworn in at a ceremony in 2013 in the Nieuwe Kerk, a decommissioned church. The ceremony took place in a joint session of the two Houses of Parliament. The King was confirmed in office and swore to be faithful to the Constitution and to discharge the duties of his office. In Belgium, King Philippe&rsquo;s ceremony involved only a solemn oath to &ldquo;abide by the constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, maintain the country&rsquo;s independence and preserve its territory&rdquo; before members of the two Houses of Parliament.<br><br>Even states with established Churches don&rsquo;t involve elaborate religious rituals. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, whose established Church is almost as entangled with the constitution as that of England, was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace in 1972 by the Prime Minister with no formal enthronement. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden chose not to be crowned in 1973, but simply took office during a meeting of the cabinet and, afterwards, was enthroned in a simple ceremony in the Royal Palace.</p> <p>Change is possible, and has occurred in recent eras. Charles III&rsquo;s great-grandfather presided over the end of the established Church in Wales; his great-great-great-grandmother was the last monarch of an established Church in Ireland; even his late mother was only &ldquo;Defender of the Faith&rdquo; in Australia until the 1970s when the title was abolished there. Being supreme governor of the Church has not always required committed Anglicanism. Lutherans, Catholics and monarchs whose private commitments we shall never know have all held the title. There is enough flexibility in principle for a new coronation and a new reign to herald a larger vision.<br><br>You might not think this matters much. I said earlier that there was a rational case for monarchy &ndash; but I think it is fair to say that most people&rsquo;s support for the institution is emotional. Most people don&rsquo;t concern themselves with academic questions of constitutional nicety or with religious questions. Why not just keep them all in a box marked &ldquo;tradition&rdquo;? <br><br>But this misses an opportunity to say something genuinely meaningful to the people of this country. We are undoubtedly a largely pro-monarchy country. But the British public don&rsquo;t value monarchy because the monarch is Defender of the Faith. They value it because they see it as a stabiliser and unifier during difficult times. Its symbolic events provide an opportunity to come together and express national identity in the 21st century. If that role is to continue, those opportunities need to change just as much as our identity has.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">The cringiest. Some group of Musk cultists created a cryptocurrency called <a href="https://elongoat.io/#home">ElonGOAT</a>, and decided to promote it in the goofiest way they could think of: by building a monument to Elon Musk. </p>
<blockquote><p>Elon GOAT Token has really stepped outside the box and did something no other Crypto project has dared to do. We built Elon Musk a $600,000 monument on the back of a semi trailer in honor of his many accomplishments and commitment to Cryptocurrency! Since completion, $EGT has toured several states in the US and has now decided to deliver this gift to Elon at Tesla’s Giga factory in Austin!</p>
<p>We believe that Elon’s potential acceptance of this biblical sized gift could catapult $EGT into the limelight and accelerate its various initiatives.</p>
<p>$EGT’s future is bright with our ambitious plans to launch EGT PRO’s merchant processing solutions in early 2023. We also believe with proper execution the subsequent run at multiple centralized exchange listings will take us to the top!</p></blockquote>

<p>Right. So they&#8217;ve invented some fake money, and they think the way to get people to invest in it is to spend $600,000 on an ugly-ass statue to get Elon Musk&#8217;s blessing. They&#8217;re also selling 5,000 NFTs…oops, I just stole one.</p>
<p>They also invented an &#8216;event&#8217;, driving this statue to the Tesla factory to convince Musk to tweet about them, which would somehow vastly increase the value of their precious imaginary coin. They&#8217;re urging everyone to buy buy buy now, before the anticipated Elon Tweet sends the price skyrocketing to the moon. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the entire foundation for its value, getting a nod of acknowledgement from the petty god they worship. They&#8217;re <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/elon-goat">chattering away about it online</a>. They&#8217;re <a href="https://twitter.com/ElonGoatToken"><em>begging</em> Elon Musk to come out and appreciate their work on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>That was from 15 hours ago, and was the last comment from the people dragging this statue to Austin. Maybe we can take a peek at how well their scheme is working.</p>

<p>Oops. The line go down. They lost 60% of their value the day they delivered their monstrosity.</p>
<p>Part of the problem might be that, goddamn, this is the ugliest statue I&#8217;ve ever seen. Maybe they&#8217;ve finally found a way to embarrass Elon Musk.</p>

<p>I mean, look at that thing! It&#8217;s Elon Musk&#8217;s head grafted onto the body of a goat, riding a rocket. It&#8217;s hideous. What drugs were they taking when they came up with that thing? I need to know so I never ever take them myself.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a pile of aluminum scrap. Musk is going to pretend it doesn&#8217;t exist because taking ownership would mean he&#8217;d have to get it melted down, another expense added to his long list of woes. Although, I do have to admit that an ugly wasteful lump of metal built to celebrate stupidity and delusions might be the most appropriate monument for Elon Musk.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="K-pop band BTS are kings of South Korea's soft power" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/BTS.jpeg" height="585" alt="K-pop group BTS" width="1024"></p> <p class="p1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Gangnam Style&rsquo; is a socio-cultural commentary on South Korea&rsquo;s hyper-consumerism and material pursuit&rdquo; reads the label next to a glass case containing a pink suit. The outfit belongs to the pop star Psy, who made the song and accompanying dance world famous (the &ldquo;Gangnam Style&rdquo; music video was the first YouTube clip to earn over a billion views). That was back in 2012. Now Korean popular culture &ndash; the <em>hallyu</em> or so-called Korean Wave &ndash; has earned its own exhibition in the UK&rsquo;s prestigious V&amp;A Museum in London.</p> <p class="p2">There is something delightful about imagining the curators working out how to word the labels for this collection of artefacts: a range of early video games reveals the pioneering spirit of early web caf&eacute; culture, cute outfits like Psy&rsquo;s are displayed, while their pop songs play on multiple screens. The exhibition sums up K-pop as: &ldquo;adored worldwide for its polished performances that blend catchy tunes and heartening lyrics, stunning visuals and powerful dance steps.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p2">You may not need the V&amp;A to tell you that K-pop now has a global reach, or to recognise the faces of these pretty, androgynous stars. In October, the BBC World Service led with news that the members of BTS &ndash; the south Korean boy band &ndash; were going to do their military service and would not be exempt. The possibility had been discussed, due to their contribution to Korea&rsquo;s global standing; they have even addressed the United Nations general assembly.</p> <p class="p2">South Korea has not just re-branded itself, but built global economic success on its popular culture. Given that the three decades after the Korean War ended in 1953 were marked by political repression meted out by the paramilitary government, this was a remarkable transformation. In the 1990s, South Korea transitioned from autocracy to democracy. The strategy of promoting culture appears to have been triggered by striking economic data: in 1993, the film <em>Jurassic Park</em> earned more money in South Korea than the major car manufacturer Hyundai. One can&rsquo;t help wondering if this promotion of culture might also have helped to harness the energy of South Korea&rsquo;s young population, and embed its new democratic identity.</p> <p class="p2">The success of South Korea&rsquo;s policy extends to cinema (Oscar-winning <em>Parasite</em> and <em>Minari</em>) and television (<em>Squid</em> <em>Game</em>), following years of critical acclaim for directors such as Park Chan Wook (<em>Oldboy</em>) and Bong Joon-ho, whose films <em>The Host</em> and <em>Snowpiercer</em> won him global fans before <em>Parasite</em> got its three Oscars.</p> <p class="p2">Is there a lesson for the UK? Cultural leaders in Britain from screen, stage and the music industry have been pleading for years for the Conservative government to recognise the significant value of the export earnings of British culture, along with the boon to tourism. They pleaded for better support for the arts during the pandemic lockdowns, only to be answered by the government&rsquo;s much-mocked skills retraining poster campaign, apparently suggesting that ballet dancers might instead find a job &ldquo;in cyber&rdquo;, whatever that might mean.</p> <p class="p2">Education policy, too, has been re-angled to emphasise the funding of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) as if they were in a competition with the humanities. Music, drama and language provision in state schools is plummeting. All of which gives the impression that the British government is either oblivious or tone deaf to the economic value of our creative industries.</p> <p class="p4">That&rsquo;s not to say all is rosy in the world of the Korean Wave. K-pop acts are formed like a factory product: from their teenage years, artists are drilled and groomed into a uniform standard of beauty. While the likes of BTS may be speaking up about climate change and LGBTQ+ pride, there is something unsettling about the image of perfection their fans aspire to emulate.</p> <p class="p2">South Korea is a world leader in something less savoury than cultural exports, too. It has the highest rate of cosmetic surgeries in the world, with an estimated one in three South Korean women under 30 having procedures.</p> <p class="p2">Even so, there is a frankness in South Korean culture about the dark side of its success. One of the most powerful exhibits in the V&amp;A exhibition is the ugly set of the basement flat from <em>Parasite</em> &ndash; semi-underground &ndash; typical of those in which many poor urban families live.</p> <p class="p2">What is inspiring is how South Korea has dared to see the value of storytelling and song. The country has built a cultural and economic force out of the power of its citizens to dream; whatever darkness, as well as beauty, those dreams might reveal.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/HW4X8M.jpg" height="748" alt="Cyclists in Stockholm" width="1289"></p> <p class="p1">On a hot June day in the Swedish sub-arctic, the smell of pine combined with dust from the freshly dug soil. Here on the edge of the small city of Ume&aring;, squeezed between a hockey stadium and the end of the airport runway, I met locals and refugees who had come together to grow fruit and vegetables. The project is part of an organisation called Friends in Ume&aring;, a grassroots network of volunteers that organises everything from jogging sessions to gardening and games nights, helping new arrivals adapt to a region where, in the winter, there are just three hours of daylight and temperatures regularly dip below minus ten. </p> <p class="p3">One of the project&rsquo;s success stories is Samir. Originally from Iraq, he came to Sweden in 2015 and now works at the local Volvo plant. He is also honorary taxi driver to the other volunteers, ferrying people around in his pristine estate car. The north of Sweden is a place of opportunity for those who make their homes here, and in Ume&aring;, Somalians, Iraqis and Syrians are an important part of the small city&rsquo;s increasingly international outlook.</p> <p class="p3">As they worked on their vegetable patch in 31 degree heat, the refugees did not know it yet, but their situation was about to get worse. Twelve weeks later, when Sweden went to the polls, the far-right party, the Sweden Democrats (SD), would achieve unprecedented power. The biggest party in Sweden&rsquo;s right-wing group, the far-right upstarts have risen from rank outsiders to become the second biggest party in the country. They are now crucial partners to its ruling Conservative coalition government.</p> <h2 class="p3">Sweden's political crisis</h2> <p class="p3">The rise of the Sweden Democrats has forced Swedes and the rest of Europe to reconsider Sweden&rsquo;s reputation as a tolerant society and a safe haven for refugees. In a warning to supposedly stable democracies, a country that was long seen as Europe&rsquo;s progressive beacon has proven itself just as susceptible to the siren calls of far-right populism as any other. With links to Viktor Orb&aacute;n&rsquo;s Fidesz movement and Georgia Meloni&rsquo;s Brothers of Italy, the SD have made Islamic migrants scapegoats for Sweden&rsquo;s growing inequality and spikes in violent crime. Following a record-breaking election in which they got 20 per cent of the vote, they now pull the strings as part of a co-operation agreement with the traditional conservative bloc.</p> <p class="p3">Former refugees like Samir may be safe: with permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship he is beyond the reach of the immigration system. But the Friends in Ume&aring; work with others who are not so lucky. Hussein lives in a modest apartment on the city&rsquo;s fringe and makes a living mowing lawns and pruning hedges for wealthy Swedes. He is one of thousands of refugees granted asylum but unable to gain permanent residency. &ldquo;I applied for permanent status in December 2021 and nine months have passed,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;In March I got a message from the Migration Agency and I contacted them and they just said wait some more, and wait some more.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Hussein is Hazara, an ethnic group persecuted both in his native Afghanistan and in Pakistan, the country he fled to as a child. His family was killed in bomb attacks targeting Hazaras in the Pakistani city of Quetta. Aged just 14, he fled through the Middle East to Europe, eventually gambling on the long trip north to Sweden. &ldquo;I came from hell,&rdquo; he says, pointing to a scar on the back of his head, where shrapnel lodged in the bomb attack.</p> <p class="p3">People like Hussein now face an uncertain future. The new government has made noises about pausing citizenship applications and reviewing the status of those who are legally in the country. The Sweden Democrats have pushed the idea of repatriation hard and want to reduce asylum to the EU&rsquo;s lowest possible baseline, whilst the government as a whole has promised a tougher regime.</p> <p class="p5">To understand how the far right ended up as a powerful force behind Sweden&rsquo;s government, we have to look back at the political crisis leading up to the vote in September. Stefan L&ouml;fven of the centre-left Social Democrats led the country until November 2021, when he resigned and the finance minister Magdalena Andersson replaced him.</p> <p class="p3">During the 2015 refugee crisis, L&ouml;fven had declared that &ldquo;My Sweden does not build walls&rdquo;. But the country soon began to follow other EU states in tightening borders and stepping up deportations in response to growing public opposition to migration. Andersson barely had time to move into her official residence before facing one of the most toxic elections Sweden has ever seen.</p> <p class="p3">The election campaign saw the Social Democrats track further to the right to try and head off attacks from their opponents. Desperation to get into power pushed traditional right-wing parties far beyond what was previously acceptable in Swedish political debate, in a potent combination of culture war rhetoric and welfare nationalism.</p> <h2 class="p3">Channeling Trump in Gotland</h2> <p class="p5">In early July, the European heatwave was still baking Sweden and the island of Gotland in the Baltic sea teemed with people. I was on the island to witness the annual gathering of Sweden&rsquo;s political leaders, followed attentively by lobbyists, diplomats and the press. Everyone was gearing up for the elections.</p> <p class="p3">When Ulf Kristersson, leader of the conservative Moderate party, stepped onto the stage, he had one aim; to paint himself as the tough guy Sweden needed to whip the country back into shape. Just two years earlier, the diminutive politician had staged a carefully choregraphed photo-op with a Holocaust survivor to convince the public of his commitment to human rights and his opposition to far-right politics. In Gotland, however, he cemented his transformation from liberal conservative to populist outrider by explicitly thanking the SD for &ldquo;daring&rdquo; to talk about migration.</p> <p class="p3">Afraid of being labelled a fascist-facilitator, Kristersson referred to Sweden&rsquo;s emerging new right alliance merely as &ldquo;his side&rdquo;. But throughout the election campaign, his message was clear, that getting the old centre-left party out of government and getting tough on crime and migration were more important than splitting hairs over who would be in the new administration.</p> <p class="p3">The problem for the Moderate party was that whatever they could do, the Sweden Democrats could do better. The SD&rsquo;s charismatic and folksy leader Jimmie &Aring;kesson worked the crowd in Gotland flawlessly. &Aring;kesson casts himself as a straight-talking rural boy. He wears his shirt sleeves rolled up and speaks in a well-rehearsed vernacular that cements his image as a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Swede far from the political elite. Surrounded by security, he signed off with the promise that the SD would &ldquo;make Sweden good once again&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">The SD world view is a utopia of white picket fences, low crime and safe small towns where the buildings fly Swedish flags rather than pride flags. The party has tapped into discontent across the political spectrum, building a base featuring everyone from ethnic nationalists to business-minded political climbers. Aided by a formidable network of alternative media and a talent for turning news events into political opportunities, they have cast themselves as the ally of everyone from struggling single mothers to businessmen burdened by high taxes.</p> <p class="p3">Across from where &Aring;kesson spoke, party members sold baseball caps with the letters SD emblazoned on them and T-shirts saying &ldquo;Stop Socialist Feminism&rdquo;. The vitriol directed against Magdalena Andersson, Sweden&rsquo;s first female Prime Minister, recalled the Trumpist obsession with Hilary Clinton. Manning the stall was Rebecka Rapp, resplendent in a white trouser suit and a designer belt, topped off with one of the signature baseball caps. The same age as Hussein and Samir, she told me she joined the SD because they offered a solution to the economic stagnation and crime that the party says is endemic in Swedish cities. She repeated a line that many across the country echoed during the election campaign &ndash; the SD is the only party taking gangs, urban segregation and a spike in gangland shootings seriously. &ldquo;Just this morning there was a stabbing right here in town,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That shows you how dangerous things have become.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">A few hundred metres away, police had indeed locked down the street after a civil servant who was attending the week of political speeches was stabbed to death in plain sight. But this was not evidence of the wave of migrant-related gang crime that the SD warned of: it later came to light that the killer was a member of radical far-right group the Nordic Resistance Movement. The killer&rsquo;s ultimate target was Annie L&ouml;&ouml;f, the leader of Sweden&rsquo;s liberal Centre party, who has become a hate figure on the nationalist right for her commitment to multiculturalism. The killing of a senior government employee and attempted assassination of a political leader should have caused the country to sit up and think, but this was not a normal election campaign.</p> <h2 class="p4">The Gang of Four</h2> <p class="p5">With one week to go before polling day, the city of Eskilstuna, an hour west of Stockholm, resembled many others across Sweden. In the town square, little huts belonging to each political party housed activists handing out leaflets and badges, whilst voters went from group to group listening to what they had to offer. Eskilstuna used to be a stronghold of the Swedish left, but here too the SD has made huge inroads in the last decade. Their stall was a hive of activity. Party Secretary Richard Jomshof was in town. He is one of the powerful group known as the Gang of Four, a close-knit circle of friends that has steered the SD project from bomber jackets and army boots to golf tops and deck shoes.</p> <p class="p3">Jomshof was flanked by security guards as he stepped on stage in front of the town hall. His speech was devoted entirely to why Islamic culture and migration threatens Sweden&rsquo;s very existence.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;I have been re-reading the Qur&rsquo;an,&rdquo; he told the crowd, &ldquo;and for me it is clear that Islam is an inherently violent religion.&rdquo; He rolled through the dog whistles of European cultural nationalism. Muhammad was a warlord who kept sex slaves. Christianity is the basis of European values and the Enlightenment project. Islamic Swedes can never hope to be fully functioning members of society. He finished with a resolute &ldquo;Go home.&rdquo; In the crowd of onlookers there were just a few people not applauding.</p> <p class="p3">Also in the square was a woman in a hijab holding a homemade sign saying &ldquo;No racists in our Streets and Squares&rdquo;. Someone in the crowd turned and asked what she was doing there. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m protesting,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I have read your manifesto and I know what you think about Muslims and migrants.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s name was Babra, a long-term Eskilstuna resident who sees the Sweden Democrats as interlopers in her hometown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here for what seems like a hundred years,&rdquo; she told me, &ldquo;and suddenly I&rsquo;m told that I&rsquo;m not welcome. These people have no place on our streets.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p4">Not just the Sweden Democrats</h2> <p class="p5">The problem for Sweden&rsquo;s migrants is that the SD is now everywhere, in every council and every region in the country. Its emergence over the past 15 years has emboldened critics of migration and multiculturalism in other parties, too. The 2022 election campaign saw politicians across the spectrum float ideas such as ethnic quotas for housing, testing immigrant children for ADHD to reduce crime, and mandatory language tests for children as young as two. Even before they gained power, the SD had helped to push Sweden a long way from the country that opened its doors to the world in 2015.</p> <p class="p3">Election night itself was a tense affair, with just one per cent separating the left and right blocs. Late in the evening the right bloc took the lead and scenes of jubilant SD members were broadcast across the country. Ulf Kristersson claimed victory for his right-wing side but his conservative Moderate party ended up losing votes to the far right. It was clear from the jubilant scenes at the SD party, and the newly emboldened far-right glitterati on TV, who the real winners were.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;I can remember the moment it changed,&rdquo; said Per Kristiansson, a priest with the Church of Sweden. His parish covers the multicultural housing projects of Roseng&aring;rd in the city of Malm&ouml;, one of the areas of deprivation that were front and centre in the election campaign. &ldquo;I was sat in a radio studio with someone from the border police and they said that there weren&rsquo;t any safe havens any more.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Kristiansson was on the frontline when Malm&ouml;, Sweden&rsquo;s third city and the gateway to continental Europe, became the main entry point for those seeking asylum in Sweden during the 2015 crisis. Gradually, the mood changed. People went from welcoming refugees with open arms to blaming them for the city&rsquo;s social problems.</p> <h2 class="p4">A story of social exclusion</h2> <p class="p5">Crime in Sweden&rsquo;s poorer multicultural suburbs was a central focus in the election campaign. This was not entirely baseless: the truth remains that too many young people are being drawn into the criminal underworld. Already, this year holds the record for the highest number of shootings ever officially recorded, almost all located in housing projects in major cities. The new right bloc&rsquo;s proposed solution is tougher policing and sentencing, and suspension of certain civil liberties. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. There is a deeper story of social exclusion here; foreign-born residents are four times as likely to be unemployed as Swedish-born citizens.</p> <p class="p3">Hussein remembers well the experience of pitching up without any knowledge of Swedish society. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of people in Sweden who end up as gangsters because they don&rsquo;t have other options. If you don&rsquo;t get your residency permit and go to school or study then you can&rsquo;t work, not even as a carpenter or a bus or a truck driver. Without a social security number you&rsquo;re nothing,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;The problem is, if you do everything right you still don&rsquo;t always get a good deal. For those of us who worked through high school we can still get rejected. We just want to pay tax, be normal people.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">The new government, which benefited from portraying Sweden as a country in crisis, now has to prove it has the answers to these problems. Kristersson&rsquo;s victory was accompanied by international headlines comparing Sweden to Hungary and Poland. Though he is no doubt keen to avoid such comparisons, one of the government&rsquo;s first steps was to nominate SD politicians to influential parliamentary committees. Emboldened right-wing commentators are already calling for radical reform of public service media. Reducing overseas aid is one of many policies being presented as &ldquo;sensible&rdquo; and &ldquo;fiscally responsible&rdquo; alongside hardline migration and justice reforms.</p> <p class="p3">What is perhaps most alarming is just how easily Swedish conservatives pivoted to working with the far right, finding common ground and united by a shared hatred of the left. By welcoming the SD into power, it is not clear whether Sweden&rsquo;s new Prime Minister is aware of what he has helped to create, or indeed whether he cares.</p> <p class="p6"><em>Some names have been changed</em></p> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

Many thanks to Kurtis for the pleasant surprise: So I stumbled upon your blog, really liked what I saw, read that you had drama with the domain name owner, bought it, and forwarded it here.
