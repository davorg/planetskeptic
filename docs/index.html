<p>Iles was formerly the  Managing Director of the Australian Christian Lobby, and was kicked out because he was terrible at his job and godless Australians kept winning legislative victories while membership in the organization declined. Let&#8217;s hope he keeps his losing streak going!</p>
<p>There are many people at Answers in Genesis who have stood by Ham &#8212; I really wonder about the internal politics here, when the Big Boss brings in a total stranger over the heads of the existing staff and announces that he will be the next man in charge. I almost feel sorry for Bodie Hodge, his son-in-law, who has now been officially passed over.</p>

<p class='lead'>Also, up is down. <a href="https://popular.info/p/inside-the-campaign-to-cancel-sex">George Orwell saw it coming.</a> A woman named Kelly Schenkoske gave a talk in Philadelphia and made a remarkable assertion.</p>
<blockquote><p>During the session, Schenkoske strongly objected to the concept of &#8220;consent&#8221; being included in sex ed curriculum. She argued that teaching kids about consent is counterproductive and leaves children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. “[K]ids are often taught to be obedient.&#8221; Schenkoske said. “And to teach kids consent is a shift away from really strongly teaching, it&#8217;s okay to have those really strong boundaries and to say no, because not always do kids have that faculty to strongly say no.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So, she opposes sex ed and the principle of consent because knowing that you have the power to refuse sex is a suggestion that you will obediently consent. It makes no sense. But then, Schenkoske is a member of Moms For Liberty, so you already know it&#8217;s garbage.</p>
<p>She even makes the Orwellian comparison explicit.</p>
<blockquote><p>On August 15, Schenkoske promoted a post stating, “Diversity is segregation&#8221; and &#8220;Inclusion is exclusion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Her audience was just as awful. </p>
<blockquote><p>The session concluded with the opportunity for audience members to ask Schenkoske questions. “In Michigan, we voted on Proposal 3… we literally voted our parental rights away,” one audience member said. “[W]e have lost our parental medical rights of our children… the schools have all the things that they are able to pass out, the abortion pills, they are able to start transgender, trans, you know… Your child can go to the clinic between 2nd and 3rd hours and have their abortion pill… This is in our middle school and high schools.” Later the audience member said, “[a] boy can start the process of cutting his penis off right there in his high school on his lunch.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Now there&#8217;s an image. What is gender affirming care? That&#8217;s when you hand a schoolkid a steak knife and let him hack away at body parts. I don&#8217;t know what they were thinking to specify that it happens on lunch hour &#8212; does he saw it off and slap it on a hot dog bun? There are weird twisty things going on in these people&#8217;s brains.</p>

<p class="lead">Yesterday, I set up a cage for <i>Steatoda borealis</i>. I haven&#8217;t successfully raised them in the lab, probably because I haven&#8217;t fine-tuned their environment, but I thought I&#8217;d give it another try. I caught these individuals living in a communal environment (my compost bin), so I made a substrate of moss, for burrowing in, and added 5 females, all in the same confined space.</p>
<p>I came in today, and what do I find? They&#8217;ve built a communal web and they&#8217;re all perched on it, spaced about 2cm apart. This is already interesting.</p>
<p>Something to know about <i>S. borealis</i>: the adult males are distinctive, they have palps that look like massive medieval instruments of war, while the females have slender palps. I was pretty confident I&#8217;d segregated them by sex accurately, on the basis of casual inspection.</p>
<p>So I added a male this morning. All the spiders seemed somewhat agitated, there was much scurrying and tapping and exploratory sensory behavior, as I would expect. The male was courting the biggest, plumpest female in the cage.<br />
Then, to my immense surprise, two of the females (I think) paired off, and one of them was aggressively thrusting its skinny little palps at the others genitals. Whoa, what? Did I misgender them, or was this some kind of social behavior?<br />
Then I get dragged away to attend some <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/08/17/be-it-resolved-2/">fucking meeting</a>, and couldn&#8217;t inspect them more carefully. This was extremely annoying, as you might guess.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m intensely curious. I&#8217;ve searched the literature, there is no mention of male dimorphism in this species, but it&#8217;s an interesting possibility that warrants further investigation. The other possibility is female:female sexual behavior &#8212; these spiders are somewhat social compared to others I&#8217;m working with, so it could be some kind of bonding behavior? Another possibility is that I&#8217;m fooled by juvenile males that exhibit typical sexual behavior but just haven&#8217;t completed their final molt to acquire their gloriously developed sexual organs. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be putting them under the microscope tomorrow to find out.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/fusion-medical-animation-rnr8D3FNUNY-unsplash.jpg" height="1080" alt="A visualisation of the Covid-19 virus" width="1920"></p> <p>During the early days of the pandemic around 3.5 per cent of people who caught Covid-19 in the UK required hospitalisation. Many studies have highlighted the importance of factors such as age, weight (or body mass index) and existing conditions to an individual&rsquo;s risk of infection, hospitalisation and death. But it also turned out that the picture was more complex.</p> <p>From the earliest days of the pandemic, there was an explosion of large studies trying to understand how our genetics might help explain the virus&rsquo;s diverse and often mysterious disease trajectory. One such effort was from a global consortium of doctors and scientists known as GenOMICC, which had already been looking into genetic determinants of severe illness following infection.</p> <p>Over the first two years of the pandemic, tens of thousands of samples were taken from critically ill Covid patients, many from intensive care units. Analyses were then conducted to try to identify genes that might be associated with the worst patient outcomes. Severe responses to Covid-19 often involve a total breakdown in normal immune signalling. This can result in a dangerous influx of normally helpful immune cells and proteins into the sites of infection (lungs, in this case). It is therefore not surprising that many of the 49 genetic variants identified as being associated with critical illness from Covid code for proteins involved in immunity.</p> <p>In May, in the journal <em>Nature</em>, GenOMICC reported finding links between severe Covid and a wide range of genes and their patterns of activity. Encouragingly, some are already known targets of existing drugs that could potentially be repurposed for treatment of severe Covid. The report also identified an association between severe illness and multiple genes involved in how the virus actually enters the patient&rsquo;s cells. These findings provide useful insights into how an individual&rsquo;s route to infection, as well as their biological response to it, may determine why some people get critically ill with Covid, whilst close to a third of us have no symptoms at all.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

All are in Africa and Latin America: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Mali, Sudan, Venezuela and Cameroon.</p> <p>Sudan&rsquo;s inclusion on the list is notable because the research for the report was done in 2022 &ndash; before the outbreak of violence between the military junta and the rebel Rapid Support Forces that has killed thousands and displaced millions since April.</p> <p>Already in 2022, a third of Sudan&rsquo;s population required aid amid a political and economic crisis and the impacts of climate change, according to the NRC, but less than half of the required funding was received. What&rsquo;s more, the country was hosting over a million refugees from other countries, many of whom have now had to flee again.</p> <p>There was a spike in coverage of the crisis after the outbreak of war this year. Data from Google Trends, which gives an indication of how much the search engine&rsquo;s hundreds of millions of users are following a topic, shows that searches for &ldquo;Sudan&rdquo; rose quickly in April. But by May they had more or less returned to previous levels, even though the conflict and accompanying atrocities are far from over. By contrast, searches for &ldquo;Ukraine&rdquo; remain elevated nearly 18 months after the war began.</p> <p>The UK has created no safe passage for refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan. Home Secretary Suella Braverman suggested that those wanting to seek asylum in Britain could present themselves to the UN Refugee Agency for resettlement, but such a scheme doesn&rsquo;t exist. Neighbouring countries, particularly Egypt and Chad, are hosting hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees alone, with the potential for instability to spill over.</p> <p>The UK and other governments could and should be doing so much more, from creating asylum routes to providing humanitarian aid and engaging in serious diplomatic efforts. But far from that, the UK has actually cut aid to many of these neglected crises in recent years.</p> <p>&ldquo;None of these countries is neglected by accident,&rdquo; the report authors write. &ldquo;The powerful response to the suffering inflicted by the war in Ukraine has shown that neglect is in fact a choice. Where there is the will, political action can be impactful and swift, funding vast, and media coverage extensive.&rdquo; Humanitarian compassion cannot be based on geopolitics. While there is a limit to what we can do as individuals, we urge our readers to keep learning about these crises and pushing for action wherever possible.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

This means that adults are considered to have given their consent to be a potential organ donor after their death unless they specifically say they don&rsquo;t want to be.</p> <p>The change will likely save many lives. Ten to 15 patients die each year in Northern Ireland while awaiting a transplant. Currently, there are around 150 people on the waiting list. The new law is named after six-year-old D&aacute;ith&iacute; Mac Gabhann, who has been waiting for a heart transplant for five years. His family fought for the change in law, alongside campaigners who pointed out that 90 per cent of people in Northern Ireland supported organ donation but only half were signed up to the Organ Donor Register.</p> <p>The trend towards opt-out across the UK mirrors the rest of Europe. Most of the continent has now shifted to an opt-out system. However, when it comes to advancing organ donations, the evidence shows that opt-out legislation is often insufficient on its own.</p> <p>Public education is key. Under soft opt-out systems, like those in the UK, family members can intervene to block a donation after a relative&rsquo;s death &ndash; this often happens because families aren&rsquo;t sure what their relative wanted, so it&rsquo;s important that people talk about their beliefs and intentions. But above all, systems to identify opportunities for donations and good matches with patients need to be improved. That could take many forms, including new technologies. The National Institute for Health and Care Research and the NHS are helping to fund the development of a system using artificial intelligence. Researchers believe that AI could prove more effective than surgeons at examining donor organs and assessing their suitability for transplant.</p> <p>The team estimates that the new system could result in up to 200 more patients receiving kidney transplants and 100 more receiving liver transplants every year in the UK.</p> <p>The move towards opt-out organ donation is a positive sign of societal progress. Increasing the availability of organs for donation will only become more important as our populations age, meaning that a lower percentage of organs will be suitable for transplant. Demand always outstrips supply, and we must carry on doing what we can, whether through changing legislation, public awareness or technological progress.</p> <p>Organ donation saves lives, and anything that helps one more organ reach a patient in need is a change worth fighting for.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/red-dot-Q98X_JVRGS0-unsplash-_1_.jpg" height="1440" alt="Polling station" width="1920"></p> <p>The local election in May was the first UK election to implement new regulations that require voters to show a photo ID. Fears that this requirement would prevent some people from voting &ndash; weakening British democracy and risking the disenfranchisement of marginalised groups &ndash; were confirmed.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission&rsquo;s full report is expected in September, but its interim report published in June revealed that nearly 14,000 people were denied a vote (the Commission noted that these figures are likely an underestimation). Roughly 0.7 per cent of people were initially turned away from stations for not having an admissible form of identification, such as a passport, driving licence or voter certificate. Most of those people returned later with the correct ID and were able to vote but there were still at least 0.25 per cent who tried to and could not.</p> <p>What is harder to measure is how many people simply stayed at home on the day because they did not possess the right form of ID, and how many turned back before they reached the ballot-issuing desk &ndash; some polling stations warned people at the entrance about the requirement and the number of voters leaving at this point was not recorded. As a result, we will likely never know the full impact.</p> <p>Due to electoral rules, it was not possible to collect comprehensive demographic data. But a small survey carried out by the Electoral Commission suggested that &ldquo;some people found it harder than others to show accepted voter ID, including disabled people and the unemployed.&rdquo; This appears to confirm concerns that the new regulations would have the gravest effect on people already marginalised and therefore less likely to have the correct ID, including ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Photo ID has already been required in Northern Ireland for two decades. Toby James, a professor of politics and public policy at the University of East Anglia, told MPs that about 2.3 per cent of the electorate failed to vote in the first Northern Ireland assembly election following the introduction of the requirements as a direct consequence, and that it would be reasonable to expect a similar figure across the UK. If accurate, that will mean the voices of 1.1 million people who want to have a say on our next government will go unheard because of the rule.</p> <p>The justification for voter ID requirements is that they will prevent people voting in somebody else&rsquo;s name at polling stations &ndash; an offence known as &ldquo;personation&rdquo;. Yet this justification does not stand up to scrutiny. In 2019 there were just two allegations of personation at polling stations that resulted in cautions or convictions, out of 58 million votes cast in the UK that year.</p> <p>That gives rise to the question of the true motivation. Given the groups most affected, critics see a cynical attempt by the Conservative government to disenfranchise voters who might be less inclined to support them. In an extraordinary statement at the National Conservatism conference in May, former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg appeared to admit as much &ndash; though he noted that the ploy may have backfired.</p> <p>&ldquo;Parties that try and gerrymander end up finding their clever scheme comes back to bite them, as, dare I say, we found by insisting on voter ID for elections,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We found the people who didn&rsquo;t have ID were elderly and they, by and large, voted Conservative, so we made it hard for our own voters and we upset a system that worked perfectly well.&rdquo;</p> <p>Elections need to be secure, but they also need to be as accessible as possible. At best, the voter ID requirement weakens our democracy without adequate justification. At worst, it is a profoundly undemocratic attempt at voter suppression. Whichever it is, the outcome is the same: Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of disenfranchisement at the next general election.</p> <p><em><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->
