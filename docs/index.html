<p class='lead'>Mary is off to spend a week with our granddaughter, and it&#8217;s been a struggle. She&#8217;s supposed to have just gotten her own priorities straight &#8212; you know, packing, loading the car, that sort of thing &#8212; but instead she&#8217;s been fussing over me, as if I&#8217;m going to be helpless.</p>
<p>The cat&#8217;s even worse. When she sees <em>luggage</em> appear by the back door, she knows something is up and has been freaking out and puking all over the place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be fine. I got a week&#8217;s worth of lectures organized and queued up this morning, and am looking forward to making a jambalaya loaded up with shrimp (Mary doesn&#8217;t like shrimp, so usually have to leave them out), and then, of course, the wild parties at my house starting tonight.*</p>
<p>*There will be no wild parties, sorry to say. Teaching resumes Monday.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that the whole point of science? You keep gathering empirical evidence and adjust your interpretations as you go, in order to keep your hypotheses and theories in alignment with the real world. It&#8217;s how science hones itself and gets better and more accurate.</p>

Think of those mountain men who&#8217;d go off into the wilderness alone and hunt and fish and trap and live off the land, to return after months or years with a sledge loaded with valuable animal pelts. They were awesomely self-sufficient. We have degraded over time, to the point where some men are little more than weak parasites on society who depend on others to tend to their frail, fragile selves and pathetic needs.</p>
<p>I speak, of course, of American conservatives.</p>

<p>These smug, self-satisfied little &#8216;men&#8217; chortle and laugh as they&#8217;re asked if they would rather do dishes or laundry…and admit with an air of pride that they don&#8217;t do either. Not only are they ineffectual and incapable, they are <em>vain</em> about their deficiencies. It makes them a special elite, I guess.</p>
<p>Listen. It makes them spineless atavisms.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what a <em>real man</em> should be able to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cook a healthy meal.</li>
<li>Clean up after themselves.</li>
<li>Maintain their clothing and their home.</li>
<li>Sew a button.</li>
<li>Humanely remove a spider from a room without squealing.</li>
<li>Change a diaper.</li>
<li>Have a relationship with a <em>partner</em>, not a servant.</li>
<li>Call their mother.</li>
<li>Cry when appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>(This is what a real woman should be able to do, too, so maybe it&#8217;s a list of what real humans do.)</p>
<p>These guys have gone from whining about &#8220;stand up straight&#8221; and &#8220;clean your room&#8221; to bragging about their incompetence at elementary chores. I do all those things, including washing dishes and doing laundry, and I&#8217;m a wokefied candy-ass liberal who uses pronouns.</p>
<p>On the bright side, American conservatives are on the road to extinction.</p>

They&#8217;re often more motivated than American students, and if they go back to their home country after a few years with a little sympathy for the US, that&#8217;s a net gain for us. Or if they decide they want to stay in the US, that&#8217;s also a net gain. We can&#8217;t lose by freely sharing education with the world (it&#8217;s also a good idea for American students to study abroad). We all win.</p>

<p class="lead">Some people have been pushing the idea that COVID-19 was artificially created in a Chinese lab. There&#8217;s no real evidence for that &#8212; the virus itself doesn&#8217;t contain any labels of its origin, that a research lab in China was studying the virus isn&#8217;t evidence of manipulation (a research lab researching is what research labs do), and the people promoting the &#8216;lab leak&#8217; theory all seem to have a political agenda to blame someone. I sure haven&#8217;t been convinced. Now there&#8217;s a new revelation: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/03/covid-origins-research-raccoon-dogs-wuhan-market-lab-leak/673390/">they&#8217;ve found genetic evidence from samples collected at the Huanan wet market that infected wild animals were there</a>.</p>
<p>Way back in 2019, researchers were swabbing locations in the market and filing away samples for later analysis. Guess what? It&#8217;s later. Swabs sampled from a stall that was selling raccoon dogs have been sequenced, and they&#8217;ve found … raccoon dog DNA, which is no surprise. But they also found lots of SARS-CoV-2 mingled with it, which tells us that these wild animals were already infected with COVID.</p>
<blockquote><p>A new analysis of genetic sequences collected from the market shows that raccoon dogs being illegally sold at the venue could have been carrying and possibly shedding the virus at the end of 2019. It’s some of the strongest support yet, experts told me, that the pandemic began when SARS-CoV-2 hopped from animals into humans, rather than in an accident among scientists experimenting with viruses.</p>
<p>“This really strengthens the case for a natural origin,” says Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory who wasn’t involved in the research. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist involved in the research, told me, “This is a really strong indication that animals at the market were infected. There’s really no other explanation that makes any sense.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been that interested in the question of its origin. I already know that we live on a planet of viruses, with an unimaginably huge population of diverse viruses squirting their DNA and RNA into every available creature, genetic material that is constantly mutating at a rapid rate, and what we ought to be amazed at is that we have molecular mechanisms of resistance, an immune system, that can cope with it at all. It was inevitable that something would evolve to get past our defenses, and that we&#8217;d have to adapt or die. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been doing for the entirety of the existence of life on Earth.</p>
<p>That life changes and that there are naturally inimical forces that exist is an uncomfortable truth for many people. They&#8217;d rather think that a threat is by intent, that it had to be <em>designed</em>, and that the solution is to march out and do battle with a hostile, and purposeful, enemy (in this case, all of China. Good luck with that, I&#8217;d rather deal with it by improving public hygiene and developing new medicines.)</p>
<p>Now, can we stop wasting time looking for someone to blame, and refocus on dealing rationally with the pandemic? Unfortunately, there are many people who think the way to deal with a threat is to ignore it and pretend it has gone away. It hasn&#8217;t. The viruses keep on changing, thriving on the neglect that gives them an opportunity to proliferate in all these hosts who have given up, and it&#8217;s only going to get worse.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Survival-of-the-Richest.jpg" height="696" alt="The book's cover shows an island against an orange backdrop" width="431"></strong></p> <p><strong>Survival of the Richest: Escape fantasies of the tech billionaires</strong> (Scribe) by Douglas Rushkoff</p> <p>It&rsquo;s difficult for a book to live up to the racy subtitle &ldquo;Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires&rdquo;. This is the problem with which professor of media theory and digital economics Douglas Rushkoff saddles himself. His book, entertaining and necessary though it is, never quite lives up to its marketing. The subject is tech billionaires and &ldquo;The Mindset&rdquo; with which they tackle the problems of the world. In the author&rsquo;s eyes, The Mindset is the belief that with enough money, the elite can leave behind the messy debris of real life and start afresh, either in the real world or in some kind of virtual reality. He phrases it elsewhere as &ldquo;the Insulation Equation&rdquo;: can the tech titans &ldquo;earn enough money to insulate themselves from the reality they were creating by earning money in this way?&rdquo; Hence Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s Metaverse and the attempts made by both Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to blast themselves into space.</p> <p>Rushkoff is onto something here, and he has great fun skewering the pomposity of these men. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if they want to build a car that goes fast enough to escape from its own exhaust,&rdquo; he writes. He quotes psychedelics professor Timothy Leary who observed, back in 1990, that the architects of our digital future were male nerds attempting to create something like their idea of a perfect woman: &ldquo;a predictive algorithm could anticipate their every need in advance and deliver it directly, removing every trace of friction and longing&rdquo;. At no point in the book are you in any doubt as to where Rushkoff stands. His villains are so cartoonish that we remain on his side, but there is sometimes a little too much scorn and not enough substance.</p> <p>Survival of the Richest includes pertinent paragraphs about Covid-19, underlining both the extent to which the super-rich could simply exist happily in their own bubbles and the fact that the conditions of the pandemic not only made billionaires richer but also produced brand-new billionaires. The unprecedented disruption was proof that if the richest people in the world didn&rsquo;t want to interact with the poorest, they simply didn&rsquo;t have to.</p> <p>Rushkoff is right not to trust the heads of the &ldquo;technopoly&rdquo;, who conquer, colonise and dominate. Theirs is a brutal quest for progress, valuing technology over people. &ldquo;The experience of wealth and power is akin to removing the part of the brain &lsquo;critical to empathy and socially appropriate behaviour&rsquo;,&rdquo; the author writes.</p> <p>This is all well and good &ndash; or all well and terrible, rather &ndash; but, given that Rushkoff&rsquo;s book begins with an enticing story in which he speaks at a &ldquo;super-deluxe resort&rdquo; to five ultra-wealthy tech bros who talk to him surprisingly candidly about their underground bunkers, it&rsquo;s a little pale by comparison. This opening hints at the insight and detail about the &ldquo;escape fantasies&rdquo; that we hope the book will provide. But as it proceeds, we get a passionate screed against Silicon Valley rather than an exclusive look at the ways tech billionaires are trying to dodge death.</p> <p>We&rsquo;ve got ourselves into a huge amount of trouble, Rushkoff thinks, and the people really running things want us never to get off the treadmill, generating more content, earning more money. Their goal is the &ldquo;relentless pursuit of growth&rdquo; &ndash; growth never questioned by the population at large. As speed becomes more important than anything else, AIs now increasingly carry out work that humans could or should &ndash; and the tech giants have become terrified of the potentially superior intelligence they have helped to create. Rushkoff&rsquo;s take on the whole affair is a weary and comic one, but there is also real sadness. The world, he thinks, could have been so much better than this.</p> <p>The book&rsquo;s proposed solutions have been criticised for not being sufficiently radical. But Rushkoff wouldn&rsquo;t argue that they were radical. What&rsquo;s necessary, he writes, is a return to a pre-Mindset metabolism; de-prioritisation of growth; slowing down. Reject growth for growth&rsquo;s sake, embrace community action, and stop making the ultra-rich even richer. &ldquo;There is no escape, and there is no later,&rdquo; he ends the book by saying. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re not doing it at the moment, we&rsquo;re not doing it at all.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

At least not officially. From August 2020, an unofficial one was run in Glasgow for around ten months by Peter Krykant. He invited people into the back of his makeshift ambulance, converted from a second-hand minibus, and gave them a safe space to inject cocaine and heroin. It is the closest the UK has come, despite having the highest rates of drug-related death in Europe.</p> <p>Injecting drugs is a risky activity &ndash; even when it is done in the carefully controlled environment of a hospital, with high-quality pharmaceuticals, experienced healthcare professionals and single-use sterile equipment. Injecting heroin in a filthy public toilet, by yourself, with someone else&rsquo;s needle, is often desperate. There is the risk of damage from the needle, infection from the re-used needle and syringe, and the fact that if it all goes wrong and you overdose, there is no one to help you. You&rsquo;ll die, despite the fact there is an easily administered and highly effective antidote.</p> <p>Drug-related death rates in England have been rising for a decade and now outstrip comparable tolls in Europe. The highest rates are across the north-east, while Blackpool in the north-west is a pocket of pain. Scotland, meanwhile, stands in a grim league of its own &ndash; the sick man of Europe, with 1,330 deaths related to drug misuse in 2021. Comparisons are complicated, but Scotland has about four times more deaths than the worst countries in Europe and, by some calculations, more than 20 times as many deaths as the EU average. It&rsquo;s carnage.</p> <p>Most of the risks are due to the illicit nature of drugs. There is no way of knowing the dose, no way of even knowing for sure if that brown substance is actually heroin, and you&rsquo;ll only find out how potent it is when it is coursing through your veins. Heroin, in the form sold on the street, needs to be dissolved in water, usually with the help of a little acid. If you are living on the streets, or in a squat, water isn&rsquo;t always easy to get and people use water from puddles, from toilet bowls, even their own saliva.</p> <p>Botulism, tetanus and necrotising fasciitis are regularly seen in people injecting drugs in the UK. Any re-use of needles is hazardous. Needles blunt quickly with use &ndash; ask any hapless soul who has been repeatedly stabbed by a junior doctor as they try to get blood. Blunt needles cause even more damage, tearing fragile veins and leaving them liable to clotting. And used needles can harbour hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. Often all three.</p> <h2>One man's mission</h2> <p>Krykant saw the urgent need to tackle the problem in Glasgow. He is an activist; not medically qualified but motivated by the insight from his own past experience of heroin addiction. Although his ambulance project was short-lived, it was effective. In less than a year, he supervised nearly 900 injections by 835 people and nine overdoses were tackled. No one died and lives were saved. On one occasion, he was arrested and charged under the Misuse of Drugs Act, but Scotland&rsquo;s public prosecutor dropped the case.</p> <p>His audacious, law-defying actions have galvanised activists. The push for drug consumption rooms is now at the leading edge of the drive for evidence-based harm-reduction interventions.</p> <p>Any human activity which could harm us, and that we are unlikely to stop despite those harms, can usually be squinted at through a harm-reduction lens. As it relates to drug use or laws, this means any policy or programme that reduces the negative effects. The approach is grounded in evidence, and aims to improve conditions both for the individuals concerned and for society. So who could possibly object?</p> <p>The chief opponents are those who believe that complete abstention and prohibition should be mandated. Arguably, peak abstention was reached in the 80s and 90s with the &ldquo;Just Say No&rdquo; advertising campaign championed in the United States by then-First Lady Nancy Reagan. But the prohibitionist &ldquo;War on Drugs&rdquo; continues to this day. And while there are those who don&rsquo;t believe any drug use is acceptable, others have variable thresholds and levels of tolerance.</p> <p>Drug consumption rooms are a case in point. The first was opened in Berne, Switzerland in 1986. They now exist in 16 countries around the world, with Greece, Iceland and Mexico recently joining well-established services in Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada &ndash; and, of course, Switzerland. The UK is lagging behind the rest of the world. Yet the picture is complex, as Britain has embraced other harm-reduction strategies &ndash; such as needle exchanges and methadone programmes.</p> <h2>A history of harm reduction</h2> <p>The UK has a proud history of harm-reduction activism, which can be traced back to the response in the 1980s to the emerging threat of HIV. There were several projects across the country, but two cities featured notably: Edinburgh and Liverpool. In Edinburgh, Roy Robertson, a GP and now Professor of Addiction Medicine, was involved in research that tested for HIV in the stored blood samples of 164 people who were known to be injecting drugs. The results were published in 1986 in the British Medical Journal. Just over half were found to be HIV positive. An obvious relationship had been found between sharing injecting equipment and the spread of HIV.</p> <p>This important research came at a time when community pharmacies were scaling back the provision of injecting equipment, apparently at the request of police who were also confiscating it. As a result, a tight-knit group of people were sharing syringes and needles &ndash; and, of course, the HIV virus. HIV was spiralling out of control and an urgent response was needed.</p> <p>Around this time, the public health team in Liverpool had become convinced of the need to establish needle exchange schemes to tackle the problem. Liverpool was one of the first British cities to establish such a scheme. The police also stopped arresting people for carrying the paraphernalia needed to inject drugs.</p> <p>This was a significant shift in approach: the need to stop the transmission of HIV had superseded the need to get people to stop using drugs. Methadone programmes were rolled out across the UK. In December 1986, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Services, Norman Fowler, announced money to bring people into addiction treatment and a nationwide pilot scheme of needle exchange. Harm reduction had come of age.</p> <p>The harm-reduction approach can lead to a virtuous cycle. The establishment of needle and syringe exchanges around the world has led to further opportunities to reduce damage, for example by supplying materials to help with safe injecting. Those injecing heroin usually need to get their hands on some form of acid. Addicts will use any available acid, including household vinegar, to help it dissolve, resulting in highly acidic solutions that are agonising to inject and can cause devastating damage to veins. Citric acid and vitamin C (ascorbic acid), in the right quantity, are now supplied in needle and syringe exchanges.</p> <p>Many exchanges will also supply disposable crack pipes. Cracked lips can bleed, and sharing crack pipes can lead to the transmission of hepatitis C, which is much more infectious than HIV. (In many parts of the UK, roughly half of people injecting drugs have been infected by the virus.)</p> <h2>Policy vs science</h2> <p>Harm reduction has been embraced in many parts of the world &ndash; which is unsurprising, given its alignment with human rights and the strong evidence base. But many countries still have limited access to these strategies. HIV remains a major problem. Fewer than one per cent of people who inject drugs are living in countries that meet the UN&rsquo;s recommendations on coverage for clean needles and access to opioid substitution therapy. In Eastern and Southern Africa, nearly 22 per cent of people who inject drugs are living with HIV. Compare that with England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where about one per cent of people who inject drugs are living with the condition, even though they often have long histories of injecting.</p> <p>But access isn&rsquo;t the only barrier. Attitudes to harm reduction vary around the world, in different countries and cultural contexts, and have waxed and waned over time. Some countries are very relaxed about giving out clean needles and syringes but don&rsquo;t think we should provide crack pipes. Others may be happy to give out crack pipes but will balk at opening drug consumption rooms.</p> <p>We can see what happens when a country takes a generally hostile approach to harm reduction. Russia not only remains resolutely opposed to offering opiate substitution in their own country, they have also used their position at the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs to block harm-reduction policy approaches at the international level. After the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014-15 and its occupation of parts of the Donbas, all harm-reduction services were closed in those areas and opiate substitution therapy was stopped. Obviously, all medical services in Ukraine have been severely impacted by the Russian invasion in February 2022. While some HIV and harm-reduction services have reportedly been re-established in Lviv, the overall effect will be devastating.</p> <p>Methadone has an evidence base that can scarcely be matched by any other medication. It&rsquo;s a long-acting opioid, designed to level out the boom-bust of short-acting heroin. It stops people oscillating wildly between withdrawal and intoxication, bringing stability and the opportunity to break the addiction cycle.</p> <p>However, it straddles &ndash; uncomfortably for some &ndash; a nebulous zone between harm reduction and abstinence. Some people who take it will swiftly stop taking all illicit opiates. For others, it simply reduces the amount of &ldquo;gear&rdquo; they need. Even in those latter cases, though, methadone still reduces the risk of death, of infection and of crime associated with drug use. It has appeared on the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s list of essential medicines since 2005. Yet it may still be one of the most stigmatised medications on the planet. In 2022, there were just 87 countries in the world with at least one programme offering opiate substitution therapy.</p> <h2>In need of a breakthrough</h2> <p>Here in the UK, we have a comprehensive methadone programme. Other substitution therapies are also available, including buprenorphine in various forms. But the vast majority of services now sit outside of the NHS and are provided by third sector organisations in a competitive commissioning model. And while we follow the science on some harm-reduction approaches, we reject others. There is no widespread availability of heroin-assisted treatment, despite the excellent evidence base for this approach. In fact, it was once the basis of the &ldquo;British System&rdquo;, in which heroin was prescribed by doctors up until the 1960s.</p> <p>In some cases, we simply take our time to follow the science. One of the great harm-reduction stories in recent years has been the incredible progress in making naloxone, the &ldquo;Lazarus drug&rdquo;, available to all. Naloxone has been around since the 1960s, but it was only at the turn of the century that pilot schemes in the UK showed its real promise. Given as an injection or a nasal spray it can reverse an opioid overdose, bringing blue breathless bodies back to gasping life. It is given out to people who use drugs to use on each other and to families to save loved ones. In some parts of the UK, the police are now carrying it as well.</p> <p>The harm-reduction philosophy can also be applied to party drugs. Education campaigns on how to safely take drugs like ecstasy or ketamine all fall under the umbrella. A crucial problem with all forms of illicit drug is the lack of standardisation. Dodgy pill factories churning out tablets in makeshift facilities don&rsquo;t have stringent quality control. Charities such as The Loop attend festivals and other events where they check drugs. Festival-goers voluntarily provide samples of the products, such as ecstasy, that they have bought. The Loop then does a chemical analysis of the drug. Warnings can then be issued for dodgy or particularly high-strength batches. In a recent case, chloroquine (best known as an antimalarial drug, very toxic in overdose) was being sold as ketamine.</p> <p>Harm reduction also has a role in legal drugs: &ldquo;no-lo&rdquo; alcohol drinks that reduce overall alcohol intakes fall into harm-reduction policies, as do e-cigarettes. There is still much to learn about vaping from a health perspective, but the current evidence suggests it is less harmful than smoking tobacco by an order of magnitude. The use of condoms is the prime example of where a harm-reduction intervention trumps an irrational and unrealistic insistence on abstinence.</p> <p>Arguably, the biggest harm-reduction intervention would be to decriminalise or to legalise drugs. In a stroke, this would sweep away many of the associated harms. This is, perhaps, the reason why many are opposed to harm reduction, seeing it as decriminalisation by the backdoor. Yet, while many activists advocating for harm-reduction measures may well support decriminalisation policies, the quotidian work of reducing harm is well established, as this piece has described.</p> <p>In some ways, the UK is a success story when it comes to harm reduction. We should recognise and celebrate that we have one of the lowest burdens in the world of HIV infection amongst people who inject drugs. But progress has stalled, even as the death toll from drug use continues to rise.</p> <p>Lessons can be learned from the 1980s, when harm-reduction values were embedded in our current system. That period is an example of what philosopher William MacAskill calls a &ldquo;malleable&rdquo; moment from the past, where a certain plasticity in people&rsquo;s thinking and a willingness to consider a different approach yielded significant results. Activists, healthcare and public health professionals came together with a government that didn&rsquo;t get bogged down in ideological or intellectual cul-de-sacs. It was harm reduction writ large. Since then, some of our thinking has ossified again, but we know that breakthroughs are possible.</p> <p>The UK needs a breakthrough when it comes to drug consumption rooms. The evidence is compelling, the moral imperative in the face of so many deaths irresistible. That&rsquo;s surely why Krykant acted &ndash; his was a practical and compassionate response. Providing a safe place, with access to clean needles and drugs, is an act of simple humanity, offering one of the most stigmatised groups in society some dignity. Professionals and peers can help anyone who &ldquo;goes over&rdquo; and overdoses. They can help reduce drug deaths and the transmission of disease. There is also evidence that drug consumption rooms benefit the wider community, reducing ambulance call-outs and drug litter on the streets. The UK was once a leader in harm reduction. Today, we need to re-model our approach once again, to better our society and reflect the needs of people whose lives depend upon it.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Capture.jpg" height="531" alt="The cover of Cocoon" width="343"></strong></p> <p><strong>Cocoon</strong> (World Editions) by Zhang Yueran, translated by Jeremy Tiang</p> <p>Zhang Yueran is one of China&rsquo;s &ldquo;post-80s&rdquo; writers, also known as the Y generation. Born in 1982 in Jinan, Shandong, in the wake of the Cultural Revolution and the one-child policy, she grew up in the Reform era. This epic novel (which took Zhang seven years to complete) is a stunning evocation of China&rsquo;s recent past and a poignant examination of how events reverberate through the decades.</p> <p>Former friends Li Jiaqi and Cheng Gong meet in their childhood home on the campus of Jinan&rsquo;s medical university. Jiaqi&rsquo;s grandfather, &ldquo;the most famous heart surgeon in China&rdquo;, is dying of lung cancer and she has returned to care for him in his final days. Zhang uses startling imagery in her opening pages to illustrate her protagonist&rsquo;s alienation: &ldquo;I stood by his bed, feeling death hover like a flock of bats.&rdquo;</p> <p>The pair have not met for 18 years and attempt to lay to rest the ghosts that still haunt them. In the course of their conversation, they revisit the family secrets that helped destroy their own hopes and dreams. Their narratives are given equal weight in separate chapters, although Jiaqi&rsquo;s is the more memorable. As they drink through the night and share their stories, old wounds are reopened and emotional scars retraced.</p> <p>Zhang is interested in the psychological fallout of China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution on her generation. Both her characters are neglected by their fathers, who, Zhang suggests, are victims of the harsh times in which they grew up. Their parents&rsquo; disillusionment initially unites the friends but, later, it rips them apart. Zhang writes perceptively about Jiaqi&rsquo;s relationship with her father: her desire to be loved by him; his coldness towards her; her subsequent inability to form lasting attachments. The passages describing his indifference towards his young daughter are heartbreaking.</p> <p>Jiaqi and Gong are surrounded by the vestiges of state oppression, vividly conveyed by their childhood playground &ndash; Dead Man&rsquo;s Tower. Originally constructed as a water tower when the Germans inhabited Jinan, it became the gruesome home for the cadavers and spare organs used in the university&rsquo;s dissection classes and experiments. It&rsquo;s a sinister wasteland, the soil permeated with formaldehyde. Jiaqi swiftly recognises its importance: that &ldquo;anyone who came here would be afraid to commit any crimes, especially capital ones... it wasn&rsquo;t easy to squander your life and not leave behind anything of value&mdash;they could always come and gouge it out of your remains.&rdquo;</p> <p>The central act of violence that drives the narrative takes place in 1967. As hospital manager, Gong&rsquo;s grandfather is denounced by rebels in a &ldquo;struggle session&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s beaten up and left unconscious in the Dead Man&rsquo;s Tower, a brutal attack from which he never fully recovers. Later, the family discover that someone had inserted &ldquo;a two-inch iron nail in his cranial cavity that must have entered through his temple, leaving a scar so small no one had paid it any attention&rdquo;. The nail had rusted, spreading infection through his brain tissue and leaving him in a vegetative state.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s the children&rsquo;s desire to know who committed the crime that leads to their own fracture. As Jiaqi observes: &ldquo;Secrets become secrets and get hidden away because they have the capacity for destruction... It&rsquo;s hard to say what it was that suppressed our childhood creativity, but we couldn&rsquo;t create, only destroy. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because in this country, destruction is always seen as the highest form of creation.&rdquo;</p> <p>Zhang believes &ldquo;the point of literature is to bring us to a deeper level of existence, so we can experience something we never have before.&rdquo; She manages to do just that in this remarkably astute novel, superbly translated by Jeremy Tiang. Her compelling narrative never lets up as she weaves together threads of memory which the reader has to unpick to reveal the truth. Cocoon is a powerful and stark account of intergenerational trauma.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Netradipa Patil has helped create a network of women who are fighting back against widowhood traditions" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/IMG_5358.jpg" height="1447" alt="Netradipa Patil smiles and looks into the camera, her arms folded, wearing a pink and gold sari" width="1448"></p> <p>For years, community healthcare worker Netradipa Patil had been making her rounds in rural Shirol, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. She enquired into people&rsquo;s health and asked how she could be of assistance. One day, she decided to ask an extra question: &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; She noticed that several women didn&rsquo;t even reply. Patil was haunted by their blank stares and silence. What made them feel so low? When she returned soon after, she encouraged these women to speak and spent hours listening to their stories. She discovered they were widows who had been harshly ostracised by their communities.</p> <p>There are more than 55 million widows living in India today. While dealing with the grief and financial loss often caused by losing their husbands, many of these women are pressured into conforming to traditions that have been described as &ldquo;social death&rdquo;. Excluded from festivals and celebrations, many are expected to stay in their homes for a year or longer after the death. These restrictions are accompanied by stigma. In some remote villages, widows are expelled from the community and sent to shelter homes.</p> <p>&ldquo;None of these rituals make any sense,&rdquo; says Patil. But in several parts of India, a woman&rsquo;s identity is still tied to that of her husband. &ldquo;This tradition goes back several centuries and the reason it&rsquo;s followed even today is to curb women&rsquo;s freedom and put restrictions on them.&rdquo; If a widow fails to follow these rituals, she is shamed. People may even accuse her of never having loved her husband.</p> <p>Patil was familiar with these customs, but still she was shocked by the women&rsquo;s stories. &ldquo;It left me numb,&rdquo; she says. One woman was a fellow healthcare worker, Lalita Mudshinge. She was in her early 30s when her husband, a tractor driver, died of a heart attack in 2017. Immediately, she was asked to break her bangles, remove the necklace and vermillion mark associated with married women, and refrain from wearing colourful clothes. Furthermore, she was forbidden from participating in weddings, child naming ceremonies and other celebrations.</p> <p>Mudshinge was prepared for this ostracisation. She also anticipated being blamed for her husband&rsquo;s death, as many widows are. &ldquo;I kept all the medical records safely and even the autopsy report,&rdquo; she says. But despite the evidence that he had died of cardiac arrest, she was still accused by her in-laws and members of the community of playing a part. They also wanted to force her to stay in the house for a year. This was not possible, as Mudshinge, like Patil, worked as a community healthcare worker, which meant regular trips into the centre of the village.</p> <p>&ldquo;The men from the village would stalk me in the streets and make bad comments,&rdquo; she said. The abuse reached a stage where even stepping out of her front door began to feel dangerous. &ldquo;I was so stressed and scared that I often fell ill,&rdquo; she says. The social stigma directly impacted her work, with senior staff yelling at her constantly. &ldquo;Mudshinge was suicidal, depressed, and on the verge of leaving her job,&rdquo; Patil says. However, within a few years, she was helping her fellow widows and battling patriarchal attitudes in her country. How did it happen?</p> <h2>The fight back begins</h2> <p>It all started with that extra question, &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; This simple invitation to speak progressed into hours of conversation, as Mudshinge was finally able to explain her plight. Patil gave Mudshinge her contact details and said to reach out at any time. She also started visiting the woman&rsquo;s home and tried to persuade her in-laws to stop practising the widowhood rituals.</p> <p>Initially, they were not convinced. So, Patil increased the visits. After a few months, Mudshinge began noticing a change. Her in-laws were more accepting of her leaving the house, and even allowed her to wear jewellery and colourful clothes. Men from the community continued to harass her when she did her rounds as a healthcare worker, but after Patil began accompanying her, she found she was more able to face them down.</p> <p>Patil was helping five other widows at the time. They were all coping with challenges, and she felt they were not being adequately supported. So she reached out to a fellow healthcare worker in a nearby village. Together, they began to organise awareness sessions for widows.</p> <p>These healthcare workers understand the plight of widows because they are all women and come from rural communities themselves. They are Accredited Social Health Activists, or ASHA workers. There are over a million ASHAs in India: roughly one for every 1,000 people. They are all female and come from the communities they serve. They do everything from prenatal care to administering vaccines, providing medicines for common ailments and maintaining health records for every community member. <br>Patil started to team up with more ASHA workers, reasoning that widowhood was a serious public health matter and should be treated as such. At first, nobody came to the awareness sessions. They had to squeeze in talking to the widows during routine community visits. Finally, after around six months of this work, with remote counselling done by phone, a few women started showing up to the sessions. &ldquo;It was so powerful,&rdquo; Mudshinge says. &ldquo;It helped me muster the courage to face the stigma.&rdquo;</p> <p>There was still a long way to go, however, when it came to acceptance from the community. That&rsquo;s when Patil came up with a unique idea. She invited all the widows from the nearby villages and asked a local government official to join them for a special event. Patil asked the official to celebrate the widows for their heroism in battling the oppressive widowhood rituals. The official agreed. It was a bold move. News spread in the villages and beyond, and the event was covered by the regional media.</p> <p>Mudshinge printed the photos and kept them in her wallet. &ldquo;From then on, whenever someone abused me, I showed them these photos, and it helped me,&rdquo; she said. She would never have guessed that a photo could change her life. The event expanded into a series, hosted by several villages in Maharashtra. At each event, widows were celebrated and encouraged to break with the rituals and practices that had brought so much suffering into their lives.</p> <p>Around the same time, social activist Pramod Zinjade started a movement asking village heads in Maharashtra to pass a resolution to ban the widowhood rituals outright. In May last year, Herwad became the first village to do so. The state government asked all villages to follow suit, and reportedly 7,500 villages have passed resolutions seeking to curb the practices. However, there are no legal ramifications if these resolutions are not followed through, so it&rsquo;s difficult to say how effective they will be.</p> <h2>Just the beginning</h2> <p>Changing local and state policy is important. But the work doesn&rsquo;t end there. As lawyer and activist Amol Naik says, &ldquo;Implementation is the key.&rdquo; Naik has spent over a decade fighting to protect and uphold the rights of women farmers and agricultural labourers, many of whom suffer greatly if they are faced with widowhood. He points out that widows do have legal rights under Indian law &ndash; such as the right to inherit their husband&rsquo;s property &ndash; but often feel unable to assert these rights. &ldquo;Younger widows are ostracised and made to feel that their relatives are doing them a favour by letting them stay [in their own homes]. Eventually, they stop asking.&rdquo;</p> <p>Akkatai Teli is an activist who has spent four decades working with widows and bringing the perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence to justice. She says that many widows aren&rsquo;t aware of their legal rights and there can often be a vested interest in not telling them. &ldquo;Most of them are denied a share in the property and kicked out of the house because the in-laws fear they will ascertain their rights,&rdquo; she says. Many of these women end up in shelter homes. The problem is so severe that in 2018, the government built a shelter home in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, that can accommodate 1,000 widows.</p> <p>Patil, meanwhile, has continued to work on the root cause of widows&rsquo; problems. Between 2017 and 2022 she trained a team of 20 women, most of whom are widows themselves, to help combat regressive customs. So far, the network has helped hundreds of widows from over 20 villages in Maharashtra. Her attempts are now being formalised into a full-time support system at the village, district and state levels.</p> <p>Patil&rsquo;s goal is not just to help these women heal, but to ensure they can live a life of dignity. This involves practical support; ensuring the widows have the correct paperwork to access government welfare, training them to become self-reliant and helping them start their own businesses. She also helps them access mental health treatment. &ldquo;Telling their stories can be triggering for the women,&rdquo; she says, so they have learned to be careful in their work.</p> <p>But there is another challenge. As an ASHA, Patil isn&rsquo;t paid for her work with the widows, nor is she trained to provide counselling. &ldquo;The health department doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge our work,&rdquo; she says. The work with widows is classed as voluntary. She says that ASHAs aren&rsquo;t paid enough in any case, and could achieve much more with adequate compensation.</p> <p>While the exact figures vary across states, they are uniformly low. In Maharashtra, ASHAs earn an average of 3,500-5,000 Indian Rupees (&pound;34-50) per month. They are paid per task &ndash; for example, for providing antenatal or postnatal care and overseeing a pregnancy in a public hospital, they earn &pound;4.90. &ldquo;ASHAs are a support system for millions of people,&rdquo; Patil points out. &ldquo;If the government starts paying us adequately and on time, many [more] ASHAs can help women recover from their trauma.&rdquo;</p> <h2>A turning point</h2> <p>Ongoing support is important, as even if the lives of widows improve, they still have to recover from the abuse and ostracisation. When Anjali Pehelwan, 39, lost her husband to Covid, her relatives weren&rsquo;t concerned about her grief. &ldquo;All they wanted was to forcefully take away my jewellery and toe rings,&rdquo; she remembers. Although Pehelwan resisted, a few women pulled off her jewellery, bruising and cutting her. The cuts healed in a week, she says, but it took a year before she recovered from the mental trauma.</p> <p>Luckily, Pehelwan was able to access support. She was put in touch with Maya Patil, the ASHA worker who had helped Netradipa organise the very first awareness sessions for widows. (Netradipa and Maya share a last name but are not related.) Maya Patil started counselling Pehelwan on the phone and in person. Gradually, Pehelwan started wearing her jewellery again, began to leave the house, and started asking people to treat her as an equal to other women. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. &ldquo;The community members were so aghast that they started calling me ill-omened and a witch,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>Then, in April 2022, Maya Patil came up with the idea of celebrating Gudi Padwa (Maharashtra&rsquo;s new year), considered to be the most auspicious occasion in the Hindu calendar. &ldquo;Traditionally, while a widow is allowed to celebrate this occasion, they are barred from performing any rituals,&rdquo; Pehelwan explains. Maya Patil was determined to change this. She called a group of 20 women together, including Pehelwan and another widow. &ldquo;I started talking about the discriminatory practices and why we should raise our voice,&rdquo; she says. At first, the other women stepped away from the widows, but Patil wouldn&rsquo;t give up. She convinced them to celebrate the new year festival together, with Pehelwan taking the lead.</p> <p>There was a backlash from certain members of the community. People spread a rumour that Pehelwan was celebrating the festival because she had remarried. (Widows in India are allowed to remarry, but in reality they are often ostracised if they do.) A scandal was brewing, but fortunately the local journalists reported the event accurately, confirming that Pehelwan was still single. &ldquo;That was the best time to shut down all such conspiracy theories,&rdquo; she recalls, laughing at the memory.</p> <p>Later, Pehelwan discovered that there were 450 widows and separated women in her village of Arjunwad alone. &ldquo;We need to stop using the word &lsquo;widow&rsquo; and come up with better words,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;&lsquo;Widow&rsquo; is never a woman&rsquo;s identity. It&rsquo;s no fault of hers that her husband has died.&rdquo; She found that many women wanted to oppose the rituals, but didn&rsquo;t speak up because of the patriarchal system. &ldquo;My goal is to help them voice their concerns.&rdquo;</p> <p>Pehelwan works long hours as a data entry operator. But although her work is tiring, she spends her evenings taking phone calls from other widows, encouraging them to leave the house and assert their rights. &ldquo;People think it&rsquo;s a burden, but it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Whenever I see a woman healing, I feel I have given someone a new life. While this can never make up for my loss, I am proud to help bring an end to the trauma of other women.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Robert Pirsig's 1974 bestseller continues to serve as a gospel for long-distance bikers" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/iswanto-arif-m1nHYuMvBAI-unsplash-small.jpg" height="1448" alt="A man on a motorbike in the mountains" width="1448"></p> <p>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, published in 1974, was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon. A work of fictionalised autobiography, the book follows its author Robert Pirsig on a long motorcycle ride through the US, from Minnesota across the prairie to Oregon, then down to southern California. The muscles of that skeletal journey are Pirsig&rsquo;s philosophical musings on the notion of Quality. Pirsig created the concept in order explain the relationship between human values and societal values.</p> <p>At once both obvious and ephemeral, Quality escapes easy definition. (And brings to mind American supreme court justice Potter Stewart&rsquo;s comments about pornography: &ldquo;I know it when I see it.&rdquo;) In his original formulation, Pirsig describes it, not a little paradoxically, as &ldquo;a characteristic of thought and statement that is recognised by a non-thinking or intuitive process.&rdquo; At another juncture, Quality is defined as the event which occurs between the observer and the observed. Pirsig&rsquo;s search for clarity stretched his mind to the breaking point, ultimately landing him in a psychiatric facility where he was subjected to electroshock therapy.</p> <p>And yet, the concept has been influential. The book, a bestseller, continues to be read by motorcyclists, philosophers and everyone in between. This year, a long-awaited collection of writings has been published for the first time, giving us a deeper look at how Pirsig shaped his concept. Edited by Pirsig&rsquo;s widow Wendy, an archivist and Pirsig&rsquo;s frequent collaborator, On Quality uses outtakes from unpublished letters and lectures, and from Pirsig&rsquo;s two books (Zen and 1991&rsquo;s Lila). It is an intimate and highly selective look at his journey through the work of the early Greek philosophers, Asiatic mysticism and beyond.</p> <p>Again and again, he approaches the concept from different angles, employing simile, analogy and deductive reasoning. Often, he only tightens the knot he has created. But there are moments of brilliance. In a letter written in 1995, Pirsig outlined where he saw Quality fitting among the pantheon of religious philosophy, placing it beside Hinduism&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oneness&rdquo; Buddhism&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nothingness&rdquo; and the monotheist&rsquo;s &ldquo;God&rdquo; as a fourth path leading up &ldquo;the mountain of understanding&rdquo;. Optimistically, he singles out Quality as the one that cannot be dismissed by the &ldquo;scientifically minded&rdquo; as &ldquo;meaningless, metaphysical claptrap&rdquo;.</p> <p>Quality then, is a kind of religion, though one preaching improvement for its own sake, rather than in the service of some deity. It is less concerned with eternal life than with the pursuit of truth and beauty. Much of its appeal lies in Pirsig&rsquo;s prose, which combines his repetitive, mantra-like style with a pragmatic, matter-of-fact charm. The book is illustrated with photos of his collection of tools &ndash; spanners, drills, pliers and the like &ndash; a reminder that this was a philosopher with dirt under his fingernails.</p> <h2>The goal of truth</h2> <p>I first read Pirsig in 2012, while preparing for my own long motorcycle journey, from the Canadian prairie to the Argentinian Pampa. It strikes me now as a voyage from one cattle country to another, though at that time it was too sinuous and ill-planned to be so clearly defined. I had none of Pirsig&rsquo;s discipline, but like him, I struggled to find meaning in what I was pursuing. Was I travelling as catharsis? For freedom? For evasion? Adventure seemed the most likely reason, but I was too often alone and inconsolable to convince myself of that pursuit.</p> <p>If Quality is the quasi-religion of what Pirsig called the &ldquo;Church of Reason&rdquo;, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is its holy book. I wasn&rsquo;t the only one to treat it as such. Motorcyclists I met on that trip, and have met since, talk about Zen as a kind of compendium for life. Like most adherents, there was among them more enthusiasm (which means, as Pirsig points out, &ldquo;filled with theos&rdquo;, or God) for Pirsig than drive for understanding.</p> <p>When Zen was first published, motorcycle travel literature was not yet the identifiable genre it is today. That variety of travelogue began in earnest in 1979 with the appearance of Ted Simon&rsquo;s Jupiter&rsquo;s Travels, the story of a five-year round-the-world odyssey between 1973 and 1977. If Pirsig was a kind of modern Homer, Simon was like Virgil: pagan and worldly, inured in scholarship of prose, yet beset with laurels of deism. &ldquo;Of all the gods in the pantheon,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;Jupiter is the one I fancy most. A lovely name, Jupiter, like cream and honey in the mouth. And a sense of great distance and closeness at the same time.&rdquo;</p> <p>Compare that to Pirsig, who wrote in Zen that &ldquo;The primary goal of the Church of Reason... is always Socrates&rsquo; old goal of truth, in its ever-changing forms, as it&rsquo;s revealed by the process of rationality.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s easy to see why motorcyclists might choose the path of Simon&rsquo;s self-aggrandisement over Pirsig&rsquo;s &ldquo;goal of truth&rdquo;. There was always the temptation to play at being god. While my own pan-American odyssey was underway, I came to recognise a particular mindset in fellow riders: an air of being separate in space and time, of being out of reality and untouchable. There were plenty of vengeful Odins and chaotic brothers of Mars riding into town with conquering on their minds. My own choice of god at the time was the callous and boozy Dionysus.</p> <p>Unambiguously foreign, strangely dressed, noisy, incorrigible, we rode our machines across the world as though it were the plains of Troy. We were given beds, food and love &ndash; offerings we accepted as tributes for our appearance on the battlefield. When we left, it was not uncommon for crowds of people to appear to see us off. The effect was inebriating, nectar for the ego. Today, those events put me in mind of Patrick Kavanagh&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Epic&rdquo;, which ends with the lines: &ldquo;Till Homer&rsquo;s ghost came whispering to my mind. / He said: I made the Iliad from such / A local row. Gods make their own importance.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Wreaking havoc</h2> <p>But therein lies the trouble with gods &ndash; they do not go out into the world to learn, but to teach, to wreak havoc, have their way with mortals; they live in the world as they want it, rather than as it is. Passing through one country after another, often without our &ldquo;required&rdquo; documents, and with the freedom of our vehicles, we felt that we had passed beyond the rules of society. I rode all over the Americas illegally, my expired paperwork needing only a few flicks of my pen to change the date.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand why travelers feel out of step with the world around them. Society is largely based on repetition and reliability, neither of which travel provides. But enough time ignoring the rules and a detached superiority begins to settle in. And then, the worst: bored with the thrills offered by the natural world, by spontaneity, by socialising, such riders turn from life to arithmetic: tallying up miles ridden, countries entered, tyres blown, meals eaten. Quantity becomes synonymous with merit, and the most venerable are those who have &ldquo;done more&rdquo;. As the urge to quantify rises, Quality suffers.</p> <p>Simon ends Jupiter&rsquo;s Travels with this reflection: &ldquo;Often I dream of riding over the hard red floor of a great forest, beneath a high canopy of translucent green, spreading on and on. An enchanted forest, perhaps, where men may still sometimes play at being gods.&rdquo; Pirsig ends Zen in a very different manner, by saying that &ldquo;to understand Quality, he would have to leave the mythos.&rdquo; It continues: &ldquo;[he] emerges as if from a dream, seeing that his whole consciousness, the mythos, has been a dream and no one&rsquo;s dream but his own, a dream he must now sustain of his own efforts.&rdquo;</p> <p>There is much to admire in motorcycle writing, but too much of it today is a poor imitation of the genre&rsquo;s forefathers. We will not produce another writer like Robert Pirsig until we can differentiate quantity from Quality. And we have to stop playing at being gods.</p> <p><em><span class="Apple-converted-space">This article is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here.</a></span></em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>
