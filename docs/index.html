<hr />
<p>Hey, friends &#8212;<br />
Today I thought I&#8217;d talk about an unfortunate paper, one that was published several weeks ago and that I was reluctant to contribute to its promotion. I waited quietly &#8212; I was busy anyway &#8212; to see what would happen to it, and aside from an early flurry of attempts at self-promotion by its authors and fellow travelers, it seems to have fallen into the obscurity it deserves. It&#8217;s safe for me to tear into it, then!</p>
<p>The paper is titled &#8220;In Defense of Merit in Science&#8221;, published in something called the Journal of Controversial Ideas. I had no idea that merit needed defending, or was at all controversial, but it has 29 authors, some of whom have significant prestige. Others are nothing but Intellectual Dark Web sort of cranks, and all of them would be not at all out of place on the fake University of Austin faculty. It&#8217;s an expansion of the Grievance Studies nonsense, and Boghossian is one of the authors, while Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay are cited, and if authors are not on the staff of the University of Austin, at least some of them are publishing opinion pieces in Quillette. Basically, it&#8217;s a collection of right-wing ideologues complaining about ideology, unaware that it&#8217;s ideology all the way down.</p>
<p>The primary author is a chemist from USC named Anna Krylov, so I&#8217;m going to refer to it as the Krylov paper, even though it has a swarm of hangers-on all listed in alphabetical order as a testimonial to their agreement with its thesis. They really all should be equally embarrassed.</p>
<p>To make it manageable, I&#8217;ve broken up this video into three pieces. First I&#8217;ll just take a look at the claims of the paper &#8212; is it true that the Social Justice Warriors are taking over and destroying science? Secondly, I&#8217;ll offer my personal perspective as a social justice advocate and professor at a liberal arts school. Are we actually trying to oppose Western science and the principle of merit? And finally, I&#8217;ll get a bit meta and ask, is the paper &#8220;In Defense of Merit in Science&#8221; actually meritorious by any objective criteria?</p>
<p>RESENTMENT AND LIES</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the paper. The abstract has a few problems.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Merit is a central pillar of liberal epistemology, humanism, and democracy. The scientific enterprise, built on merit, has proven effective in generating scientific and technological advances, reducing suffering, narrowing social gaps, and improving the quality of life globally. This perspective documents the ongoing attempts to undermine the core principles of liberal epistemology and to replace merit with non­scientific, politically motivated criteria. We explain the philosophical origins of this conflict [they don&#8217;t],  document the intrusion of ideology into our scientific institutions [they don&#8217;t], discuss the perils of abandoning merit [no one has suggested abandoning merit], and offer an alternative, human­-centered approach to address existing social inequalities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first big problem, and one that plagues the whole paper, is that merit isn&#8217;t actually defined, nor do they discuss how we should recognize and measure merit, which is the crux of the issue. More serious people recognize that measuring merit is complex and difficult. Their whole argument is a kind of naive utilitarianism &#8212; if something generates scientific advances and reduces suffering, then it has by definition, merit. There is and will be no consideration of conflicts in those goals: sometimes technological advances will increase social gaps or reduce the quality of life for at least some people. If science and technology make a small proportion of the population incredibly wealthy at the cost of impoverishing everyone else, is that &#8220;merit&#8221;? The calculus isn&#8217;t as simple as they think.</p>
<p>The second big problem is their biased mischaracterization of anyone who disagrees with their simplistic argument. You see, if you point out the internal conflicts with their ideas, and suggest different priorities for society, then you want &#8220;to replace merit with non­scientific, politically motivated criteria.&#8221; There is no middle ground. You either agree with their priorities whole-heartedly, or you hate merit and science and democracy, and want to reduce our quality of life. Have they considered the possibility that people may have different ideals and value other approaches to improving the world? That balance is also a consideration?</p>
<p>The introduction does not improve on the abstract, having the same glib superficiality. It&#8217;s the kind of thing where you think for a moment that it sounds good &#8212; of course I value science, and merit, and making people happy and safe &#8212; but when you think about it, you realize that they&#8217;ve resolved nothing and are just spitting out buzzwords.</p>
<p>For instance, it starts with a volley of Pinkerisms &#8212; it literally cites Steven Pinker for this stuff &#8212; that this is the best of all worlds, that we&#8217;ve improved everything since ancient times, you must be grateful that you were born in this time and place, that we are living in a more just and peaceful world, thanks to scientific progress. It&#8217;s safe to write that, since a Bangladeshi garment worker, or a Russian soldier in Ukraine, or a trans teenager in Missouri, or an immigrant working in a slaughterhouse, are unlikely to read the paper and object.</p>
<p>They acknowledge this inequity, at least. It&#8217;s just that they respond with rank scientism and a remarkable obliviousness.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, serious problems continue to challenge us; poverty, inequality, wars, and violence persist. Climate change, biodiversity loss, antimicrobial resistance, and pandemic disease threaten global gains made over the past century. However, science continues to be the best tool humanity possesses to address these complex, collective challenges. Indeed, science holds the key to solving these problems—it provides the basis for renewable energy technologies, mitigating anthropogenic impact on the global climate, feeding the world’s growing population, controlling pandemics, and eradicating debilitating diseases.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Science continues to be the best tool&#8221; &#8212; but in many cases it isn&#8217;t. The best tools are often sociological. If we want to reduce global climate change, we aren&#8217;t going to science our way out of it &#8212; we need to change our consumption habits, we have to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels, we need to eat less red meat, we have to stop stripping the ocean floor of sea life. Technology is part of the solution, but not the whole of it.</p>
<p>Then to bring up the eradication of diseases…we recently went through this, remember? Millions died. Developing a vaccine was essential, but so many people refused to accept basic behavioral changes, like masking, and many still refuse to take advantage of that scientific solution, the vaccine. Again, it&#8217;s not as simple as they want you to believe.</p>
<p>They make a token acknowledgment of that fact.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, science alone is not sufficient: science is but a tool that can be used for good and bad. It is our responsibility as a society to use it responsibly, ethically, and effectively.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa. So ethics matters? We&#8217;re bringing philosophy into this now? We&#8217;re supposed to be defending scientific merit, which we&#8217;re pretending is some quantifiable metric we can apply to the solution for any problem, but now we have to incorporate values into it? Sounds like those fuzzy social justice concerns might have some relevance after all.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, though, it&#8217;s only a momentary flash of introspection, quickly cast aside as they identify the true enemies of reason and science and merit. It&#8217;s identity politics.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fulfilling this responsibility, however, is being hindered by a new, alarming clash between liberal epistemology and identity­ based ideologies. Liberal epistemology prizes free and open inquiry, values vigorous discourse and debate, and determines the best scientific ideas by separating those that are true from those that are likely not. The statuses, identities, and demographics of scientists are irrelevant to this great sifting of valid versus invalid ideas.</p></blockquote>
<p>I love the idea that statuses, identities, and demographics shouldn&#8217;t matter. Unfortunately, that horse got out of the barn long ago, and it&#8217;s convenient that now, long after statuses, identities, and demographics have established dominion over the sciences, we&#8217;re going to turn a blind eye to long established biases. The sifting often doesn&#8217;t happen, with extant scientists deciding that we shouldn&#8217;t disturb the status quo by bringing up how often invalid ideas have been accepted.</p>
<p>Case in point: Anna Krylov and her cronies. It&#8217;s a bad sign when your defense of unbiased, valid ideas has to resort to bogus canards to make your point, but that&#8217;s exactly what this paper does. For example…</p>
<blockquote><p>Although there are feminist critiques of how glaciologists have conducted themselves, there is no such thing as “feminist glaciology,” just as there is no “queer chemistry,” “Jewish physics,” “white mathematics,” “indigenous science,” or “feminist astronomy.” Glacial, physical, genetic, or prehistoric phenomena are independent of the positionality of the scientist. By prioritizing the truth value of scientific research, personal influences of individual scientists are minimized.</p></blockquote>
<p>But of course there is a feminist glaciology! These people clearly haven&#8217;t read the paper they are criticizing, since it does make a valid point. I&#8217;ll quote <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/qa-author-feminist-glaciology-study-reflects-sudden-appearance-culture-wars">Mark Carey</a>, one of the authors, who had to defend his work in the journal Science because so many ill-informed yahoos were raising a ruckus about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>If one goal of glacier research is to help the people living in places like the Alps and Alaska adapt to shrinking glaciers—and the associated floods, landslides, and seasonal variation in water flows for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation—then it is important to study more than the physical properties of ice. Social scientists like myself work to understand those complex societies, their politics and economies, their cultures, and, yes, their gender relations because patriarchy and sexism marginalize certain segments of the population, just as racism marginalizes indigenous, Latino, and other peoples.</p>
<p>Our paper argues that social science and humanities research can contribute to the development of appropriate strategies for specific and diverse societies to adapt to change. A woman&#8217;s experience securing postdisaster aid, rebuilding a home, and raising a family after a glacial lake outburst flood has destroyed her community is different than those of men. And for glaciologist Erin Pettit, the founder of the Girls on Ice program for young women to study glaciology, there is something productive and empowering that happens when high school girls learn science and conduct field research in an environment without boys.</p></blockquote>
<p>I remind you that the authors of the Krylov paper said, &#8220;science alone is not sufficient: science is but a tool that can be used for good and bad.&#8221; The experiences of the people and communities who live in the shadow of glaciers are prioritizing a significant aspect of the truth; it&#8217;s the team of resentful ideologues who want to hide the complexity of the issues, and resort to the mantra of &#8220;ice is ice&#8221; and turn glaciology into nothing but a physics problem. It is, in significant part, but the whole is much greater.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t seem to be able to read anything on these subjects with comprehension. One of their frequent claims is that a goal of Critical Social Justice (CSJ) is to destroy everything, not just science, but art and law. You don&#8217;t believe me? They make this claim multiple times in the paper.</p>
<blockquote><p>The CSJ view—that institutions of knowledge, art, and law perpetuate systemic racism and, therefore, must be dismantled, and that merit ­based criteria in hiring, publishing, and funding must be replaced with CSJ criteria—has been aggressively advanced by many of our academic leadership—university administrators, executive bodies of professional societies, publishers, etc. A search for “racism” in the titles of papers published by the Science and Nature Publishing groups returns hundreds of hits such as “NIH Apologizes for ‘Structural Racism,’ Pledges Change,”73 “Dismantling Systemic Racism in Science,” 74 and “Systemic Racism in Higher Education.” This reflects the axiomatic ideological perspective of CSJ that systemic racism is indelibly etched into every Western institution. The perspective is taken as an article of faith, which is why some have argued that CSJ is more a secular religion than an evidence­ based science.</p></blockquote>
<p>Something that jumped out at me is that you may notice that this claim that CSJ wants to &#8220;dismantle&#8221; institutions of knowledge is unreferenced. I would at least expect a quote from some radical social justice weirdo that they aim to take all of science apart, but they don&#8217;t have it. Instead, they dig up criticisms of racism in the titles of papers in prominent journals. This is how they justify that claim, by discovering that many scientists study and oppose racism? Is racism one of the scientific truths that they believe have merit? Are we to seriously believe that Science magazine, Nature magazine, and the National Institutes of Health, some of the biggest scientific institutions in the world, are arguing that they should dismantle themselves? This is rank nonsense. And, as we&#8217;ll see, they have to distort and lie about the contents of the papers that they do cite to make their case.</p>
<p>They do this repeatedly. Science…it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/giaahdbacj">infected by the humanities</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>For decades, Critical Theories had been confined to humanities and Studies departments of universities. But the ideas have spread to other disciplines and the outside world, where they have been picked up by activists and the press. Following the canons of CSJ, science is described as “white” and “colonial” and, therefore, should be dismantled. These ideas now routinely appear in some of the most influential scientific journals without citation to actual data supporting their claims. The apex journal Nature has created a “Decolonizing Science Toolkit,”89 which includes articles such as “Institutions Must Acknowledge the Racist Roots in Science,”90 “Decolonization Should Extend to Collaborations, Authorship and Co­Creation of Knowledge,”91 and “Seeding an Anti­Racist Culture at Scotland’s Botanical Gardens.”92</p></blockquote>
<p>See the pattern? First claim that CSJ is about dismantling science, and follow up with a flurry of titles of science articles that mention racism and colonialism as if that&#8217;s sufficient to demonstrate the point.</p>
<p>Again, I must ask &#8212; where are these &#8220;canons of CSJ&#8221; claiming that &#8220;science…should be dismantled&#8221;? They aren&#8217;t listed in the references at the end of the paper. Instead, we get a collection of papers from the journal Nature &#8212; which, I promise you, isn&#8217;t planning to deconstruct itself anytime in the foreseeable future &#8212; that talk about the historical racism that is unquestionably present in science, that argues that colonial exploitation of indigenous peoples existed and continues to exist, and that the botanical collections in British museums were the result of unacknowledged contributions from talented native peoples.</p>
<p>Tell me…what is wrong with that? The paper sure doesn&#8217;t explain. It&#8217;s just paranoia and indignant histrionics about how including historical context does great harm to science, somehow. Reading this paper overall gives the impression that they really, really want everyone to shut up about racism, we should sweep it under the rug, we need to pretend that history and culture have never ever influenced science. Colonialism is good, don&#8217;t you know.</p>
<p>One other small point: they constantly refer to social justice as &#8220;CSJ,&#8221; or Critical Social Justice. This is a conceit that seems to have been popularized by the grievance study people &#8212; they noticed that the term Critical Race Theory was effectively demonized by right-wing propaganda, so sure, let&#8217;s stick the word &#8220;Critical&#8221; in front of everything we don&#8217;t like. It&#8217;s mildly annoying.</p>
<p>I could go through this paper paragraph by paragraph and see the biases exposed, but in the interest of giving their argument a fair shake, I&#8217;m going to skip ahead to a whole section on page 16 in which they make a somewhat more specific claim, that CSJs think &#8220;Merit­ based policies should be replaced by identity­ based policies.&#8221; They don&#8217;t actually support that idea. At best, they can argue that identity should be one factor, in addition to merit, in rewarding scientific contributions.</p>
<p>So Krylov and others say</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Major scientific journals such as Nature, Science, and their sister publications regularly publish opinions, editorials, and letters to the editor calling for increasing the number of women and selected minorities among tenure­ track faculty, graduate students, award recipients, conference speakers, and editorial boards. In response, scientific institutions have begun implementing identity ­based practices and social engineering. 52,62,107,108</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="creationist">
<p>Some faculty hiring committees are prioritizing diversity over merit or even using ideology as a filter by, for example, eliminating candidates solely based on DEI statements.47,48,51</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually true, in part! We do want to foster diversity, but no, it doesn&#8217;t override merit and quality of faculty. For example, when we at my university are doing a job search, we include this little bit of boilerplate in our ads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Morris values diversity in its students, faculty, and staff. Morris is especially interested in qualified candidates who can contribute to the diversity of our community through their teaching, research, and /or service because we believe that diversity enriches the University experience for everyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>We also have members of our search committees go through training to recognize implicit bias. When we are reviewing applications, our choices are subject to review by the administration: did our final candidates reflect the distribution of applicants in the pool? We have a whole bunch of science-based procedures to prevent our biases from influencing our selection of the best people for the job.</p>
<p>We also expect diversity, equity, and inclusion statements, because faculty at our university (but perhaps not at the University of Austin) are expected to work collegially with diverse colleagues and students. We might even eliminate candidates solely based on their DEI statements: we would not be able to assess them if they didn&#8217;t write one, and if their statement was something along the lines of &#8220;We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children,&#8221; then yeah, we&#8217;re not going to hire them.  Do they think we ought to employ white nationalists or something?</p>
<p>I think the answer would be yes, because there&#8217;s also a subtext here that has to be addressed. Here&#8217;s an example: they dislike affirmative action, among many other things, but don&#8217;t really make a good argument against it.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Some form of affirmative action might be effective in college admissions, when students do not yet possess demonstrated credentials and many have lacked educational opportunities. However, when preferential selection goes overboard, e.g., when the mean scores on admission criteria of affirmative action students is a standard deviation (or more) below those of students admitted under conventional standards, the practice becomes counterproductive in helping underrepresented groups to advance.131</p></blockquote>
<p>The important bit in that paragraph is the claim that it&#8217;s problematic when we let in affirmative action students, that is, minorities, with scores that are a standard deviation below those of other students. I would argue that admission criteria aren&#8217;t the rock solid scientific metrics you might imagine them to be, and are also subject to historical and cultural biases, but OK, let&#8217;s see the evidence. There&#8217;s that citation #131, which I assumed would be an example of low-scoring minority students getting in where they don&#8217;t deserve, but surprise, surprise. It&#8217;s from an article titled &#8220;An American Crisis: the Lack of Black Men in Medicine,&#8221; in the  Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40615-017-0380-y">Here&#8217;s what it says</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>We conducted an analysis of American Association of Medical Colleges applicant and matriculation data. Our analysis compared the 1992–1993 GPA scores of white males to the 2013–2014 GPA scores of Black males. The results indicated there that there were no significant differences in GPA scores of Black males in 2013–2014 compared to white males’ GPA scores decades before. </p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa! It doesn&#8217;t support the claims of the Krylov paper at all!</p>
<p>This is the kind of behavior I&#8217;d expect from a creationist &#8212; they&#8217;re comfortable with mangling a scientific conclusion to say the opposite of what the author intended. But these are supposedly competent mainstream scientists, outright misrepresenting the ideas of the papers they cite.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve made my case: this is a bad paper, full of vaguely defined terms, poorly supported claims, and dishonest distortions of the evidence. It should be an embarrasment to the authors, but since it feeds on and supports their twin motivations of resentment and entitlement, they&#8217;re not going to apply any kind of critical faculties to their work.</p>
<p>But who am I to criticize? I&#8217;m one of the social justice warriors they despise, employed as a professor at exactly the kind of university they hate. I freely admit to my position.</p>
<p>TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION</p>
<p>I am a professor at the University of Minnesota Morris, a public liberal arts college with a reputation for being relatively diverse and tolerant. Almost 20% of our student body are native Americans, and I specifically applied to work here because it was a student-centered university with a real appreciation for the breadth of knowledge. I believe in the importance of the humanities and social sciences and arts, in addition to the sciences, as an essential recipe for a good education. It&#8217;s a great place to work and is highly appreciated by a majority of our graduates.</p>
<p>You might be wondering how we must suffer for having to dance to the tune of Critical Social Justice, and how dreadfully denigrated the concepts of Western science must be here, and how savagely we must downplay merit in job applications, and tenure and promotion decisions. At least, if you&#8217;d read the nonsense in that Krylov paper you might think that.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what life really is like living under the thumb of a liberal social justice campus.</p>
<p>We are requested to include a land acknowledgement in our syllabi and our professional presentations, and the administration even includes boilerplate text that we can use. Note the word &#8220;request&#8221;: we are not required to do so, and most of us are more than willing to express our debt to the Dakota peoples. This is something of a minimal, token nod in their direction, so you&#8217;d have to be exceptionally mean-spirited to complain about it. The Krylov gang complains about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>By offering this land acknowledgment, we affirm tribal sovereignty and express respect for Native peoples and nations. The University of Minnesota Morris is located along Owobopte Wakpa—a place from which Dakota turnips have been dug river—on the edge of mashkode akiing—prairie land. This land has been cared for and called home by the Dakota people, and later the Ojibwe people and other Native peoples, from time immemorial. Our state’s name, Minnesota, comes from the Dakota name for this region, Mni Sota Makoce—the land where the waters reflect the skies. Acknowledging the land and our history in this place is an offering of solidarity with and respect for Native nations and peoples. In doing so, we—The University of Minnesota Morris—reaffirm our commitment to our responsibilities rooted in the history of our campus site as a Native American boarding school, our distinctive mission as a public liberal arts college within Minnesota’s land-grant university, and our federal recognition as a Native American-Serving Nontribal Institution.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of history imbedded in that statement, and part of being here is an awareness of what it all means. Yes, this place was founded as an Indian boarding school by the Catholic church. I suppose it&#8217;s a burden that we aren&#8217;t allowed to forget that, but it&#8217;s part of the truth. It wouldn&#8217;t be meritorious to neglect our history. One of the buildings of that school still stands on campus.</p>
<p>We are a land-grant college. What that means is that we are a beneficiary of the Morrill act, a 19th century law that gave railroad tycoons an incentive to build rails across the wilderness, in return for giving them vast tracts of land all across the American west. They also had to set aside a fraction of that to the state, which could use the revenues to fund educational institutions. This land was taken away from the native people, and then, curiously, the government gave it away freely to European immigrants.</p>
<p>We are a colonial institution built on the bones of the people who came before us. We have to recognize this. The funding of our college was derived from land confiscated from the Dakota people in the mid 19th century, which led to them being confined to small reservations, forcing them to give up their way of life to become farmers, kidnapping their children and sending them to boarding schools like ours, and making them reliant on the non-existent generosity of US Indian Agents. Famine triggered the Dakota War of 1862, a bloody and brutal conflict on both sides.</p>
<p>The United States of America is a profoundly racist country. It hurts to admit this, but part of the merit of science ought to be an ability to witness uncomfortable truths, and make amends. The Dakota War ended with the defeat of the tribes at the hands of the US Army, and then we got the largest mass execution in the US, with 38 Indians hanged at a giant gallows. Isn&#8217;t technology wonderful? The bodies of the dead were then used for medical study. The Dakota leader, Little Crow, was shot by a farmer later. His body was scalped, and the scalp sent off to the Smithsonian Institution. His head was chopped off and paraded around the town of Hutchinson before being sent off to the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>
<p>Science was not an innocent bystander. The butchered remains of the Indian dead were not returned for burial until the 1970s.</p>
<p>This is not ancient history, either. The University of Minnesota continues to profit from the resources taken from indigenous peoples, and you can read more about it in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/truthproject/home?authuser=0">Truth Project</a>, a study made to examine the relationship between the university and the tribes of Minnesota, which found &#8220;persistent, systemic mistreatment of Indigenous peoples by the University of Minnesota.&#8221;</p>
<p>The price of being a CSJ is fairly minimal: land acknowledgments, campus signs in both English and Anishinaabe, tuition waivers for all American Indian students (given that I think all students ought to be tuition exempt, that&#8217;s not any cost at all), the idea that we should respect our students&#8217; cultures, no matter where they&#8217;re from, and awareness of the tragedy of our ancestor&#8217;s colonialist confiscation of the land. I&#8217;m more than willing to pay that.</p>
<p>To the authors of the &#8220;merit&#8221; paper, this is not only too much, but that anyone who recognizes that history and the trauma of racism is faking it. Here&#8217;s one of the authors, McWhorter, exhibiting extreme insensitivity:</p>
<blockquote><p>The notion seems to be that practitioners and scholars, across disciplines, must devote a considerable part of their time to putatively antiracist initiatives. It’s a bold proposition, but given how shaky its actual justification is, it is reasonable to think that lately this devotion is being imposed by fiat, as opposed to being an organic outpouring. And if the price for questioning that notion is to be seen as sitting somewhere on a spectrum ranging from retrogressive to racist, it’s a price few are willing to pay. One is, rather, to pretend.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess anti-racists can&#8217;t possibly be sincere. Truth is, we don&#8217;t devote as much time as the subject deserves to anti-racism. I teach genetics, a subject with a long history of deplorable biases, and I spent one week of the semester on why racist genetics is wrong &#8212; time which was also spent applying what they learned about the actual science of genetics to racist pseudoscience. None of this was imposed by fiat. There is no university requirement that every class must include an obligatory session of racism bashing, so yes, it was organic and voluntary. The idea that anyone who disagrees with your right-wing ideology is just pretending is grossly offensive, and says more about McWhorter&#8217;s beliefs than anything about me. Oh, you can&#8217;t imagine someone being honestly anti-racist? Then screw you, McWhorter.</p>
<p>One other thing: the idea that being on the CSJ side means you&#8217;re anti-merit. That&#8217;s bullshit. I still get yearly performance reviews where I&#8217;m asked about my teaching, my research, my service to the university, and I have to submit these forms summarizing my work to date. Nowhere on these forms is there a question about my identity (it&#8217;s reduced to my social security number, if you must know), and nowhere is any administrator looking at me and saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re white, no raise for you this year.&#8221; I still give grades, but they&#8217;re based on performance, not skin color. No one in this very liberal university is even suggesting that we stop assessment, even though that&#8217;s a word that terrifies every professor, because it involves paperwork.</p>
<p>WHERE&#8217;S THE MERIT?</p>
<p>The &#8220;merit&#8221; paper had a struggle getting published, and was rejected by many editors, the authors claim. Now most of us, if we were trying to publish and editors kept bouncing it back at us and telling us that it was unacceptable, might stop and think that maybe the problem was ourselves, not the editors. That&#8217;s the whole point of publishing, isn&#8217;t it? To get feedback from your peers about the quality of the work?</p>
<p>Not to these clowns. They got rejected ONCE, by PNAS, and had decided a priori that of course their paper was meritorious, so therefore everyone else was wrong. How awkward. They had to resort to publishing in what was, at best, a fringe journal with the primary criterion of how controversial a paper was, rather than on its merits, and tried to fluff it up with an <a href="https://archive.is/9T3wA">op-ed on the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal</a>, a disreputable cesspool of bad conservative nonsense, and finally dumped it in the Journal of Controversial Ideas, which seems to mostly publish right wing trash.</p>
<p>Then they wrote an afterword calling it &#8220;ironic&#8221;. Only in the Alanis Morisette sense of the word, I think.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Perhaps the grandest irony of them all, and the saddest commentary on the state of academia, is that this article, defending merit, could only be published in a journal devoted to airing “controversial” ideas.147 As we were finalizing the manuscript for publication, the Office of Science and Technology Policy of the White House released a 14­page long vision statement outlining the priorities for the U.S. STEMM ecosystem.148 The word “merit” appears nowhere in the document. In February, 2023, The National Academy of Sciences released a report titled “Advancing Antiracism, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in STEMM Organizations: Beyond Broadening Participation.” The report describes merit as a non­objective, “culturally construed” concept used to hide bias and perpetuate privilege, refers to objectivity and meritocracy in STEMM as myths, and calls for merit­ based metrics of evaluation to be dismantled.149</p></blockquote>
<p>Consider this: maybe just defending the magic word &#8220;merit&#8221;, while only vaguely defining it, and claiming that everyone who opposes racism is against merit, was considered a non-meritorious article? It was bad, sloppy, and dishonest, and that&#8217;s why it wasn&#8217;t accepted. What they want is a kind of affirmative action to privilege papers that favor a conservative viewpoint. It is the height of hypocrisy to demand that everyone else must meet their high standards, while waiving them for themselves.</p>
<p>Speaking of dishonest, that White House vision statement has the word &#8220;Excellence&#8221; right there in the title. They might want to consider investing in a thesaurus or dictionary over there in wingnuttia.</p>
<p>As for the NAS article, it&#8217;s 360 pages long. I only skimmed it, but it was easy to find where Krylov and pals were misrepresenting the work. Here&#8217;s what the NAS said about &#8220;culturally construed&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>STEMM organizations also express and transmit their cultures through processes such as hiring, admissions, tenure and promotion, and other activities that identify new members and promote those within. Conceptions of merit and excellence in doctoral admissions, for example, are not given or objective, but rather culturally constructed over time within disciplinary communities that have been mostly non-Hispanic White and mostly male; thus, the metrics of merit and excellence that institutions privilege in admissions reproduce cohorts of students who resemble what came before (Posselt, 2016). Faculty hiring and tenure committees make decisions using inherited norms of legitimate scholarship and scholarly behavior for one’s field, which are often themselves biased toward qualities that purport to be race neutral (Posselt, 2018; Gonzales, 2012). These norms can mask biases that affect “objective” processes, which, in fact, are socially and culturally constructed over time within disciplinary communities that have been homogeneous in terms of race and gender.</p></blockquote>
<p>Um, yes? That is correct. The Krylov article also failed to give a conception of merit that was not culturally constructed; I find it hard to imagine a definition of merit that can say that one person is better than another that isn&#8217;t thoroughly larded with subjective positions.</p>
<p>I must emphasize that one point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conceptions of merit and excellence…are not given or objective</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s the key issue here, and it&#8217;s one the Krylov paper glosses over and does not address. What is merit if not a culturally constructed metric? It&#8217;s right there in the final paper they cite, the fundamental problem that they simply ignore, writing a paper to defend &#8220;merit&#8221; without giving an objective definition of this thing that they claim is impartial and objective and essential to science.</p>
<p>By the way, the only places where the report uses the word &#8220;dismantle&#8221; is in reference to dismantling racism, not merit-based metrics. Those aren&#8217;t synonyms, although I suspect the authors think they are.</p>
<p>One last thing from that NAS paper…actually the first thing, since it comes from the preface.</p>
<blockquote><p>This report provides no simple answers to racial obstacles that date back beyond the origins of American history. The authors—a consensus committee of experts appointed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine—were selected for their deep engagement on issues of antiracism, diversity, equity, and inclusion in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM); as such, we are well aware of the challenge in using evidence-based action to remedy unfair systems, structures, and institutions that advantage some and disadvantage others on the basis of race and ethnicity. Undaunted, we tackled our charge to identify racist and biased conditions that create systemic barriers and impede the full talent pool of our nation from pursuing and advancing in STEMM careers. This report recommends actionable strategies, based on the scientific evidence reviewed herein and based on the lived experiences of practicing STEMM scientists, engineers, and medical professionals. </p></blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that this lengthy NAS report is one of the key examples used in the Krylov paper to show that CSJ supporters are abandoning the &#8220;liberal&#8221; ideal of assessing the evidence and rewarding merit…but it is written by a consensus committee of experts in STEM and uses the SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE to recommend ACTIONABLE STRATEGIES.  They Krylov gang are hypocrites. If they were serious about the importance of evidence and merit, they would accept the conclusions of this work. Unless they&#8217;re actually admitting that &#8220;merit&#8221; is a subjective phenomenon, that &#8220;merit&#8221; might mean one thing to the National Academies of Science and something altogether different to a group of self-appointed cranks who resent the whole idea of social justice. But that would completely undermine their whole paper!</p>
<p>I guess I should mention the terrible Wall Street Journal op-ed by Coyne &amp; Krylov. It&#8217;s even worse because it distills the Krylov paper into a shorter, more readable summary of their bad ideas in a way that will be read by many more people. Once again, it uses the word &#8220;merit&#8221; like a pointy sharp knife, oblivious to the possibility that it&#8217;s much more diffuse and not quite as crystalline as they imagine, while demonizing anyone who introduces values and greater concerns into the argument as people who hate science. So…they compare Social Justice advocates to…Trofim Lysenko.</p>
<blockquote><p>The crux of our argument is simple: Science that doesn’t prioritize merit doesn’t work, and substituting ideological dogma for quality is a shortcut to disaster. A prime example is Lysenkoism—the incursion of Marxist ideology into Soviet and Chinese agriculture in the mid-20th century. Beginning in the 1930s, the U.S.S.R. started to enforce the untenable theories of Trofim Lysenko, a charlatan Russian agronomist who rejected, among other things, the existence of standard genetic inheritance. As scientists dissented—rejecting Lysenko’s claims for lack of evidence—they were fired or sent to the gulag. Implementation of his theories in Soviet and, later, Chinese agriculture led to famines and the starvation of millions. Russian biology still hasn’t recovered.<br />
Yet a wholesale and unhealthy incursion of ideology into science is occurring again—this time in the West. We see it in progressives’ claim that scientific truths are malleable and subjective, similar to Lysenko’s insistence that genetics was Western “pseudoscience” with no place in progressive Soviet agriculture. We see it when scientific truths—say, the binary nature of sex—are either denied or distorted because they’re politically repugnant.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is absurd hyperbole, malicious and stupid. You can&#8217;t equate a broad-based social justice movement to a single terrible man given great power by a tyrannical autocrat. No one is being sent off to a gulag. What we have is a consensus among a large number of scientists that racism is wrong, that we cannot grow the scientific enterprise if we continue to discourage and exclude a significant proportion of the population. It&#8217;s about opening the doors and welcoming more people into the work, and about repudiating the bad ideas of the past, which is the only way to grow.</p>
<p>I hate to break it to Coyne and Krylov, but one of the basic principles of science is that it is malleable &#8212; we don&#8217;t possess absolute truths, but instead are constantly striving to reach the truth, and that our interpretations are subject to revision at all times. Those interpretations are necessarily subjective, since they&#8217;re formulated by human beings and shaped by context and history. We have so many examples of this truth from the history of science, such as race &#8220;science,&#8221; eugenics, the exclusion of women from science, and now this ongoing resistance to acknowledge past wrongs. The virtue of science is that it adapts and corrects itself; the weakness of conservative thought is that it resists necessary change and always supports the status quo, no matter how fallacious it might be.</p>
<p>It is Coyne &amp; Krylov who are rejecting the evidence now. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine assembled a whole book by multiple qualified authors to present the evidence for systemic racism and its deleterious effects on science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine, and these two jokers dismissed it out of hand because it didn&#8217;t support their vague ideas about the magic of &#8220;merit.&#8221; They wrote a paper so bad that it couldn&#8217;t be published anywhere except in a fringe journal full of crank conservative opinions, and now they&#8217;re going to lecture us on merit and science and accuse everyone who disagrees with them of being Lysenkoists.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to agree with them on one thing, though: letting ideology run roughshod over the data and evidence is wrong and bad and should be deplored. It&#8217;s just too bad that the paper they wrote is oblivious to the extreme ideology that drives their own opinions.</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s enough. That was seriously one of the worst papers I&#8217;ve ever read, and I read creationist drivel &#8212; it&#8217;s just that the Krylov paper actually has some respectable authors attached to it, although their respectability is greatly diminished by their association with the racist apologetics in this badly written paper.</p>

<p class="lead">All I can say is…<a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/05/18/lauren-boeberts-divorce-exposes-the-dark-little-secret-of-red-state-life/">you go, girl</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Boebert built her career on sanctimonious, though often incoherent, lectures on the supposed threats to the family of leftist sexual &#8220;depravities&#8221; like same-sex marriage or contraception use. She also filed for divorce last month, a fact that only got into the press this week. This follows other comical examples of Boebert&#8217;s &#8220;family values,&#8221; such as celebrating teen pregnancy or standing by her now-to-be ex-husband after he exposed himself to teen girls in a bowling alley. </p>
<p>Her choice to leave Jayson Boebert might be the first sign that there&#8217;s functioning brain activity in Lauren Boebert&#8217;s skull. As the bowling alley story suggests, the guy is a creep. He started dating then-Lauren Roberts when she was 16 and he was 22 years old. She dropped out of high school to give birth to their first child at 18. They got married two years later. During this time, he was arrested on domestic violence charges after a fight with her. In August, he was still at it, getting the cops called on him for reportedly threatening neighbors.</p></blockquote>
<p>She&#8217;s a great big evil hypocrite who is taking advantage of liberal social policies, but that&#8217;s exactly what they are for &#8212; to give even evil fucks the right to self-determination. Even right-wing Republicans who aren&#8217;t very bright.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This story is tasty gossip. But it&#8217;s also a window into an aspect of red state life that hasn&#8217;t been much discussed, one which is likely fueling the ugly surge in misogynist rhetoric and policy being pushed by Republicans, especially the men. The dark little secret of red state life is there&#8217;s a lot of Lauren Boeberts out there: Conservative women who disavow feminism, but, when given a shot at more independence for themselves, gladly use hard-won rights like divorce and abortion. Republican men are getting increasingly angry about even this minor loss of control over women.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cackling as the steps of the dastardly plan crystallized in her mind, local trans teen Brie Chandler told reporters Tuesday that she had hatched a nefarious plot to undergo years of medical treatments and counseling to win at swimming. “It’s oh, so simple: several years of sweet-talking medical professionals, receiving hormone therapies, and enduring complex gender-affirming surgeries, and that swimming trophy will be mine!” said the 17-year-old high school senior, who provided a step-by-step account of her knavish conspiracy to take fourth or even third place in a high school or Division III collegiate swimming competition by transitioning to a female identity. “I don’t even want to be a woman—I just want to win at swimming. Imagine how I’ll laugh with glee up there on the winners’ podium, knowing that all I had to do was lie about my gender identity issues through months or years of psychiatry sessions, take a shitload of androgen blockers, go to speech therapy, and recover from multiple invasive surgeries! Those feelings of isolation as my family members struggle to accept my social transition, the bureaucratic headaches of having to change my legal documents to reflect my correct identity, and becoming more likely to be the target of harassment from strangers will be nothing compared to holding that trophy in my devilish little hands!” The trans teen noted that there was only one thing threatening her nefarious ploy to change her gender to beat several girls at a regional swimming competition, which is that she doesn’t know how to swim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me and my overall lack of interest in sports, but I always wondered what was so valuable about a trophy or an entry in a record book that you would go through so much upheaval, and so much public vilification, to get a small and hypothetical edge in a competition. Is it possible that being trans doesn&#8217;t extirpate one&#8217;s interest in sports?</p>

<p class="lead">Every once in a while, it sinks into the creationist mind that they have a problem, the heat problem. They extraordinarily rapid transitions they claim had to have occurred &#8212; a globe-drowning deluge falling out of the sky and surging up out of the earth in a year, vast amounts of lava building huge geological features in a geological instant &#8212; would involve the release of immense amounts of heat, among the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html">multitude of impossibilities in their flood myth</a>. Just ask <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/creationists-cant-take-the-heat">Phil Plait</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Creationists need the Earth (and the Universe, don&#8217;t forget) to be 6000 or so years old, due to a lengthy list of &#8220;begattings&#8221; in the Bible. The problem is, we see lots of processes going on right now that are very slow &#8212; but we see their effect because the Earth is incredibly old. But if the Earth is young, these processes have to have been cooking a lot faster in the past. Cooking indeed, because these forces expel a lot of heat. And it can be hard to dump that heat: it has to go somewhere (like an oven heating up a room when you open the door), and we just don&#8217;t see that happening.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just imagine all the tectonic activity that we say was spread out over billions of years compressed into a single year, as creationists believe &#8212; there&#8217;d be enough heat generated to <a href="https://ncse.ngo/flaws-young-earth-cooling-mechanism">melt the crust of the Earth</a>. Or consider all the radioactive decay that occurred to generate the elements we find on the planet, which we say is an indicator of great age. They want all that to occur in about 6000 years, postulating in some cases that radiometric dating is falsified by accelerated rates of decay…boom, that would mean natural nuclear bombs would have been popping off constantly.</p>
<p>Some creationists realize this, and invent all kinds of wacky mechanisms for dissipating planet-melting quantities of heat. <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/05/creationist-paper-heat-problems.html">Dan Phelps finds one who admits the one true solution</a>: voila, it was a supernatural miracle.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>However, it is important to appreciate that our inability to identify an acknowledged mechanism for removing the excess heat deposited during and after the Flood, an issue first identified over 35 years ago (Baumgardner 1986), is only a problem in the sense that it represents the limited nature of our human understanding. In a biblical context there is no fundamental problem because God purposely brought about the Flood (Genesis 6:17) as a judgment on the wicked human race of Noah’s day and covenanted with Noah to preserve human and animal life through the cataclysm (Genesis 6:18). He sovereignly accomplished both objectives, implying that environmental temperatures could not have risen beyond biological endurance limits. The only real problem is our current lack of understanding of how this was accomplished; the Flood account in Genesis 6–9 does not tell us directly whether supernatural processes were involved, though it seems very likely that they were. The same basic issue arises in connection with the topics to be covered in Parts 5 (heat due to Accelerated Nuclear Decay) and 6 (heat due to bombardments from space) of this series, and will be considered at greater length in Part 7.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been saying for years that creationists have an easy out for dealing with the difficulties their model generates. Just say it was a miracle. Just say God did it.</p>
<p>Usually they are reluctant to do that because it&#8217;s an admission that they don&#8217;t actually have any kind of scientific explanation.</p>

As some states moved to criminalise abortion, there was outcry against the idea of pregnant women being treated as criminals for exerting agency over their own bodies. But, as a new report from researchers at the World Health Organization (WHO) makes clear, criminalisation of abortion is the norm, not the exception, globally. Of the 182 countries for which there was data as of October 2022, abortion was completely decriminalised in just one: Canada. Penalties range from fines to, in a handful of countries, life imprisonment. </p> <p>In the UK there is a widespread belief that abortion is not a crime. In England, Scotland and Wales, the procedure is legal if authorised by two doctors before 24 weeks&rsquo; gestation, or in cases where there are serious health risks to continuing the pregnancy. But it remains criminalised outside these parameters under legislation passed in 1861.</p> <p>Last year, at least two women were charged with abortion-related offences in England, both for allegedly taking abortion pills after the 24-week limit. One of the cases was dropped after prosecutors agreed it was not in the public interest to pursue it; the other woman pled guilty to unlawfully administering a poison or noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage, an offence under the 1861 law, and is awaiting sentencing. This year, already, at least two more people have been charged. </p> <p>Dozens of women have also been investigated over the past decade, according to a recent report in the <em>Observer</em>. Some were arrested in their hospital beds; at least one was jailed. A girl as young as 15 had her phone and laptop confiscated, for investigation, during her GCSE exams. Police produced text exchanges with her boyfriend, where she expressed doubt over having the baby, as evidence against her, before a coroner concluded that the pregnancy had ended due to natural causes. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Northern Ireland maintained a near-total ban on abortions until 2020, when Westminster took advantage of the collapse of Stormont&rsquo;s power-sharing deal to intervene. There are still 11 countries &ndash; including Andorra and Malta &ndash; where abortion is prohibited in all circumstances.</p> <p>The great irony of these laws is that they don&rsquo;t reduce abortions. A study in 2020 from researchers at the Guttmacher Institute and WHO found that the abortion rate was the same in countries where it was &ldquo;broadly legal&rdquo; as in those where it was completely banned. Meanwhile, even partial criminalisation can be dangerous, because it can discourage or delay women from seeking safe abortions and cause health workers to be overly cautious, even to the point of denying legal forms of care.</p> <p>The evidence is clear: criminalisation only serves to limit safe and regulated abortions, while putting women and girls at risk.</p> <p><em>This is a preview from New Humanist's summer 2023 issue. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Known as R21, it is the first for malaria &ndash; or indeed any parasitic disease &ndash; to exceed the World Health Organization&rsquo;s 75 per cent efficacy target. Parasites are much more complex than viruses or bacteria, so this is a major breakthrough.</p> <p>Preliminary results from final-stage trials have not yet been published, but Ghana has already cleared the vaccine for use in children aged 5-36 months &ndash; the group at highest risk of death from malaria. Nigeria followed suit shortly afterwards. The WHO is still reviewing the data to determine whether it will recommend the vaccine for widespread use.</p> <p>Part of the challenge of targeting the malaria parasite is that it changes its structure throughout its lifecycle. R21 targets the parasite at a very early stage, before it has spread extensively throughout the body. This rapid response is helped along by an &ldquo;adjuvant&rdquo; (an ingredient that boosts the body&rsquo;s immune response to vaccines) called Matrix-M, which comes from the Chilean soapbark tree.</p> <p>Another major obstacle has been funding. Pharmaceuticals typically invest in vaccines expecting to recoup the costs by selling them to wealthy countries. But malaria mostly affects lower-income countries. R21 was developed by researchers at Oxford University&rsquo;s Jenner Institute, which also developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19. Their work was supported by awards from the European Commission, UK Research and Innovation, the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Serum Institute of India, among others. According to Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, it is the first major vaccine to be approved by an African country before rich nations.</p> <p>The new vaccine is no silver bullet. Doubts remain about the reported efficacy as trials continue, and about the practicalities of delivery, as it requires three initial doses and possibly boosters, which can be a challenge in rural areas. Funding for a widespread rollout also remains an issue.</p> <p>However, R21 marks a major scientific advancement and brings significant hope in the fight against one of the world&rsquo;s deadliest diseases. It comes on the back of two decades of impressive progress against malaria, mainly through the use of antimalarial drugs, insecticides and nets. The disease has already been eliminated in 15 countries since 2000. Global eradication once seemed impossible. Increasingly, it looks like a practical aim.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

It comes on the back of high-profile demonstrations in recent years that have seen groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Black Lives Matter take actions such as blocking roads, airports and printing presses in a bid to raise public awareness and push politicians into action. Some of the new restrictions came into effect just days before the coronation of King Charles III, ahead of anticipated anti-monarchy protests.</p> <p>The government says it &ldquo;fully supports the right of individuals to engage in peaceful protest&rdquo; but that the &ldquo;guerrilla tactics&rdquo; and &ldquo;serious disruption caused by a small minority of protestors has highlighted that more needs to be done to protect the public and businesses from these unacceptable actions.&rdquo; But if Rishi Sunak and his party &ldquo;fully support&rdquo; the right to protest, they&rsquo;re doing an impressive job of hiding it. They already introduced new restrictions last year, under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. That act increased the instances in which police could intervene in protests. Intentionally &ldquo;causing a public nuisance&rdquo; &ndash; an offence which could cover peaceful actions like blocking the entrance to a building, or occupying a public space &ndash; is now punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and the jailing of peaceful protesters has already begun.</p> <p>This new law goes further again. It introduces new criminal offences, including &ldquo;locking on&rdquo;, where protestors chain themselves to buildings or objects, a tactic that was famously used by the suffragettes in the 1900s. That is now punishable by up to six months in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.</p> <p>Also newly criminalised are &ldquo;obstructing major transport works&rdquo;, &ldquo;interfering with key national infrastructure&rdquo; (the government has specifically mentioned airports and printing presses, both of which have been the sites of climate protests), and &ldquo;tunnelling&rdquo;, which is defined as &ldquo;creating&rdquo; or &ldquo;being present&rdquo; in a tunnel, &ldquo;where such an act is causing or capable of causing serious disruption&rdquo;. This last offence seems to specifically target anti-HS2 protesters, some of whom have occupied tunnels.</p> <p>The law also allows magistrates to ban particular people from attending protests, and extends police powers, allowing officers to stop and search people without suspicion of any wrongdoing in and near protest sites. Under normal circumstances, police generally need to have &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; to suspect that someone is carrying an illegal item or something that could be used to commit a crime in order to stop and search them. Even then, the racial discrimination involved in that assessment of suspicion is well known and there is little evidence that it is an effective tool to fight crime. These efforts to pre-emptively clamp down on protests are deeply concerning.</p> <p>The Lords rejected some of the most serious provisions &ndash; including a government bid to restrict the use of the right to protest on &ldquo;an issue of current debate&rdquo; as a defence in court. But this is not enough.</p> <p>Human rights organisations, and some politicians and lawyers, have condemned the law as an assault on democratic freedoms. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T&uuml;rk, called on the government to reverse the legislation. The new law imposes &ldquo;disproportionate criminal sanctions on people organising or taking part in peaceful protests,&rdquo; he said, and is &ldquo;wholly unnecessary as UK police already have the powers to act against violent and disruptive demonstrations&rdquo;. Four UN special rapporteurs on rights have also expressed &ldquo;grave concerns&rdquo;.</p> <p>There is, unfortunately, little chance that the government will pay any attention to the international outcry. This regressive law is likely here to stay, with far-reaching consequences for our democracy.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="'Night and Sleep' by Evelyn De Morgan. Credit: Heritage Image Partnership" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/MPWRM3.jpg" height="1324" alt="'Night and Sleep' (1878), a painting by Evelyn De Morgan, shows two people drifting through the air" width="1920"></p> <p>Sleep is a hot topic these days. Popular science books promise to uncover why we do it at all, while exploring its importance for a healthy life. Self-help manuals seek to teach the art of sleeping well amidst the stresses of modern life. Wearable devices and mobile apps monitor quality and quantity, nudging users to make adjustments to their bedtime routines. Meanwhile, last summer&rsquo;s heatwave produced endless variations of top tips for ensuring the right amount of sleep in sweltering temperatures.</p> <p>These examples do not just point to an increased curiosity for an activity that, after all, makes up a third of our lives. Rather, they suggest a certain anxiety around sleep and a desire to master it. The key goal of Matthew Walker&rsquo;s international bestseller <em>Why We Sleep</em>, for instance, was to demonstrate the importance of sleep to a society that, he argues, all too often neglects it with disastrous consequences for our health. That was published in 2018. Since then, the idea that our society may be experiencing a &ldquo;sleep crisis&rdquo; has become more popular, with reports that people&rsquo;s sleep debt &ndash; namely, the difference between the amount of sleep they need and the amount they actually get &ndash; has been rising in recent years.</p> <p>This concern over the number of hours people sleep, or fail to, has led to growing attempts at regimenting and optimising the night-time, be it through sleep-tracking, sleep-hygiene routines and sleep hacks, relaxation apps, or other assorted gadgets, from smart mattresses to smart light systems. Underlying these attempts is the sense that sleep should be harnessed. As one popular sleep-tracking wearable puts it: &ldquo;Sleep more. Achieve more.&rdquo;</p> <p>In this landscape, Alice Vernon&rsquo;s new book <em>Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It</em> offers a breath of fresh air. Vernon highlights the need to widen our conversations around sleep beyond the anxious focus on maximising the number of hours we spend doing it. Her stories of troubled sleep purposefully steer well clear of the subject of insomnia &ndash; a condition that has been the core theme of a recent boom of memoirs, such as Marina Benjamin&rsquo;s <em>Insomnia</em> (2018) and Samantha Harvey&rsquo;s <em>The Shapeless Unease: A Year of Not Sleeping</em> (2020).</p> <p>Instead, Vernon turns her attention to sleep disorders like somnambulism (sleepwalking), sleep paralysis and hallucinations. And of course, the titular night terrors: terrifying dreams which will typically cause the sleeper to scream and bolt out of bed, and which, unlike nightmares, the sleeper will typically not remember upon waking. Through exploration of these phenomena, <em>Night Terrors</em> invites us to embrace the weirdness of sleep and to look more closely at aspects of our night lives that often thwart any attempts at control.</p> <h2>Gateway to consciousness</h2> <p>The book is many things at once: a vivid memoir of Vernon&rsquo;s own experiences of troubled sleep, an accessible account of the science of the sleep disorders that are collectively known as parasomnias, and a rich cultural history of how these disorders have been interpreted and represented throughout the centuries. Such a fluid approach feels fitting. Sleep is both a subject of scientific research, about which we know more and more, and a phenomenon that can still elude our rationality and even fill us with utter horror, producing endless theories and fuelling the imagination. In skillfully weaving the strands of the book together, Vernon perfectly captures the liminal status of sleep.</p> <p>Parasomnias, the focus of <em>Night Terrors</em>, are undesirable movements, perceptions, behaviours and emotions that arise as the brain transitions between REM (rapid eye movement) sleep &ndash; the stage when dreams tend to occur &ndash; non-REM sleep and wakefulness. These disorders, Vernon tells us, are quite common: 70 per cent of people experience a parasomnia at least once over the course of their life, typically sleep-talking or nightmares. She points out that the real percentage is probably even higher, given that a feature of some sleep disorders is that, upon waking, people do not have any recollection of what they have experienced during the night. What is more, people may be reluctant to talk about them: there is still a certain stigma attached to these &ldquo;sleep demons&rdquo;, which for centuries were explained away through the supernatural, or seen as a mark of insanity.</p> <p><em>Night Terrors</em> argues that we need to talk more about parasomnias, both to combat this stigma and to give voice to what these disorders tell us about ourselves. In Vernon&rsquo;s impassioned writing, parasomnias emerge as an important gateway into different forms of consciousness, both individual and collective &ndash; which we ignore at our peril. &ldquo;Our little upheavals or our major traumas&rdquo;, she writes, &ldquo;can all come back through the trapdoor of sleep, so to ignore this part of ourselves can mean that we never really face what our dreams are telling us.&rdquo;</p> <p>The reader&rsquo;s journey starts with the very first parasomnia that Vernon experienced as a child: sleepwalking. We then move on to hypnopompic hallucinations &ndash; primarily visual hallucinations that manifest moments after waking up; think spiders scuttling on your pillow. Later on, we explore sleep paralysis, night terrors and, finally, dreams and nightmares.</p> <p>A thread running through the book is the story of Vernon&rsquo;s claustrophobic and manipulative relationship with a former teacher, whom she calls Meredith after mara, &ldquo;an Old Norse word for a witch who would lie on people&rsquo;s chests and try to suffocate them&rdquo;. The mara is what we now know to be sleep paralysis, a parasomnia where the body&rsquo;s inability to move &ndash; preventing us from acting out our dreams and hurting ourselves or the people we sleep with &ndash; continues after waking up. The person is lying down, fully awake and conscious, and yet entirely unable to move. Even screaming is impossible.</p> <p>This is a paradoxical and terrifying situation. In response, the brain can conjure up images of sinister figures looming over the sleeper and weighing them down, to explain the sensation of being pinned to the bed and the feeling of pressure on one&rsquo;s chest and limbs. While Meredith&rsquo;s oppressive hold on teenage Vernon is linked to a number of Vernon&rsquo;s experiences of parasomnias, it is most clearly reflected in the sleep paralysis &ldquo;demons&rdquo; that populate her nights later on in her life. Vernon describes how, during sleep paralysis, she feels &ldquo;crushed under the intense stare of Meredith, under her hands and her sharp nails&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Sleep paralysis, nightmares and dreams</h2> <p>The chapter on sleep paralysis is among the most engrossing. Beyond exploring the science of this parasomnia and providing memoiristic insights into the trauma that lies at the root of her own experiences, Vernon traces how the disorder has shaped paranoid beliefs across the ages. Looking at the historical records of the 17th-century Salem witch trials, for instance, Vernon learns how experiences of sleep paralysis generated several accusations of witchcraft in the trials. More recently, this parasomnia is thought to be the origin of many reports of alien abductions that supposedly happened at night and were accompanied by a peculiar heavy feeling. &ldquo;What we see during sleep paralysis,&rdquo; Vernon explains, &ldquo;has changed significantly as our cultural depiction of monsters has shifted&rdquo;.</p> <p>Parasomnias seem to have always played a role in the cultural imagination. <em>Night Terrors</em> is peppered throughout with insightful readings of historical paintings and texts, many of which are iconic, that draw on these strange and powerful phenomena. Vernon&rsquo;s reflections on Dracula, the protagonist of Bram Stoker&rsquo;s 1897 novel, note that he causes paralysis, somnambulism and night terrors in his victims. He was not just a vampire, she concludes, but &ldquo;every parasomnia combined in the figure of a folkloric monster&rdquo;. Just as vampires straddle life and death so do parasomnias &ndash; during these sleep disorders &ldquo;the waking, rational self is effectively &lsquo;dead&rsquo;.&rdquo; The book goes on to illustrate how many of our famous writers, from Robert Louis Stevenson to Shirley Jackson, drew inspiration for their fiction from their real-life experiences of various parasomnias.</p> <p>But it&rsquo;s not just that parasomnias can inspire creativity or that culture can help shed light on these strange sleep phenomena. Rather, Vernon argues that storytelling can have therapeutic potential when it comes to sleep. She points to the DreamsID project, a collaboration between sleep scientist Mark Blagrove and artist Julia Lockheart, in which participants share their dreams, nightmares and other parasomnias, whose findings seem to suggest that the process encourages empathy. Imagery rehearsal therapy is also discussed: a cognitive-behavioural treatment for reducing the number and intensity of parasomnias, where the patient is helped to reimagine their nightmares with different, less terrifying outcomes. There are also attempts being made to harness lucid dreaming, which allows people to be aware that they are sleeping and therefore lets them direct their own dreams.</p> <p>There is something deeply liberating about <em>Night Terrors</em>&rsquo; invitation to encounter sleep on its own terms, in all its weirdness and darkness. As Vernon writes, &ldquo;sleep isn&rsquo;t just about the number of hours, [or] the time it takes to nod off . . . Sleep is about stories. It&rsquo;s about monsters, and ghosts, desires, aggression, trauma and anxiety, health, creativity, and the state of our inner lives.&rdquo; Her book is a powerful reminder of what we miss when we think of sleep merely as something to master, in order that we might be more productive in the day.</p> <p><em>Alice Vernon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It&rdquo; is published by Icon.</em></p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks to Podimo and TellTale studios for supporting and producing the podcast.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
