<p>It was a simple procedure. I put the vials of happy gamboling spiders into the refrigerator to calm them down and numb them &#8212; I gave them about 15 minutes of chill. Then I went into each vial with a paintbrush and teased them out, and they descended into a tube of icy, pre-cooled alcohol, where they died within minutes. Now their bodies are packed into a freezer, awaiting delivery to the person who will chop them up.</p>
<p>The worst part was going through the assortment of spiders in the colony and having to <em>choose</em> which ones would die.</p>
<p>You have to understand that this was the very first time I&#8217;ve had to kill an adult spider. I&#8217;ve been wiping out embryos right and left, and I&#8217;ve had adults die of natural causes &#8212; but actually terminating their existence by my hand? Unpleasant. I like my spiders lively and interesting. I&#8217;m a biologist, not a necrologist.</p>

<p class="lead">It&#8217;s some kind of national holiday celebrating our independence, but I don&#8217;t feel like celebrating in a country where justice has been deposed and our supreme court is nothing but a corrupt arm of the far right Federalist Society. So instead I&#8217;m going to murder spiders.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a set of wild-caught <i>Steatoda triangulosa</i>, and another set of wild-caught <i>Parasteatoda</i>, and yet more long-term lab-fed <i>S. triangulosa</i>, and they&#8217;re all going to feel the kiss of cold 95% ethanol before being stashed in a freezer. Then this weekend they get delivered to a collaborator up north who will disembowel them and sequence their microbiome.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how we celebrate America&#8217;s birthday around here.</p>
<p>Also this weekend, we&#8217;re going to visit a few cemeteries around Gary, Minnesota and check out the graves of some long-dead relatives, and do some sight-seeing of great-great-great grandparents&#8217; old haunts, while also chasing down a few spiders. It seems appropriate.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="St Lawrence's church in Castle Rising, Norfolk. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/rodell1.jpg" height="913" alt="St Lawrence's church in Castle Rising, Norfolk" width="1368"></p> <p>By all accounts, Philip North is a very nice man. In fact, the Church of England, which appointed him as Bishop of Blackburn in January 2022, contains a lot of decent, well-meaning people. Unfortunately many of them are rather upset, because Philip North is opposed to the ordination of women priests.</p> <p>Apparently he does not object to women having authority over men, and has no problem working with women priests. But he does not think the Church of England should unilaterally take decisions which should be made together with the Roman Catholic, Orthodox and other Anglican churches. This is 30 years after the Church first accepted women priests, and seven years after it appointed its first female bishop.</p> <p>Just after North&rsquo;s appointment came the recommendations from a five-year study by Church of England bishops, supported by its General Synod after an emotional debate, that the Church should continue to deny church marriages to same-sex couples, but instead &ldquo;lament and repent of the failure&hellip; to be welcoming to LGBTQI+ people&rdquo; and provide &ldquo;prayers of thanksgiving, dedication and for God&rsquo;s blessing&rdquo; for same-sex couples married in civil ceremonies. At the same time, they voted to reaffirm the doctrine that marriage is only between a man and a woman.</p> <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also leads the global Anglican Communion, where &ldquo;The average Anglican is a woman in sub-Saharan Africa in her thirties&rdquo;. Anglican churches in the global south are vehemently opposed to same-sex marriage. He avoided a schism at the Communion&rsquo;s 2022 Lambeth Conference by persuading delegates to agree to disagree, while reaffirming a 1998 statement &ldquo;rejecting homosexual practice as incompatible with Scripture&rdquo;. After the Synod&rsquo;s &ldquo;blessings&rdquo; decision, he said he would not be giving any personally, and made emollient remarks to African bishops.</p> <p>It was not enough. The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches, which represents 10 of the 42 provinces in the Anglican Communion, responded by withdrawing its recognition of Justin Welby as the Communion&rsquo;s leader, stating that the Church of England was &ldquo;disqualified&rdquo; as their historic &ldquo;Mother Church&rdquo;.</p> <p>And the problem will not go away within the Church of England itself. &ldquo;We love and bless you, but your relationships are second class&rdquo; is not a sustainable message.</p> <p>These are not the only ethical challenges facing the Church. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse reported in 2020 that it had failed to protect children. More abuse revelations surfaced in 2022. It also has an ethnic issue. According to Mike Royal, the Pentecostal head of Churches Together in England: &ldquo;Urban Anglican Churches depend on black membership for their backbone.&rdquo; Yet a report on the General Synod early in 2022 was headed: &ldquo;Lord Boateng holds Synod&rsquo;s feet to the fire over Church&rsquo;s racism record.&rdquo;</p> <h2>A cliff edge</h2> <p>You may think, &ldquo;So what if the Church ties itself in knots?&rdquo; But these are symptoms of a bigger underlying issue which affects us all. To understand it, we need to look behind the &ldquo;Less than half of England and Wales population identifies as Christian&rdquo; headlines which accompanied the 2021 Census results. The Census is unrivalled when it comes to local detail, but provides no analysis of &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;. Fortunately we have the British Social Attitudes Survey (BSAS), which asks a more refined question about religious belonging, and provides a denominational breakdown.</p> <p>What it tells us is that Anglican identity is falling off a cliff. In the mid-1980s, around two in five British adults considered themselves Anglican. Now, half of British adults have no religious identity. Of the 40 per cent identifying as Christian, only a third are Anglicans. Around a fifth are Catholics, with the rest a mix of declining Nonconformist churches, and growing Orthodox, Pentecostal and smaller denominations.</p> <p>On the face of it, the Church has massive potential influence over the country&rsquo;s young people. It controls a quarter of England&rsquo;s state-funded primary schools, and some secondaries. Often they have faith-based admission criteria, and in many places the Church primary school is the only practical option for parents. A few years ago, the then chair of the Church&rsquo;s board of education, John Pritchard, called for clergy to be trained to use its schools to extend the Church&rsquo;s mission: &ldquo;The clergy ought to have a camp bed in there.&rdquo;</p> <p>But it is not working. The main driver of decline is not Anglicans leaving, but children of Anglicans not carrying on with the faith. While a third of people aged 75 and over identify with the Church, only one in a hundred under-25s do. One per cent. English Anglicanism is literally dying.</p> <p>Looking at practice rather than identity, the mathematician John Hayward applied the &ldquo;R number&rdquo; methodology familiar from Covid-19 to church attendance data, and concluded that the Church of England would become extinct around 2060. The response from Stephen Cottrell, the Archbishop of York, was that &ldquo;the church of Jesus Christ is not an organisation that lives or dies by graphs going up and down&rdquo;. This is the man who, in 2021, proposed a new growth strategy involving the establishment of 10,000 new lay-led churches over 10 years &ndash; around three a day &ndash; a plan which led Canon Angela Tilby to wonder whether &ldquo;in a desperate attempt to avoid facing&hellip; reality, we have entered a state of corporate psychosis: a leap into false consciousness&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Speaking in tongues</h2> <p>As well as shrinking, the Church is changing. For some time, it has been moving in an evangelical, and especially &ldquo;charismatic&rdquo; direction: the form of Christianity featuring personal experiences of the Holy Spirt, healing miracles, and speaking in tongues, a practice which Justin Welby says he began aged 19.</p> <p>A key vehicle has been the Alpha Course, which began at the &ndash; very posh &ndash; Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) Anglican Church in Kensington. It spread rapidly in the 1990s across the Church of England, and to other denominations and other countries, promising &ldquo;an opportunity to explore the meaning of life&rdquo;. HTB is now a major force in the Church, with nearly 100 churches in its network. But it has not stemmed the Church&rsquo;s overall decline.</p> <p>To understand this decline, it&rsquo;s useful to make a distinction between &ldquo;societal&rdquo; and &ldquo;congregational&rdquo; religion. In the past, the Church of England was &ldquo;societal&rdquo;: some people went to services, others just on special occasions. But most people felt they somehow belonged. That no longer applies. Evangelical Anglicanism is &ldquo;congregational&rdquo;. Its members are aware that many others think some of their practices bizarre, or their views strange. But they&rsquo;ve come to Jesus, and face a sinful world together.</p> <p>Yet, as we shall see, there are reasons why this smaller, increasingly evangelical, less &ldquo;white&rdquo; and more female entity will not simply take its place among others as it sinks into our diverse religion and belief landscape. The Church&rsquo;s &ldquo;established&rdquo; status is under increasing pressure, both because of its decline and because of its position on same-sex marriage. Yet Justin Welby still wants to keep the privileges that establishment brings, including 26 bishops in the House of Lords.</p> <p>He is not alone in wanting the Church to remain a part of the state. According to Bristol University&rsquo;s Tariq Modood, minority faiths also like this arrangement, in the belief that it provides a &ldquo;canopy&rdquo; of respect for all people of religious faith. It may go further than respect. There was some discussion, after Queen Elizabeth II&rsquo;s death, as to whether our new monarch should retain the role of Supreme Governor of the Church of England (see Andrew Copson in the Winter 2022 issue of New Humanist). Among the minority voices who spoke in favour of King Charles III&rsquo;s taking on the &ldquo;Defender of the Faith&rdquo; title was (Lord) Daniel Finkelstein, who expressed his belief that the role did more than protect the Anglican community. &ldquo;&hellip;as a Jew I feel I cannot be fully secure in respect for my own religion unless assurance is given by someone secure in what they themselves believe.&rdquo;</p> <p>In a recent survey for the think-tank Theos, a third of all non-religious people in the UK agreed that &ldquo;Religion is comparable to the smallpox virus, but harder to eradicate&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s important to note that this doesn&rsquo;t account for a third of all humanists.) That sounds like &ldquo;contempt for all religion&rdquo; &ndash; although, importantly, it does not mean &ldquo;contempt for all religious people&rdquo;. Meanwhile, there is no evidence that the established Church does anything to protect against antisemitism, or anti-Muslim prejudice.</p> <p>Clearly we must be careful not to allow an uncomprehending religious/non-religious divide to damage the country. The end of establishment for the Church of England, when it comes, might usefully be accompanied by a reassurance that human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, remain protected.</p> <h2>Financial atonement</h2> <p>There are also the finances to consider. We still have 16,000 Anglican church buildings, nearly 80 per cent of them &ldquo;listed&rdquo; by Historic England, many with small congregations.</p> <p>Operating and maintaining old buildings takes a lot of money. Fortunately, the Church has plenty of it. Unlike a company, with a Chief Executive and an annual report, the Church&rsquo;s finances are complex. In 2016, Ed Moore, then Treasurer of the National Secular Society, attempted to estimate its total wealth. He came up with over &pound;22 billion. Today, Church Commissioners manage &pound;10 billion in assets, in addition to the &pound;5 billion or so held by the 42 dioceses. Over the past 30 years, the Commissioners claim their average return has been an impressive 10 per cent. All of this is tax free (see Emma Park on page 42).</p> <p>From a purely financial viewpoint, then, the Church Commissioners could carry on indefinitely. Meanwhile, its diminishing band of parishioners manage to raise &pound;1 billion each year, but say they are desperately starved of funds. Although the Commissioners have recently increased their funding for the Church&rsquo;s operations, Justin Welby says the purpose is to provide &ldquo;support for mission so every person might hear the Good News of Jesus Christ&hellip; [and] support our aims to double the number of children and young disciples by 2030&rdquo;.</p> <p>The reaction from parish level was therefore predictable when the Church announced it would spend &pound;100 million to atone for the fact that some of its wealth &ndash; equivalent to &pound;1.4 billion in today&rsquo;s money according to one calculation &ndash; can be traced back to investments in slavery in the 18th century. The money would go on a &ldquo;programme of investment, research and engagement&rdquo; including funding to support &ldquo;communities affected by historic slavery&rdquo;. Nothing wrong with that, of course. But Rev Marcus Walker, chairman of Save The Parish, was understandably upset: &ldquo;After decades of telling us that there is no money to fund the churches and priests who keep the church alive on the front line, suddenly they&rsquo;ve found &pound;100 million behind the back of the sofa.&rdquo;</p> <p>There are no easy solutions to the problem of large numbers of listed buildings little used for their original purpose as places of worship. But a diminished Church cannot expect to protect a legacy of enormous wealth and tax-exempt investments, while at the same time starving its parishes and relying on charities, with a bit of government support, to conserve its estate.</p> <p>One beneficial use is as a base for local social action, of which the Church is rightly proud. Yes, plenty of non-religious people make important contributions here, as do non-Christian faith groups. But the Church has a physical presence in a lot more places, providing the infrastructure for foodbanks, playgroups and places to go in emergencies. As the traditional model of churches and vicars becomes increasingly unsustainable, new solutions will be needed to keep the social action baby while the Anglican bathwater flows away.</p> <h2>Hollowed out</h2> <p>For the time being at least, the Church retains a carapace of a great national institution: massive wealth; still-significant power; a substantial bureaucracy, both centrally and duplicated across 42 dioceses (with more senior clergy now than 20 years ago); buildings in virtually every city, town and village, many of cultural importance; the Head of State as its Supreme Governor, reflecting its established status; and control over a quarter of the country&rsquo;s state-funded primary schools.</p> <p>But inside the carapace, it is hollowed out. While many appreciate its social work, musical tradition, buildings and people, a rapidly diminishing number identify with it, share its metaphysical beliefs, subscribe to its positions on LGBTQI+ equality &ndash; and still, in some places, gender equality &ndash; or attend its services.</p> <p>You would not know that by reading its strategy. Its vision is still to be &ldquo;A Church for the whole nation which is Jesus Christ centred, and shaped by, the five marks of mission&rdquo;, the first two of which are all about evangelism and proselytisation. As well as becoming &ldquo;younger and more diverse&rdquo;, its strategic priorities are to become a church of &ldquo;missionary disciples&rdquo;, where &ldquo;every person in England has access to an enriching and compelling community of faith by adding new churches and new forms of Church.&rdquo;</p> <p>This is the &ldquo;corporate psychosis&rdquo; speaking. Sooner or later, reality must strike, and the carapace adapt to its contents. The question is how this major transition will take place, over what period, and what sort of creature will emerge at the end. We all have an interest in the answer.</p> <p>Whatever happens, there is no case for a diminished Church to have a privileged status in the constitution of a plural, and increasingly non-<br>religious, country. Establishment, and with it bishops in the House of Lords, needs to go. And an institution with an evangelical agenda overtly targeting young people should not be in control of state-funded schools.</p> <p>Aside from that, maybe a values-based approach offers a way forward. Many people would agree with the other &ldquo;Marks of Mission&rsquo;&rsquo;, which are about social justice, violence reduction, peace and reconciliation, and the environment. Instead of faith-based structures accommodating people with a range of values, could there be values-based structures accommodating people with a range of beliefs?</p> <p>Maybe a new values-based body, or local community trusts, should take ownership of many of the buildings, and most of the wealth, with the Church becoming one of many users of its spaces. Perhaps such a body could find a way, without erasing the history, to provide a community focus without the religious baggage, where everyone locally could feel at home, irrespective of their beliefs, ethnicity, education or income &ndash; an increasingly important need in a fractured society.</p> <p>But conversations about a realistic future are hard to envisage while Church leaders continue in their &ldquo;state of false consciousness&rdquo;. Accepting and managing decline is hard, especially when you think your mission is God-given. But at some stage, something has to give.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="'The Circle of Love' (1917) by Gerda Wegener. Credit: Bridgeman Images" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bal_79151.jpg" height="782" alt="'The Circle of Love' by Gerda Wegener is a painting from 1917 depicting an erotic relationship between two women" width="800"></p> <p>A recent YouGov poll asked Britons about their &ldquo;love language&rdquo;. The survey referred to US author Gary Chapman&rsquo;s concept of the &ldquo;five love languages,&rdquo; which are summarised as quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service and touch. To most British men and women, praise and time together were the preferred ways to feel loved by their partners. But some of the results were strikingly gendered. Over 20 per cent of men placed utmost importance on physical touch, while only 7 per cent of women cared about it. The figures were practically flipped when it came to acts of service, considered to be &ldquo;helping&rdquo; or doing those little things that make someone&rsquo;s life easier.</p> <p>The poll, while not straightforwardly pernicious, is nonetheless problematic. The idea of &ldquo;love languages&rdquo; is a piece of pop psychology, rather than a scientific phenomenon. The results reinforce the idea that, when it comes to love, men value sex, while women value atonement.</p> <p>Historian Eleanor Janega is concerned about the way concepts such as &ldquo;love languages&rdquo; are being co-opted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing a lot of reactionary ideas come to the forefront and a real pushing of the idea that women are first and foremost baby machines, and that we exist in this biological capacity where we are always and for ever at a kind of disadvantage to men,&rdquo; Janega said at the 2 March launch of her latest book, <em>The Once and Future Sex</em>.</p> <p>Misogynist propagandists like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate often push this notion that women are naturally nurturing and subdued beings, corrupted by feminist ideology. Men, in turn, are instinctive, corporeal creatures. In response, Janega decided to do a &ldquo;real deep-dive, historical look at gender&rdquo;, reminding us all that its perceived natures and assigned duties are blatantly socially constructed.</p> <p>For this, she turned to a historic period that is relatively unexamined when it comes to the female perspective, let alone when related to sex and desire. <em>The Once and Future Sex</em> explores the ways in which women were seen in the course of the roughly 1,000 years we call the Middle Ages. Between the fifth and 15th century, the book shows, women weren&rsquo;t seen as inherently frigid homebodies or delusional romantics. As Janega puts it, &ldquo;the majority of recorded European history thinks that women are innately sex-crazed.&rdquo; Similarly, her research shows how the great majority of women in the Middle Ages worked outside the home, in the fields, as shop- or innkeepers, as midwives or maids, or in the many industries and crafts of the period.</p> <p>Women were also not seen as exceptional when holding jobs, even when married with children. In fact, those who could proficiently run household or business accounts and manage staff were understood as assets and better wives. The <em>Once and Future Sex</em> is peppered with such examples and anecdotes, helping us not only humanise our foremothers, but also remember how profoundly historically contextual our ideas of women are. With stories like that of the 15th-century London wool merchant Rose of Burford, who upon her husband&rsquo;s death continued running the business and even settled fiscal arrangements with the crown, or of her French contemporary Christine de Pizan, the court author who wrote the &ldquo;equivalent of a medieval best seller&rdquo;, <em>The Book of the City of Ladies</em>, Janega spurs you on until the final page.</p> <p>Her conclusion is that, while those 1,000 years are indeed the pillars upon which western societies are built, medieval people and their thoughts are not transposable to our times, nor can they possibly serve as illustration to contemporary sexist tropes. On the contrary, as Janega writes, &ldquo;seeing the past and rejecting it allows us to imagine new futures and make the changes that are necessary to create a more equitable world.&rdquo;</p> <p>It is in the spirit of creating a more equitable world that journalist Sophie K. Rosa&rsquo;s debut book <em>Radical Intimacy</em> is written. With great diligence, Rosa goes about exploring the ways in which our socioeconomic system robs us of authentic and liberatory intimacy. The book explores alternative narratives for love and intimacy, reporting on the communities who have over the last century proven that there is life beyond the mainstream norms &ndash; not only when it comes to romance and family, but also wider issues like death and home ownership, friendship, care and solidarity.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s an ambitious book by a great reporter, and the research is exhaustive: from the Gay Liberation Front London communes of the 1970s to today&rsquo;s Campaign for Psych Abolition, fighting against the incarcerating and often punitive nature of psychiatric care. But one keeps wanting to hear Rosa&rsquo;s voice through the beautifully woven stats and quotes. While the introduction feels like a rousing call to arms, the rest of the book reads like a collection of journalistic pieces.</p> <p>Despite their very different topics, Janega and Rosa&rsquo;s books work well in tandem. Where one confronts misinformed tropes with the real lives of women living 500 years ago, the other shows us that there is nothing inevitable about patriarchal or heteronormative relations: we are living side by side with the alternatives.</p> <p>Both prove vital reading in a world struggling for palliative answers and often resorting to regressive ideologies. Both provide hope. And both prove how women do not uniformly fit into the boxes provided by pseudo-scientific theories like the five love languages. Women have been sex workers, sole landowners, squatters, carers, artists, asexual, bisexual, queer or not identifying as women at all. And all these people, past and present, have experienced moments of authenticity and moments of intimacy &ndash; not just in spite of, but often because of, their idiosyncrasies.</p> <p><em>Eleanor Janega's "The Once and Future Sex" is published by W.

Credit: Alamy Stock Photo" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Mussolini.jpg" height="1007" alt="Benito Mussolini stands on a podium in 1935" width="1368"></strong></p> <p><strong>Mussolini in Myth and Memory: The First Totalitarian Dictator</strong> (Oxford University Press) by Paul Corner</p> <p>The United States is not the only democracy flirting with the idea of destroying itself. Russians, Romanians, Italians &ndash; people from all over the world are falling back in love with dictators and dictatorships they fervently rejected not too long ago. Joseph Stalin, declared a criminal by his successors, is now being depicted alongside Vladimir Putin as a strong, feared leader. Nicolae Ceaușescu, who upon his arrest was executed as quickly as possible so he wouldn&rsquo;t be lynched by his own followers, was remembered favourably by 65 per cent of Romanians, according to a 2018 survey. Even Benito Mussolini, whose mutilated body was hung upside down at the Piazzale Loreto in Milan, somehow managed to gain the sympathy of the children and grandchildren of the Italians who celebrated his death.</p> <p>How did we get here? Using Italy as a case study, Paul Corner&rsquo;s <em>Mussolini in Myth and Memory </em>argues it all comes down to collective memory, the way it forms and is manipulated. Faced with problems like economic recession, political instability and changing social norms, people seek refuge in &ldquo;phantom utopias&rdquo;: augmented versions of the past in which memories of violence and suppression are themselves suppressed. Corner builds on ideas introduced by Russian sociologist Lev Gudkov (&ldquo;Soviet ideological slogans get reborn in the mass consciousness, but are mistaken for a reality &ndash; a phantom utopia &ndash; that never existed&rdquo;) and filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini (&ldquo;We are a country without memory, which is like saying without history. Italy removes its recent past&hellip; keeping only those memories, those fragments that might be useful for its contortions, its conversions&rdquo;) to create an original, insightful study of the 20th century and its aftermath.</p> <p>Each chapter identifies a popular misconception about Mussolini&rsquo;s rule, discerns the purpose it serves in present-day Italy and gathers historical evidence to show why it is incorrect. Examples include: Mussolini made the trains run on time; Mussolini destroyed the mafia; siding with Nazi Germany was Mussolini&rsquo;s one key mistake; and Mussolini alone bears responsibility for Italy&rsquo;s actions before and during the Second World War. The notion that Mussolini reduced crime betrays frustration with the slow-moving administration of justice in bureaucratic democracies, just as the belief that Mussolini introduced pensions is rooted in financial insecurity. In truth, writes Corner, there is no evidence to suggest he made Italy less criminal, and while his regime did extend pensions, the foundations of those systems were put in place long before he rose to power. The misconception that Mussolini is responsible for Italy&rsquo;s actions is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it absolves Italians from the guilt of the war crimes they committed. On the other, it reinforces the image of Mussolini as all-powerful.</p> <p>Corner admittedly focuses more on the past than the present &ndash; a bit disappointing considering the book&rsquo;s title promises readers they will learn how the former is contained in the latter. Instead of merely reframing the work of other historians, it would have been fitting to see him devote a bit more time and energy to those aspects that make<em> Mussolini in Myth and Memory</em> unique. But popular opinion on Mussolini &ndash; or any other subject &ndash; is difficult to pin down without resorting to surveys and statistical research, which would have slowed the book&rsquo;s arresting pace.</p> <p>If you want to get a better understanding of the rise, fall and persistence of fascism, this is a good book to start with. Corner&rsquo;s central theme of collective memory and phantom utopias gives the reader a theoretical framework through which to organise information provided by other, more conventional studies. Corner, who served as the director of the Centre for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes in Siena, is doing more than fact-checking fake news. His is a study of how fake news &ndash; for lack of a better term &ndash; enters the world and warps it accordingly.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here for access to the full magazine</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="'Old Man in Sorrow' by Vincent van Gogh. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/CRKX0E.jpg" height="1890" alt="'Old Man in Sorrow' by Vincent van Gogh" width="1519"></p> <p>In November 1901 a woman named Auguste Deter was admitted to the Municipal Asylum for Epileptics and Lunatics in Frankfurt. She was 51 years old. Paranoid delusions about her husband&rsquo;s fidelity had given way to amnesia and disorientation; she failed to recognise old friends and forgot life&rsquo;s daily occurrences the moment they were past. Soon she was unable to look after herself entirely. &ldquo;I have lost myself,&rdquo; she told her 36-year-old physician. His name was Dr Alois Alzheimer.</p> <p>Alzheimer was that rare thing at the turn of the 20th century, a doctor with an interest in both psychiatry, the workings of the mind, and histology, the study of cell tissue and structure. When he examined Deter&rsquo;s brain after her eventual death in 1906, he found it alarmingly atrophied, abnormally light. Then, looking at it under the microscope, he saw two things he had never seen before. First, the buildup of a brain protein named beta-amyloid into what are known as &ldquo;senile plaques&rdquo;; second, dense tangles of fibrils within the brain&rsquo;s cells that had gone rogue, as it were, choking and ultimately destroying the cells themselves. The damage was greatest where the tangles and the plaques coincided. As many as a third of the cells in Deter&rsquo;s cerebral cortex were destroyed or damaged.</p> <p>If it seems paradoxical that one of the definitive diseases of old age should have been first identified in someone much younger, Alzheimer himself regarded his discovery as a disease of middle age and entirely distinct from senile dementia. It was a view that held until the 1970s, when it became clear that they were essentially the same phenomenon; the neurologist Robert Katzman showed that Alzheimer&rsquo;s was one of the leading causes of death in the US, its presence in the deceased elided by a wide range of more immediately catastrophic health events recorded on the death certificate.</p> <p>Somehow it seems apt for Alzheimer&rsquo;s to be hiding in plain sight like that. It is after all a disease of deception, its presence masked in the patient by the general cognitive decline that we all experience once we pass the age of 50 or so. This can be compounded by the patient&rsquo;s own unwillingness or inability to recognise or acknowledge the disease as it encroaches, and by the person&rsquo;s stubborn, desperate retention of routine and behaviour &ndash; even while memory and, arguably, identity crumble around them.</p> <p>My father died of Alzheimer&rsquo;s three days after his 90th birthday in May 2016. He had been admitted with sepsis four days earlier, but his renal functions had been failing, resulting in repeated spells in hospital, since the previous autumn. There was one long spell of about a month in the spring from which he never really rallied. All semblance of independent life ended. There were four 15-minute visits from health workers spread across the empty plain of the day, and then soon a nurse staying overnight in case he accidentally pulled his catheter out &ndash; and, more generally, to comfort a newfound panic that overwhelmed him when he was alone, particularly at night.</p> <p>It can&rsquo;t have been much more than a week into this new restricted life that he stopped coming downstairs, or even getting out of bed. He ate less and less. By this time he was incontinent as well as cathetered and had lost any sense of the indignity of the experience, lost his sense of privacy, of decency, of inhibition. He would have been appalled, had he known. He was, I would have said, a proud man; he wanted to live in his home of 50 years on his own terms. The change was disorienting. A few weeks earlier, in hospital, he had to be physically restrained by two security guards to stop him discharging himself against medical advice. Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards were invoked. He was sedated. Most of that fight seemed to have drained away. It&rsquo;s tempting to say that he gave up the ghost: it implies a degree of agency and choice on his part, and the dignity that goes with a sense of volition. It&rsquo;s impossible to know if that is actually true; but it is comforting, in a small way, to think it might be.</p> <h2>The role of loneliness</h2> <p>Memory plays tricks on all of us. Or rather, we conspire with it in a process that psychologists call &ldquo;coherence&rdquo;, shaping memories to fit narratives we find more comfortable, or that accommodate our present sense of self better. My recollection is that Dad&rsquo;s difficulties date to the last couple of years of his life, but going back through the emails between myself and my three siblings to research this piece, I see that we had serious concerns about his memory at least as far back as 2011. Perhaps I want to avoid thinking about ways in which those last years might have been better for him. Perhaps we should have pushed him harder to recognise his predicament. But would the emotional distress, never mind the potential of ruptured familial relationships, have been worth the cost? It is not as if it is a disease with a cure. Perhaps he was already, in some senses, unreachable.</p> <p>Our mother had died of esophageal cancer early in 2009, and grief, loneliness and depression weighed heavily on my father. I don&rsquo;t think it was a sorrow he ever had the wherewithal to adapt to, never mind overcome. He was prescribed citalopram, an anti-depressant, but we were never sure how reliably he took it. We were never sure how reliably he took any medication in those years. He bristled at the intrusion whenever we enquired; the irritation, touched with defensiveness, was entirely in character, but I wonder now how much that kind of sensitivity, possibly extending to resentment, was related to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s. The hippocampus nestles beside the amygdala in the brain, and the amygdala regulates the great primal emotions.</p> <p>Perhaps it was a function of the disease too, then, that he seemed to be more emotional about Mum&rsquo;s loss the longer it receded into the past. When we all met on the anniversary of Mum&rsquo;s death, or on her birthday, on the hillside where we had scattered her ashes, Dad took to throwing himself to the ground and kissing the earth where the ashes had fallen. Hitherto, he had been among the most reserved of people; the only time I ever saw him express intense physical affection for Mum was at her death, when he showered her cold face with kisses and sobbed.</p> <p>Looking back now, I can see that Dad&rsquo;s situation was fertile ground for Alzheimer&rsquo;s to take root in.</p> <p>Sandeep Jauhar&rsquo;s new book, <em>My Father&rsquo;s Brain</em>, is a moving account of his father&rsquo;s illness and eventual death. Like my own father, Jauhar&rsquo;s had lost his wife a few years earlier; like Dad, too, he had a successful career in which intellect played a key role. He cites a 2007 study which suggests there is a strong correlation between loneliness and the development of Alzheimer&rsquo;s; and another, from 2020, which found that the recently widowed decline mentally three times as quickly as those who have not experienced such wrenching, disabling griefs.</p> <p>I wish I had known about that correlation. But I don&rsquo;t know how easy it would have been to make use of it. It&rsquo;s sometimes said that Alzheimer&rsquo;s destroys the self. Ultimately, perhaps, it does, if the patient lives long enough to reach the final stage where the disease attacks not just memory but motor function, the ability to undertake such fundamental tasks as swallowing. Dad died before he reached that extremity. I think we must be grateful for that. In one moment of clarity in those last weeks, he described the disease to me as a kind of hollowing out; he said he looked inside himself and found a blackness, as if what remained of memory and the self clung vertiginously to the outer limits of his identity. I think it terrified him. Looking back, though, what feels remarkable is not the loss of self, but its persistence.</p> <h2>Memory and the self</h2> <p>The relationship between memory and the self has long been argued over. Jauhar notes the 18th-century philosopher David Hume&rsquo;s observation in his <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em> that &ldquo;Had we no memory, we never should have any notion of causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and effects, which constitute our self or person.&rdquo; Late in life the surrealist film maker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel wrote poignantly in his memoir <em>My Last Breath</em>: &ldquo;You have to begin to lose your memory, if only in bits and pieces, to realise that memory is what makes our lives. Life without memory is no life&hellip; Our memory is our coherence, our reason, our feeling, even our action. Without it, we are nothing.&rdquo; But are we only the sum of our own memories? Does the self only have meaning in terms of the interior life? &ldquo;The conventional paradigm about what constitutes a person does not give adequate import to the richness of a human being outside of his cognitive capacities,&rdquo; Jauhar writes. &ldquo;Human beings exist not only in an inner world but also in a public space. It is that space that continues to give meaning to the lives of people living with severe dementia.&rdquo;</p> <p>It&rsquo;s an idea also explored in another new book on the subject, Dasha Kiper&rsquo;s <em>Travellers to Unimaginable Lands</em>, a psychologically acute and compelling series of case studies exploring the relationship between the carer and the dementia patient. &ldquo;The notion that there is a part of ourselves that is entirely separate from others is most likely a fiction,&rdquo; she writes. There is no &ldquo;us&rdquo; that is distinct from &ldquo;how people see us&rdquo;. &ldquo;Neurologically speaking, there is no special place in the brain that is hermetically sealed from the influence of other people. Quite the contrary: the self is porous.&rdquo;</p> <p>A related theme in Kiper&rsquo;s book resonated powerfully with me: the idea that Alzheimer&rsquo;s is emotionally and mentally disabling for the carer, as well as the patient. &ldquo;We simply have no cognitive framework that allows for [memory&rsquo;s] absence in others,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;Human beings did not evolve to function in isolation, and in fact each person&rsquo;s cognition is dependent on the cognitive faculties of those around them. So when one person&rsquo;s memory is impaired, those close to him or her also become disoriented.&rdquo; That is, Alzheimer&rsquo;s bends the world to its rhythms and processes. It&rsquo;s quite totalitarian in this regard. Alternate realities &ndash; narratives, perspectives, points of view &ndash; are not viable.</p> <h2>Extraordinary intimacies</h2> <p>To accompany a loved one into the horror of Alzheimer&rsquo;s is to negotiate extraordinary intimacies at the limit of human experience to which you are the only witness. You have to keep privately reminding yourself what is occurring, what has occurred. Your memory of events becomes a kind of private resistance to the disease. But in the public space between you and the patient, Alzheimer&rsquo;s obliterates you too. Faced, say, with endlessly repeated questions or statements, you can tell the truth and say, &ldquo;We just talked about that&rdquo;. But it won&rsquo;t change the sequence of events. Or you can acquiesce, play the game as it were, and respond to each moment as if it is new to you too. Either way, Alzheimer&rsquo;s wins. Its reality trumps your reality.</p> <p>&ldquo;In the end,&rdquo; a neurologist tells Jauhar, &ldquo;all dementias look alike. The whole brain is affected. Patients generally can&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo; But the journey to that end is surely unique &ndash; or as unique as the person for whom you are caring, as unique as your relationship with them. In the same way as my relationship with my dad was not the same as his with each of my siblings, however much common ground we shared, I am sure my experience of his Alzheimer&rsquo;s was different, because it was grounded in the deep memory of our prior history. Alzheimer&rsquo;s strips away almost everything that is individual. But even when language and memory failed Dad the most, there were still the bare, non-verbal, human things of touch and companionship, comfort and care which we gave him, each as we could: a kind of somatic continuity to counterbalance the strobing discontinuous struggle of surviving as each brief moment of existence flashed past unremarked to make way for the next. I don&rsquo;t know if it mattered to him; it felt very much like it did. What does it matter if he didn&rsquo;t remember afterwards?</p> <p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s, writes David Shenk in his classic study <em>The Forgetting</em>, &ldquo;is not only a disease, but also a prism through which we can view life in a way not normally available to us&hellip; it forces us to experience death in a way it is rarely otherwise experienced&hellip; It is more painful than many people can even imagine, but it is also perhaps the most poignant of all reminders of why and how human life is so extraordinary. It is our best lens on the meaning of loss.&rdquo; We are social animals. We need community, even if that is a community of two people. We need reciprocity, a sense of the shared moment. But reciprocity requires a mutual understanding. What happens then if there is only one person to understand, to remember?</p> <p>As a historian, as a writer, I think a lot about memory and erasure, memory and loss. Absences in the record. The value of testimony. The sense of my father&rsquo;s life &ndash; all those unshared, unwritten memories flaking away, falling into oblivion in those last months, perhaps years &ndash; was almost palpable. But if the self is not limited to the individual memory, if it is in some senses a shared construct, a shared endeavour, then it is important to rescue what can still be rescued, and not to write off the ends of life, to compound one erasure with another.</p> <p>Towards the end of the 20th century there was a sometimes vituperative debate about the historiography of the Holocaust. Put very crudely, the argument was about whether it is possible even to write history about such a subject: narrative history is inevitably selective, cohering to an argument, and ultimately a kind of falsification, the thinking runs. Critics of this position saw it as an attack on the status of survivor testimony that opened the door to Holocaust revisionism and denial. The Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg&rsquo;s contribution was an essay titled &ldquo;Just One Witness&rdquo;. He begins by citing the extermination of the entire Jewish community in a village in Provence in 1348, in the wake of the Black Death, for which the only evidence now is the written memory of a single survivor. We cannot, as historians, disregard such testimony, he argues, even if there is nothing reciprocal in the record to confirm it. It exists; we must make sense of it.</p> <p>That essay, or its core sentiment, has been rattling around my head writing this. For all the grinding bewilderment and exhaustion of those months, there is a kind of privilege to care for someone in these straits. A privilege to travel with someone into such a bleak, strange part of human existence. To travel with them, and bring the last of them back with you. Two people, one supporting the other. One community of two. One witness. One love.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Nuclear fusion is the power source of the sun and the stars. Image credit: Andrey Grinkevich" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/andrey-grinkevich-0x6RTts1jRU-unsplash.jpg" height="1080" alt="A bright yellow sun rises over mountains in Nevada" width="1920"></p> <p>There has been a lot of excitement lately about harnessing nuclear fusion, the power source of the sun and stars, and so gaining access to limitless green energy. Is it all hype? Well, put it this way. The joke since the 1950s has been that commercial fusion is always 50 years away. Now it appears to be only 30 years away!</p> <p>So, what is this promising process, able to produce abundant energy without greenhouse gases? Readers may be more familiar with nuclear fission, the process behind the atomic bomb and nuclear reactors, which involves splitting the core, or &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo;, of a heavy atom, to make lighter nuclei. In nuclear fusion, light nuclei are melded together to make a heavier one. When light nuclei like hydrogen fuse, or heavy nuclei like uranium split, surplus energy gushes out. Pound for pound, a nuclear fuel contains at least a million times as much energy as a &ldquo;chemical fuel&rdquo; like coal or oil.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why nuclear fusion is so attractive, but let&rsquo;s look at the practicalities. The sun fuses hydrogen into helium, with the by-product being sunlight, but the reaction is far too slow for use on Earth. Instead, the focus has been on gluing together deuterium (a heavy form of hydrogen that is readily available in seawater) with tritium (an even heavier but fast-decaying form, which has to be created by artificial nuclear reactions).</p> <p>The difficulty with fusion is that light nuclei like hydrogen need to be slammed together extremely violently in order to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion, which is ferocious. Such collisions in practice occur only at an extremely high temperature. But, whereas the fusion of hydrogen in the sun requires a temperature of 15 million degrees, the fusion of deuterium and tritium requires a temperature of more than 100 million degrees.</p> <p>And herein lies the problem. How do you generate such extraordinary temperatures on Earth without destroying everything in the vicinity?</p> <p>There are two main approaches. One is to confine a super-hot &ldquo;plasma&rdquo; of deuterium and tritium by means of powerful magnetic fields in a machine with a doughnut or &ldquo;torus&rdquo; shape. The other is to compress and heat peppercorn-sized pellets of deuterium and tritium, one after another, by hitting them from all sides with mega-lasers.</p> <p>Both fusion methods have scored significant successes of late, which is the reason for the current excitement. In December 2021, at Culham near Oxford, the Joint European Torus (JET) maintained the necessary fusion temperature for 5 seconds. Crucially, 59 million joules of energy more than was put in came out &ndash; enough to boil about 60 kettles. A year later, the US National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California got out 1.1 million joules more than it put in.</p> <p>These are undoubtedly milestones on the way to a commercial fusion reactor, but there is a long journey ahead to scale up the technology. JET&rsquo;s successor, the impressively huge International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, funded by 35 countries, is currently under construction in Southern France. But it will be only a test reactor, not a commercial reactor. And if laser-based, or &ldquo;inertial&rdquo;, fusion is ever to be viable, it will need to be able to induce fusion in not just one pellet but several pellets every second.</p> <p>Currently, it is immensely hard to make a pellet that is perfectly spherical enough that it implodes sufficiently uniformly to create the necessary fusion temperatures. The cost per pellet will also need to come down from its current level of a few hundred thousand dollars to a few tens of cents. The challenges are substantial, but so is the promised reward: unlimited energy from seawater, one of the most abundant resources on the planet, with no greenhouse gases generated, at least not directly.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s important to be clear when it comes to green credentials. It is not quite true that nuclear fusion has no radioactive waste problems. Neutrons escaping from the fusion reactions cannot be confined by magnetic fields, on account of being electrically neutral, and will inevitably make the material of any containment vessel radioactive. Fusion proponents, however, say the radioactivity will not be as long-lived and problematic as from fission reactors.</p> <p>If all goes to plan, a new era of clean and plentiful energy will dawn in the 2050s, with the construction of the first commercial fusion reactors. Unless, of course, some unexpected hitch occurs, flipping that horizon back to its perennial 50-year state.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks to Podimo and TellTale studios for supporting and producing the podcast.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->
