<p class="lead">The other day, we were concerned that Twitter would lose its Apple app, with a devastating loss to its revenue. <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/elon-musk-warned-by-european-union-that-twitter-will-be-banned-unless-he-sticks-to-blocs-digital-rules-report-12758900">What about losing Europe</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>The European Union has reportedly threatened to ban Twitter unless Elon Musk abides by its strict content moderation rules.</p>
<p>The warning, which has been reported by The Financial Times, could be the start of a regulatory battle over the future of the social media platform across Europe.</p>
<p>EU industry chief Thierry Breton made the threat during a video meeting with Musk on Wednesday, the news outlet said, citing people with knowledge of the conversation.</p>
<p>Breton told the world&#8217;s richest man he must adhere to a checklist of rules which are set out in the EU&#8217;s new Digital Services Act.</p>
<p>According to the report, these include a requirement to ditch an &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; approach to reinstating banned users and to agree to an &#8220;extensive independent audit&#8221; of the platform by next year.</p>
<p>The landmark law aims to set the global standard for how tech giants must police content on the internet.</p>
<p>In a readout of the conversation provided by Breton, he told Musk: &#8220;There is still huge work ahead, as Twitter will have to implement transparent user policies, significantly reinforce content moderation and protect freedom of speech, tackle disinformation with resolve, and limit targeted advertising.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The impressive incompetence of the &#8220;world&#8217;s richest man&#8221; continues to be staggeringly entertaining. I look forward to the incoherent tantrum that will be incoming.</p>

<p class="lead">Here in Minnesota, the most reliable supporters of Republicans are gun owners, hunters, and fishing fanatics. Even our Democratic governor made appeasing that demographic a key part of his electoral success, and I don&#8217;t mind &#8212; it&#8217;s a bridge to environmental action, you know. I also have roots in the Western US, where a major issue is individual liberty to use local resources.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an interesting case of <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/11/29/2139026/-A-phama-millionaire-is-suing-four-hunters-for-7-million-and-the-results-will-have-a-huge-impact"><em>private</em> interference in individual liberty</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>OnX is an app that’s intended to help hunters find public land so they can go after deer, elk, or whatever they happen to be hunting. At first glance, that may not seem like news, but users of that app get an invaluable view of just who owns the property around them, which is critical when trying to reach public lands where hunting is legal. They have also gotten a very clear view of something that is otherwise hidden from the public: how corporations, millionaires, and billionaires have blocked out huge chunks of public property so that they alone can access it—without paying a dime. </p>
<p>They do this by creating public land “islands,” areas that are surrounded by privately held property. The public lands in these islands become de facto parts of the surrounding property. In most states, there is absolutely no rule that says the property owners have to do anything to allow access to that island of land.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of their tactics is to divide the land into a checkerboard &#8212; squares of private ownership around public land that are in contact at only their corners. The rich want to make it illegal to step across any of those corners!</p>
<blockquote><p>Well aware of how prickly many land owners are about hunters crossing their property, Cape located an area of “checkerboard” control. That is, the land is divided into one mile-by-one mile sections, half of which are public property, half of which are privately owned, like the black and white squares on a checkboard.</p>
<p>At one place on this checkboard map, Eshelman controlled two squares that met at a corner. The other two squares were public property. Using OnX, Cape mapped out the exact location and led three friends in stepping across the corner from one public square to the other. They not only didn’t step on Eshelman’s land, the area of his property they crossed was infinitely small. Not one state has laws against this “corner crossing,” which is common in areas where grants of public land were once given to railroad companies in an effort to “open up” the West.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rich guy who has bought up these parcels of land, drug company executive Fredric Eshelman, is upset at this simple privilege. He&#8217;s an extraordinarily greedy person.</p>
<blockquote><p>Eshelman owns 23,277 acres near Elk Mountain, but in prosecuting this case against corner-crossing, he attempted to block access to 1.6 million acres of public land. </p></blockquote>
<p>So he&#8217;s suing four hunters who stepped across the mathematically infinitesimal corner boundary for <em>$7 million</em>. He lost a criminal trial against them &#8212; it would have been difficult to show that they&#8217;d deprived him of anything &#8212; so he&#8217;s making a civil case of it, and since he&#8217;s rich, he can harass the hunters with lawsuits until he wins. Sadly, people in Wyoming (Wyoming! Deeply Republican Wyoming!) think the hunters will eventually lose.</p>
<blockquote><p>No matter how ridiculous this may all seem, and no matter the quick outcome of the jury trial,  Wyoming officials are convinced that the landowners will win in the end. According to a Republican attorney who formerly worked for the state attorney general’s office, if the hunters win, “it would not surprise me at all that the Legislature would come back and pass a law saying corner crossing is illegal. It’s sort of if you win, you lose, and if you lose, you lose.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of case that ought to unite everyone, Republican rednecks, environmentalists, Democrats, people who want to look for spiders, just <em>everyone</em>, in opposing this scheme. I don&#8217;t like the idea that filthy rich assholes can wall off huge chunks of public land to create private game hunting parks for themselves. Unfortunately, there are also lots of ranchers who exploit the <a href="https://americanwildhorsecampaign.org/media/what-you-need-know-wyoming-checkerboard">Wyoming checkerboard</a> for their personal gain.</p>
<p>By the way, Eshelman is a hard right Republican donor.</p>

<p class="lead">As the general exodus from Twitter continues, new alternatives have been springing up. I&#8217;m using Mastodon, but I&#8217;ve also been seeing some attention paid to another option, an app called Post. I know nothing about it, but I was willing to give it a try, until I read <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/manifesting-history">more about where Post comes from</a>. The article was more about a tech journalist, Kara Swisher, who has been a cheerleader for Elon Musk until recently, when she&#8217;s been trying to bury her past sycophancy in a memory hole.</p>
<blockquote><p>Swisher also recently pushed people toward a new social network called “Post,” a site backed by Andreessen Horowitz. You may remember A16Z from last year, when they attempted to pump and dump worthless social network Clubhouse, while also aiding in the direct harassment of Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz (who was at the New York Times at the time). Worse still, on an episode of her Pivot podcast she admitted that she’s an advisor in Post, and that her co-host Scott Galloway is an investor. From what I can see, Swisher was pushing people toward a product &#8211; on November 17, and again November 21 &#8211; that she would only reveal her involvement with four days later.</p>
<p>Post has recently gained attention for claiming to “allow users to read premium news from multiple publishers,” only to offer you the chance to pay for news that is otherwise free elsewhere. And up until recently, Post had intimated that it was against their Terms of Service to make fun of people for their net worth.</p>
<p>Post cries for a return to civility, where the public squares are not quite as public and the powerful are not quite as criticized. Swisher benefits by being one of the biggest new names on a platform, hedging her bets against Twitter (note: Andreessen Horowitz financed part of the Twitter deal and general partner Sriram Krishnan temporarily helped out Musk in his first days at the company) at the time when it’s most convenient to do so.</p>
<p>It’s also a naked attempt by venture capital to recreate the world in their image, and it proves &#8211; as has been proven, as will be proven again &#8211; that these people have no idea how normal people act or what they want.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess I won&#8217;t bother with Post, then. Venture capitalists can get fucked.</p>
<p>Less novel, the article also has a nice rant against Elon Musk.</p>
<blockquote><p>As I’ve related above, Musk has been an irascible shithead for many years, but his overwhelming clout with the media meant that he could, effectively push through any idea his little mind desired. A flamethrower? Sure. $420 Tequila? Of course. Landing humans on Mars? He said 2022, but everybody was fine with saying “within five years” or “2029.”</p>
<p>Musk has gotten away with a mixture of half-truths and outright lies enough times that he believed that he had the popularity to do anything, another condition afflicted upon those with billions of dollars. When he bought Twitter, I truly think that he believed everybody would be behind him, because up until that point most of the media had been. Kara Swisher gave an interview in May about how smart Elon was. Jessica Lessin of The Information described the acquisition as “like watching a business school case study on how to make money on the internet.” Hell, he was able to con banks and investors into raising $13 billion for him. Musk still had the ability to manipulate the media &#8211; and still does, in the sense that he can still get a bunch of stories about literally anything he does &#8211; but couldn’t change the reality that he did not have a plan for the website that he tied his entire financial future to.</p>
<p>That’s why he seems so utterly pathetic. Musk may have had no plan, but he also appears to have never considered the eventuality that most people would dislike his choices. For someone supposedly tuned into “the future,” he continually fails to adapt to his changing circumstances, picking and losing fights and taking that as proof that his cause is just rather than his ideas being bad. And now his closest allies are wobbling sycophants like David Sacks, who accidentally ended up on the right side of the antitrust debate in an attempt to kiss up to his boss.</p>
<p>What we are likely seeing is society turning its backs on the ultra-rich, and are beginning to see that being able to spend a lot of money does not make someone smart, right or just. The common narrative of the abusively powerful is that they are victims, and that victimization is key to their narrative &#8211; except the last three years have chewed through much of the sympathy that a regular person would have for anyone with a billion dollars. It used to be convenient to kiss up to these people &#8211; comfortable, even &#8211; but “having a billion dollars” no longer guarantees that someone is worthy of adulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many, but not all, journalists have given Musk a free pass for years &#8212; I guess they were seduced by the prospect of access to a person with more money than sanity. The rest of us, including me, saw right through him, but then there wasn&#8217;t a chance we&#8217;d get any money from him, or even a dinner invitation. I am glad to see his reputation shrivel now, though.</p>

<p class="lead">Yet more <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/29/rhodes-oathkeepers-sedition-verdict-jan6/">good news</a>? Be still my heart.</p>
<blockquote><p>A federal jury on Tuesday convicted Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and a top deputy of seditious conspiracy for leading a months-long plot to unleash political violence to prevent the inauguration of President Biden, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p>
<p>The panel of seven men and five women deliberated for three days before finding Rhodes and lead Florida Oath Keeper Kelly Meggs guilty of conspiring to oppose by force the lawful transition of presidential power. But three other associates were not convicted of the historically rare and politically freighted sedition count. All five were convicted of obstructing Congress as it met to confirm the results of the 2020 election. Both offenses are punishable by up to 20 years in prison.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lock him up!</p>
<p>Although, I&#8217;m sad to say, it looks we can anticipate a little less happy news from these court cases in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rhodes and his co-defendants were the first accused of seditious conspiracy and the first to face trial and be convicted on any conspiracy charge to date in the massive Jan. 6 investigation. He is the highest-profile figure to face trial in connection with rioting by angry Trump supporters who injured scores of officers, ransacked offices and forced lawmakers to evacuate the U.S. Capitol.</p></blockquote>
<p>What? That angry dork is the &#8220;highest-profile figure&#8221; arrested in the insurrection plot? That doesn&#8217;t seem right. I can think of a few members of congress and one ex-president who ought to be on the docket.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering about the fierce pirate fashion statement, Rhodes did not lose an eye in gallant action. He dropped a loaded gun, it went off, and put out his eye. Yeah, he&#8217;s one of those bumbling gun-fondling dumb-asses.</p>

It&#8217;s amazing to me that this could be an issue anymore, but all the Democrats voted for it, and they persuaded 12 whole Republicans to join them. Twelve is looking at the glass as a quarter full, I guess; we could also note that 36 Republicans voted against it. We really have to get rid of those ugly antiques.</p>
<p>Now do the same thing and pass a federal law protecting abortion rights, OK?</p>

The latter book, published in 2017, won the Best Book of the Year award at the Zaporizhzhya Book Fair, and was shortlisted for numerous awards, including: LitAkcent Book of the Year, Lviv City of UNESCO Literary Award and the European Union Prize for Literature. </em></p> <p class="p3"><strong>Is Russia aiming to destroy Ukrainian culture?</strong></p> <p class="p4">Everyone was shocked when the Russians at the beginning of this war bombed the museum in Ivankiv, an urban settlement in the Kyiv Oblast. It contained the paintings of many famous artists, including the work of Maria Prymachenko. This is one of our worst fears. It&rsquo;s very painful to lose people in war, of course. But losing culture and history is a tragedy too. Russians keep trying to punish us for having this history, and for being Europeans.</p> <p class="p5">There was a poignant photo that emerged in the media after Russian troops left the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, back in late March. It showed a dead woman&rsquo;s hand, with a key chain next to it, which displayed a symbol of the European Union . . . She thought that the European Union was her home. But Europe did not save her.</p> <p class="p3"><strong>What is behind the efforts to undermine a distinct Ukrainian identity?</strong></p> <p class="p4">The Russian Federation hates Ukraine because the country has managed to become democratic. We have true elections. We are, you could say, obsessed about our freedom, and we&rsquo;re ready to die for it. Russians cannot forgive us for that.</p> <p class="p5">We now have a very black joke here in Ukraine that if we don&rsquo;t like some building, we should just write the word &ldquo;children&rdquo; on the building, because we know the Russians will destroy it. They act like terrorists. Russian officials keep warning Ukrainians that cities that do not surrender, like Kyiv and Lviv, will be completely destroyed, like Mariupol was. I&rsquo;m sure Russia will attempt to keep bombing our historical and cultural sites.</p> <p class="p3"><strong>Is there a historic precedent for this? </strong></p> <p class="p4">In the 1920s there was a renaissance of Ukrainian culture, which for some time the Soviet regime allowed to flourish. Ukrainians were able to publish texts, and plays were allowed to run in theatres. There was an apartment building where some of the best writers in Ukraine all lived: the Slovo building in Kharkiv. Most of its inhabitants have since become known as &ldquo;the Executed Renaissance&rdquo;. They were arrested by [the Soviet secret police] and executed. That wiped out about 90 per cent of the best writers in Ukraine.</p> <p class="p3"><strong>Has the Russian government acknowledged these past abuses? </strong></p> <p class="p4">[After the fall of the Soviet Union] there was no attempt to understand what went wrong in their history. On the contrary, the Russian government has prosecuted the few individuals who were brave enough to talk about shameful episodes of their history. Take, for example, the graves [of the executed Ukrainian writers]. A historian named Yury Dmitriev, who took care of these graves, was arrested. He is, I believe, currently still in prison in Russia.</p> <p class="p3"><strong>Why do so many Russians appear to believe the government&rsquo;s propaganda on Ukraine and its past?</strong></p> <p class="p4">The propaganda the Russian government uses is not even consistent. But Russians want to believe these lies. Unfortunately, the roots of it are very deep. They have an imperial mindset. This insinuates that it could not possibly be true that Ukrainians could have built a democratic state, or that they could have visa-free travel to Europe, or that Ukrainians are flourishing, and they are ready to be with Europe. It just doesn&rsquo;t fit into the picture of the world the Russians have. This is cognitive dissonance. They want to keep believing that they are saving the world. They believed they saved Georgia, after the 2008 invasion. <br>They did the same in Chechnya [with two wars there from 1994 to 2000], where Russia committed a genocide. Russians are proud of that. They cannot see what is wrong with <br>this history.</p> <p class="p3"><strong>Ukraine became part of the USSR in 1922 and independent in 1991. Meanwhile, its borders changed multiple times during Soviet rule. How do Ukrainians deal with that complicated history? </strong></p> <p class="p4">Under any [totalitarian] regime you get used to it, and you more than cooperate. You become part of this regime. In my novel <em>Dom&rsquo;s Dream Kingdom,</em> I used the story of my grandfather. He was a Soviet military pilot. He became part of the Soviet regime. But he was from the east of Ukraine, where the <em>Holodomor</em> [now recognised in Ukraine as an act of genocide] occurred. His family were victims of the that man-made famine, and he had terrible memories about that. I also remember my grandfather explaining to me the fear he felt if the Soviet army could potentially send him to Czechoslovakia in 1968.</p> <p class="p5">But regimes force people to do terrible things. As a Ukrainian I felt there was something wrong with that, and I should be somehow even ashamed. This is not what is happening in Russia today. There is no shame. They are proud of their victories, and they believe they&rsquo;re the <br>saviours of Europe.</p> <p class="p3"><strong>&ldquo;Dom&rsquo;s Dream Kingdom&rdquo; is set in Lviv, in the childhood home of science-fiction writer Stanislaw Lem. Why did you choose this setting?</strong></p> <p class="p4">It&rsquo;s important to talk first about the history of Lviv, after the Second World War, when the population changed drastically. In 1939 we had more than [150,000] Jews living in Lviv [then known by its Polish name, Lw&oacute;w]. After the war less than [one percent] of Jews survived. Stanislav Lem was a Polish author of Jewish origin. He suffered under Nazi occupation [and later went to Krakow in Poland]. He had survivor&rsquo;s guilt there for all his life.</p> <p class="p5">Researchers in Poland and Ukraine now point out that novels like <em>Solaris</em>, and other books written by Lem, were not just random fictional stories. They were, in a way, his attempt to understand what happened to him during those years of occupations. Because the Lviv Lem lived under had three occupations. The Soviet Union occupied Lviv in 1939. Then the Nazis occupied the city in [June 1941]. Then the Soviets once again [in 1944].</p> <p class="p3"><strong>The 2014 Euromaidan revolution was a turning point for Ukraine, and your novel &ldquo;Fall Syndrome&rdquo; explores the lead-up to it. What changed?</strong></p> <p class="p4">In 2014 we stopped having doubts about ourselves as Ukrainians. I was born in 1986, the year Chernobyl happened. As a child I witnessed the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was one thing in 1991, when the majority of Ukrainians voted for being independent. But it was drastically different when we were ready to fight for it in 2014. When Russia then started a war immediately after that [in eastern Ukraine] we showed that we would not support a puppet government in Kyiv.</p> <p class="p5">But what&rsquo;s happening now is the Russians showing their true face. They show they are ready to kill women and children, and then pretend afterwards that it didn&rsquo;t happen. It&rsquo;s yet another level. I don&rsquo;t know what will happen tomorrow.</p> <p class="p3"><strong>You work closely with PEN Ukraine. What does your work involve? </strong></p> <p class="p4">Right now, PEN Ukraine is helping to evacuate writers from certain parts of Ukraine, where their lives are in danger. I am part of the so-called PEN security initiative that is helping with this. I have been reiterating the same point since the war began, when talking to an international <br>audience:</p> <p class="p5">I know you support us in Ukraine now, but please, stay with us &ndash; not for a day, not for a week, not for a month, stay with us until victory, or until we are all dead, because this is what is at stake, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/shamsie.jpg" height="500" alt="Kamila Shamsie's 'Best of Friends'" width="500"></strong></p> <p><strong>Best of Friends</strong> (Bloomsbury) by Kamila Shamsie</p> <p>Kamila Shamsie&rsquo;s blazing 2017 novel <em>Home Fire</em>, winner of the Woman&rsquo;s Prize and longlisted for the Booker, is a contemporary retelling of Sophocles&rsquo; play Antigone; an account of radicalisation and Islamophobia from the perspective of a Muslim family navigating life in Britain. <br><br><em>Best of Friends</em> is a more introspective work, looking at the decades-long friendship of two women who move from Karachi to London. In terms of tension, it&rsquo;s a slow burn. The book is divided into two parts. The first depicts their adolescence at a prestigious school in Karachi in the 1980s where their attachment is first cemented and tested. Their school years are set against the backdrop of President Zia&rsquo;s dictatorship and abrupt death and the rise of Benazir Bhutto, who becomes the country&rsquo;s first female prime minister in 1988. <br><br>While Maryam is nonchalant about her studies, Zahra is bookish and works hard. Maryam&rsquo;s family is well-off and she has the self-assurance of the entitled, safe in the knowledge that she will inherit the family business from her grandfather one day (she doesn&rsquo;t). Zahra&rsquo;s family are not as affluent or well-connected. Shamsie focuses on a single defining experience: the &ldquo;girlfear&rdquo; the friends feel as teenagers when they are taken on a dangerous joy ride by two young men. <br><br>Thirty years later, Shamsie uses the device of a <em>Guardian</em> feature and a media profile to demonstrate the friends&rsquo; successful integration in London. Zahra has become the director of a well-known civil liberties group and Maryam is a top venture capitalist. Maryam swiftly recognises: &ldquo;England taught you the subtleties of language &ndash; &lsquo;When did you arrive here?&rsquo; was something you never wanted to hear; &lsquo;When did you move here?&rsquo; was fine. The movers had options, the arrivers simply followed a trajectory out of a hellhole and washed up on some better shore.&rdquo; Maryam and Zahra clearly represent the immigrants Britain welcomes. It&rsquo;s a subject Shamsie knows well (she moved to London in 2007 and is now a dual national) and pertinent observations like these are threaded through the novel. <br><br>Maryam courts the British government for her own ends, whereas Zahra tries to expose its shortcomings. Their different moral outlooks are spotlit when Zahra tries to help someone legitimately obtain leave to remain. She is horrified by the conditions of the deportation centre she visits. By contrast, Maryam pulls strings to gets an enemy from their past deported.<br><br>Shamsie&rsquo;s exposure of the UK&rsquo;s immigration system is as acute and damning as her exploration of counter-terrorism policies in <em>Home Fire</em>. She highlights the government&rsquo;s hypocritical acceptance of successful migrants, and disdain for those who are of no financial value. Pakistan and Britain may be worlds apart politically but, as Shamsie slyly suggests, when the ruling class let inequality, cronyism and corruption take root, these divisions narrow.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition.</em><em> <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="The Prince of Wales and the Queen in Westminster Abbey, 1975" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/charles.jpg" height="923" alt="The Prince of Wales and the Queen, 1975" width="1300"></p> <p>If the establishment of the Church is not often on display to the British public, it certainly was during the accession of King Charles III. Around the country, as public authorities proclaimed the King&rsquo;s accession, God and the Church of England have been not just prominent, but very often presiding. Charles was proclaimed king &ldquo;by the Grace of God&rdquo;, and after much speculation, it has been confirmed that he will bear the title &ldquo;Defender of the Faith&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;Defender of Faith&rdquo; as some (though not him) had suggested. Like almost all English monarchs in the 500 years since it was first awarded, he will bear the traditional title of the supreme governor of the Church of England.<br><br>But for the first time in recent history, the Church of which the new monarch is the supreme governor is not the Church of their subjects. Most of those subjects don&rsquo;t even believe in God. Putting aside doctrine and practice (which has never been a majority activity), when Queen Elizabeth II acceded to the throne, most of her subjects in Britain probably at least identified as Anglicans and certainly looked to that Church for life events such as weddings and funerals. <br><br>In 2022, only 12 per cent of the new king&rsquo;s British subjects say they are Anglicans, most funerals are non-religious, and only 10 per cent of weddings are Anglican. Being a committed Anglican no longer makes a monarch of like mind and habit with their people; it sets them apart.<br><br>Does this matter? Those from the &ldquo;No God, No Master&rdquo; school of the humanist tradition will give a resounding &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ndash; down with the whole lot and a secular republic yesterday, please! But there is an arguable rational basis for a constitutional monarchy, and so there are others who would like a monarchy they can support with a clear conscience and which can play a unifying role.<br><br>In any case, whether you have a rational preference for continued monarchy or not, all but the most optimistic republican must admit that we are likely to live within a constitutional monarchy for the foreseeable future. So the question is relevant: can a monarch coming to the throne today plausibly be a national figurehead at the same time as being entangled by law with a religious institution which is alien to nearly 9 in 10 of their people? Is this compatible with our diverse and mostly non-religious society?<br><br>First of all, we should distinguish the personal religious commitments of the monarch from their institutional role. Obviously it is true that a man of personal religious convictions can be head of state and protect freedom of belief for all. At an international conference on global freedom of religion or belief, when still Prince of Wales, King Charles gave one of the most humanistic speeches I have heard at such an event in nearly 20 years. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>. . . a diversity of voices and interests is absolutely essential, if we are to achieve our shared goal of ensuring that everyone everywhere is able to follow their chosen religion or belief in peace and safety. Freedom of conscience, of thought and of belief is central to any truly flourishing society. It allows people to contribute to their communities without fear of exclusion, to exchange ideas without fear of prejudice and to build relationships without fear of rejection. A society where difference is respected, where it is accepted that all need not think alike, will benefit from the talents of all its members. Where there is discrimination, we know only too well, there is disempowerment, darkness and division.</p> </blockquote> <p>I spoke in the same opening session of that conference and said practically the same thing. So it is clear that people of good will can speak the same language in respect of human rights and freedom of belief. We are not asking if a Christian in public life can defend and guarantee freedom of belief for all. What we are really asking is whether a monarch who must also be the supreme governor, defender and promoter of the Church of England can.</p> <p>The King clearly believes these two roles are compatible. In a speech to selected religious leaders shortly after his accession, he affirmed that his oath to maintain the Church of England existed for him alongside the &ldquo;duty to protect the diversity of our country&rdquo;. He vowed to &ldquo;respect those who follow other spiritual paths as well as those who live their lives in accordance with secular ideals&rdquo;. Like his speech to the international ministerial, his words were ones to gladden any humanist:</p> <blockquote> <p>The beliefs that flourish in, and contribute to, our richly diverse society differ. They, and our society, can only thrive through a clear collective commitment to those vital principles of freedom of conscience, generosity of spirit and care for others which are, to me, the essence of our nationhood. I am determined, as King, to preserve and promote those principles across all communities, and for all beliefs, with all my heart.</p> </blockquote> <p>These words must be the most progressive and inclusive ever voiced by a British monarch. In contrast, at her jubilee in 2012, Queen Elizabeth II spoke of &ldquo;the significant position of the Church of England in our nation&rsquo;s life&rdquo;:</p> <blockquote> <p>The concept of our established Church is occasionally misunderstood and, I believe, commonly under-appreciated. Its role is not to defend Anglicanism to the exclusion of other religions. Instead, the Church has a duty to protect the free practice of all faiths in this country . . . gently and assuredly, the Church of England has created an environment for other faith communities and indeed people of no faith to live freely.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was clearly an attempt to depict a &ldquo;hospitable&rdquo; establishment, and to say that a liberal state Church can mediate the diversity of contemporary society. But are such statements enough? Can freedom of religion or belief truly exist in a society with an established state religion &ndash; even if that religion purports to be a protector of all religions or beliefs? Even historians friendly to the Church have analysed its actions in past years as attempts to preserve its own power. The King&rsquo;s inclusion of &ldquo;secular ideals&rdquo; in his remarks following his accession was welcome, but no one with these ideals was invited to hear them &ndash; only religious representatives were.</p> <h2>Power and exclusion</h2> <p>Of course, today&rsquo;s Church of England is not the wannabe theocracy of previous centuries. From the late 17th to late 19th centuries, other groups gradually acquired equality before the law with Anglicans: first all non-Anglican Protestants, then Roman Catholics, Jews and the non-religious. In the 21st century, equality laws deriving from Europe have been incorporated into UK law in a way that has reduced and in some cases outlawed discrimination on grounds of religion or belief. In 1998, the Human Rights Act gave us all the statutory right to freedom of religion or belief for the first time. <br><br>But the established status of the Church still exerts a pernicious effect in the UK. One in five schools in England and Wales is run by the Church of England, allowed to legally discriminate against children on the basis of beliefs they are too young to hold for themselves. Twenty-six unelected bishops sit in our legislature, able to vote on legislation. This globally egregious set-up has a negative influence on British politics. The Church is a fierce lobbyist for religious privilege, from laws allowing religious parents priority access to certain state-funded schools, and laws mandating Christian worship in all state schools, to laws allowing religious discrimination in the provision of public services. The UN and other human rights bodies have highlighted these features of the UK as incompatible with freedom of religion or belief.</p> <p>Can a head of state uphold one while still defending the other? On a symbolic level, the idea of a &ldquo;hospitable establishment&rdquo; sets up unpleasant dynamics of power and exclusion. In this context, we non-Anglicans are guests, not homeowners. &ldquo;Toleration&rdquo; is not the same as inclusion and empowerment. This is most uncomfortable at moments of national or public ceremony, which are routinely presided over by the priests of the Church. One litmus test for the extent to which the monarchy will be serious about reflecting today&rsquo;s Britain or not would of course be the coronation, which &ndash; it has already been confirmed &ndash; will be an Anglican ceremony.<br><br>In 2015, I was a member of the Commission of Religion and Belief in British Public Life, which made the recommendation that &ldquo;All those responsible for national and civic events, whether in the public sphere or in Church, including the Coronation, should ensure that the pluralist character of modern society is reflected.&rdquo; This was a mild recommendation from my point of view. In 2018 Bob Morris of the UCL constitution unit recommended a secular ceremony in Westminster Hall as part of the coronation. That seems to me a minimum requirement. The 2012 Olympic opening ceremony was widely seen as a successful modern ceremony that modelled the diversity of society as well as the core values that unite us. Ceremonies around the commencement of a new reign &ndash; a much more significant moment in our national life &ndash; are surely an opportunity for new symbolism, making a statement about inclusion and the importance of freedom of religion or belief for all.</p> <h2>An opportunity for change</h2> <p>The House of Windsor is the last European royal family to practise coronations. The others have either replaced them with simpler ceremonies or never practised them in the first place. Most monarchies today only require a simple oath to be taken in the presence of the country&rsquo;s legislature. <br>In the Netherlands, which has a secular state with clear separation of religious and political authorities, King Willem-Alexander, personally a Protestant, was sworn in at a ceremony in 2013 in the Nieuwe Kerk, a decommissioned church. The ceremony took place in a joint session of the two Houses of Parliament. The King was confirmed in office and swore to be faithful to the Constitution and to discharge the duties of his office. In Belgium, King Philippe&rsquo;s ceremony involved only a solemn oath to &ldquo;abide by the constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, maintain the country&rsquo;s independence and preserve its territory&rdquo; before members of the two Houses of Parliament.<br><br>Even states with established Churches don&rsquo;t involve elaborate religious rituals. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, whose established Church is almost as entangled with the constitution as that of England, was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace in 1972 by the Prime Minister with no formal enthronement. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden chose not to be crowned in 1973, but simply took office during a meeting of the cabinet and, afterwards, was enthroned in a simple ceremony in the Royal Palace.</p> <p>Change is possible, and has occurred in recent eras. Charles III&rsquo;s great-grandfather presided over the end of the established Church in Wales; his great-great-great-grandmother was the last monarch of an established Church in Ireland; even his late mother was only &ldquo;Defender of the Faith&rdquo; in Australia until the 1970s when the title was abolished there. Being supreme governor of the Church has not always required committed Anglicanism. Lutherans, Catholics and monarchs whose private commitments we shall never know have all held the title. There is enough flexibility in principle for a new coronation and a new reign to herald a larger vision.<br><br>You might not think this matters much. I said earlier that there was a rational case for monarchy &ndash; but I think it is fair to say that most people&rsquo;s support for the institution is emotional. Most people don&rsquo;t concern themselves with academic questions of constitutional nicety or with religious questions. Why not just keep them all in a box marked &ldquo;tradition&rdquo;? <br><br>But this misses an opportunity to say something genuinely meaningful to the people of this country. We are undoubtedly a largely pro-monarchy country. But the British public don&rsquo;t value monarchy because the monarch is Defender of the Faith. They value it because they see it as a stabiliser and unifier during difficult times. Its symbolic events provide an opportunity to come together and express national identity in the 21st century. If that role is to continue, those opportunities need to change just as much as our identity has.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="K-pop band BTS are kings of South Korea's soft power" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/BTS.jpeg" height="585" alt="K-pop group BTS" width="1024"></p> <p class="p1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Gangnam Style&rsquo; is a socio-cultural commentary on South Korea&rsquo;s hyper-consumerism and material pursuit&rdquo; reads the label next to a glass case containing a pink suit. The outfit belongs to the pop star Psy, who made the song and accompanying dance world famous (the &ldquo;Gangnam Style&rdquo; music video was the first YouTube clip to earn over a billion views). That was back in 2012. Now Korean popular culture &ndash; the <em>hallyu</em> or so-called Korean Wave &ndash; has earned its own exhibition in the UK&rsquo;s prestigious V&amp;A Museum in London.</p> <p class="p2">There is something delightful about imagining the curators working out how to word the labels for this collection of artefacts: a range of early video games reveals the pioneering spirit of early web caf&eacute; culture, cute outfits like Psy&rsquo;s are displayed, while their pop songs play on multiple screens. The exhibition sums up K-pop as: &ldquo;adored worldwide for its polished performances that blend catchy tunes and heartening lyrics, stunning visuals and powerful dance steps.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p2">You may not need the V&amp;A to tell you that K-pop now has a global reach, or to recognise the faces of these pretty, androgynous stars. In October, the BBC World Service led with news that the members of BTS &ndash; the south Korean boy band &ndash; were going to do their military service and would not be exempt. The possibility had been discussed, due to their contribution to Korea&rsquo;s global standing; they have even addressed the United Nations general assembly.</p> <p class="p2">South Korea has not just re-branded itself, but built global economic success on its popular culture. Given that the three decades after the Korean War ended in 1953 were marked by political repression meted out by the paramilitary government, this was a remarkable transformation. In the 1990s, South Korea transitioned from autocracy to democracy. The strategy of promoting culture appears to have been triggered by striking economic data: in 1993, the film <em>Jurassic Park</em> earned more money in South Korea than the major car manufacturer Hyundai. One can&rsquo;t help wondering if this promotion of culture might also have helped to harness the energy of South Korea&rsquo;s young population, and embed its new democratic identity.</p> <p class="p2">The success of South Korea&rsquo;s policy extends to cinema (Oscar-winning <em>Parasite</em> and <em>Minari</em>) and television (<em>Squid</em> <em>Game</em>), following years of critical acclaim for directors such as Park Chan Wook (<em>Oldboy</em>) and Bong Joon-ho, whose films <em>The Host</em> and <em>Snowpiercer</em> won him global fans before <em>Parasite</em> got its three Oscars.</p> <p class="p2">Is there a lesson for the UK? Cultural leaders in Britain from screen, stage and the music industry have been pleading for years for the Conservative government to recognise the significant value of the export earnings of British culture, along with the boon to tourism. They pleaded for better support for the arts during the pandemic lockdowns, only to be answered by the government&rsquo;s much-mocked skills retraining poster campaign, apparently suggesting that ballet dancers might instead find a job &ldquo;in cyber&rdquo;, whatever that might mean.</p> <p class="p2">Education policy, too, has been re-angled to emphasise the funding of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) as if they were in a competition with the humanities. Music, drama and language provision in state schools is plummeting. All of which gives the impression that the British government is either oblivious or tone deaf to the economic value of our creative industries.</p> <p class="p4">That&rsquo;s not to say all is rosy in the world of the Korean Wave. K-pop acts are formed like a factory product: from their teenage years, artists are drilled and groomed into a uniform standard of beauty. While the likes of BTS may be speaking up about climate change and LGBTQ+ pride, there is something unsettling about the image of perfection their fans aspire to emulate.</p> <p class="p2">South Korea is a world leader in something less savoury than cultural exports, too. It has the highest rate of cosmetic surgeries in the world, with an estimated one in three South Korean women under 30 having procedures.</p> <p class="p2">Even so, there is a frankness in South Korean culture about the dark side of its success. One of the most powerful exhibits in the V&amp;A exhibition is the ugly set of the basement flat from <em>Parasite</em> &ndash; semi-underground &ndash; typical of those in which many poor urban families live.</p> <p class="p2">What is inspiring is how South Korea has dared to see the value of storytelling and song. The country has built a cultural and economic force out of the power of its citizens to dream; whatever darkness, as well as beauty, those dreams might reveal.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
