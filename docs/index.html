            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">I was intrigued by a question I was asked on my last livestream, and I decided to track it down. The question:</p>
<p>Who is Gilbert Ling?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be put off by the howling winds at the beginning &#8212; I went into a nice quiet room for the rest of it. If even that is too annoying for you, just read my rough script, below the fold.</p>
<p><span id="more-68270"></span></p>
<p>Last week, I had a livestream in which I got some questions and comments. I was asked a question that caught me by surprise: &#8220;have you heard of Gilbert Ling?&#8221;<br />
I had to admit that no, I&#8217;d never heard of him, and hadn&#8217;t the slightest idea who he was.<br />
Later, I looked him up. Then I jumped down the rabbit hole, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll summarize today.<br />
I&#8217;ll start with some positives before I talk about how he turned into a tedious crackpot.</p>
<p>Ling was clearly a brilliant man. He was born in China in 1919, studied physics and chemistry in the 1940s, a time when China was struggling with the bloody Japanese invasion. He won a prestigious and highly competitive scholarship to come to America and do advanced studies at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>There he worked with Ralph Gerard to perfect the capillary microelectrode, which was for a time called the Gerard-Graham-Ling microelectrode. This is an indispensible tool in cell and membrane physiology, and this was the first time I&#8217;d heard any names associated with it; it&#8217;s ubiquitous and taken for granted, so we just call it a microelectrode, no honorifics.</p>
<p>His first GOOD idea was working with Ralph Gerard and figuring out how to reliably make these useful glass electrodes.</p>
<p>What it is is an extraordinarily tiny glass needle. They&#8217;re made by taking thin-walled glass tubing, heating it, and then drawing it out to produce a fine, tapered tip. How tiny? The point of the needle is smaller than a wavelength of visible light, so all you see in a microscope is a diffracted blur, and it&#8217;s so sharp that you can stick it through the membrane of a single cell without destroying it. You can then use it to measure voltages and currents across the membrane, or to inject small molecules into the cell, or you can use it as knife to do microsurgery.</p>
<p>In my post-doctoral work, for instance, I started every morning by making a dozen or so microelectrodes and filling them with a dye, Lucifer Yellow, and then spending the day sitting down at a microscope, pinning down grasshopper embryos, clamping a microelectrode to a micromanipulator, and microinjecting single cells with glowing fluorescent dyes. So I can be appreciative of the fact that Ling helped develop this incredibly useful tool when he was a graduate student. Thanks, Dr Ling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his career takes a dismal turn after that high point. He has written extensively and repeatedly about what I consider his Crackpot Origin Story, the moment when he turned to the loony side, and here it is. It was a failed grad student seminar.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a spring afternoon in 1947, I was standing on the podium in the main lecture room of the Department, waiting for my late-coming audience to settle down. The title of my talk was “The Sodium Pump.”<br />
I began with an apology. I told my audience that even though I had thoroughly searched the libraries, I had no worthwhile information on the sodium pump to share. It was just a name. I then went on to other related issues. When I finally stepped down from the podium, I was startled by what happened next. Two of my highly respected professors each individually took me aside and used almost the same words to tell me “ Gilbert, you don’t want to make yourself a martyr. Leave the sodium pump alone. It is a sacred cow.” I thanked both warmly for their concern about my personal welfare. At the same time, I also felt that they overly worried. Next thing you know, I was doing some simple bread-and-butter experiments to test the validity of the membrane (pump) theory.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a remarkable claim at an interesting time. In the 1930s, Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley had begun their biophysical research on the electrical properties of the cell membrane, and had hypothesized that those properties were a product of ion fluxes across the membrane via regulated and specific channels, driven by  gradients of concentration differences, with the interior of the cell being low in sodium and high in potassium, and conversely, the exterior environment being high in sodium and low in potassium. They postulated the existence of the ion channels and the sodium pump, but this being well before the development of molecular biology, the actual proteins involved had not been isolated and characterized. It was a sound hypothesis, though, backed up by a solid theoretical framework and many observations of the behavior of ions in isolated cellular preparations.</p>
<p>Their work was interrupted by World War II, but resumed promptly afterwards in one of the best known and most successful scientific collaborations of all time.  They would publish their  Hodgkin-Huxley model in the early 1950s, a mathematical description of how changing conductances in the membrane that produced action potentials in nerve and muscle fibers, and would  win the Nobel Prize in 1963. It is an extremely powerful predictive model for how the electrical activity in cells is generated, and has been tested over and over again, and is so successful it&#8217;s mostly taken for granted now. It just works.</p>
<p>Be warned, a theme is developing. All these people who had ideas contradicting Ling are going to be winning Nobel prizes. Man, that must have burned.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s Ling in 1947, after the preliminary work had been done and before the grand theory of the Hodgkin-Huxley model had been validated, standing up and boldly declaring that a key piece of the model was nonexistent, and further that the scientific literature was entirely lacking in worthwhile information about it. Yikes. He was wrong that there was nothing in the libraries about it &#8212; there was over a decade of research that demonstrated its existence mathematically and with data about the distribution of ions &#8212; but OK, it&#8217;s 1947, he&#8217;s in that awkward gap between preliminary prediction and physical confirmation. Even in 1947, though, he&#8217;s bucking against the evidence, and his professors know it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t trust Ling&#8217;s characterization of their response. What I suspect was going on was that his professors were more aware of the evidence than he was, that they knew what data was coming down the pike, and were trying to warn him against unwarranted arrogance.</p>
<p>That arrogance is his downfall. He spends the rest of his career cobbling up theories to demonstrate that the sodium pump doesn&#8217;t exist and couldn&#8217;t exist, even as the rest of the scientific community was triumphantly demonstrating its existence. The pump itself, the sodium-potassium ATPase, was isolated and characterized in 1957 by the Danish scientist Jens Christian Skou. Right up to the time of his death in 2019, Ling was still calling it the &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; sodium pump and was denying its existence. I think he refused to accept that he could have been wrong in 1947, and his hubris blighted his entire scientific career. He might have been brilliant, but his ego sidetracked him permanently.</p>
<p>What interested me is how someone could deny the overwhelming evidence for the &#8220;membrane (pump) theory&#8221; as he called it. I should be used to this now after years of confronting people who deny evolution. What&#8217;s unique here is that Ling didn&#8217;t build his ideas on a religious presupposition, but assembled increasingly absurd, contrived models for how the cell works to, I think, shelter his ego. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting, his bizarre explanations for how cells generate concentration differences without a pump. So let&#8217;s take a quick look at that.</p>
<p>We can distill it down to a simple fact that is not in contention, that Ling agrees to.  Cells have a strong concentration difference in select ions across the membrane: sodium, to name one, is high outside the cell and low inside. How does that happen? The prevailing explanation before Ling&#8217;s seminar, and since ever more strongly confirmed, is that there is a pump in the membrane that burns ATP for energy and exchanges sodium for potassium. Simple, right? And we now know that this pump is a physical protein that has all the properties predicted for it.</p>
<p>The question then, is what will Ling propose as an alternative. How do you generate a concentration difference without pushing ions around? He came up with something he called the Association-Induction Hypothesis.</p>
<p>One of his first assumptions is that the cytoplasm of the cell is highly structured, a gel-like matrix of proteins that make the inside of the cell less fluid and more like gelatin than a bag of water. This is valid! I don&#8217;t know anyone who would question that. It&#8217;s what I teach, and have for decades. So far, so good.</p>
<p>The next claim: that the water in the cell is also highly structured. It forms strong ASSOCIATIONS (that&#8217;s half the name) with the proteins in the cell and is no longer fluid. Then, because water is a dipole, its electrical properties INDUCE (there&#8217;s the second half) changes in the charge distribution in their associated proteins. Now we&#8217;re on shaky ground &#8212; the idea that water molecules have structure and align themselves to the environment isn&#8217;t weird, but the conclusions he draws are.</p>
<p>According to Ling, as a consequence of these changes in the cytoplasmic proteins, potassium is attracted to and is bound to the interior of the cell, displacing sodium to the outside. No pump is required, the ions flow in response to the chemistry of the cell to spontaneously generate the concentration difference.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all nonsense, I&#8217;m sorry to say. Water does form structured relationships with proteins and carbohydrates and lipids in the cell, but they&#8217;re transient and exhibit a great deal of flux. Water is not locked up in any way by those structures; it still flows fluidly within the matrix of material. Ling tries to argue that no, water is trapped and unable to flow in the way the &#8220;membrane (pump) theory&#8221; expects by making an analogy.  He compares a sponge and hamburger.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everybody knows what a raw hamburger is like. From its rich water content, it resembles a wet sponge. Yet it is also quite different from a wet sponge. Squeeze a wet sponge, water comes out. Squeeze harder, more water comes out until finally the sponge becomes almost dry. If instead, you take a raw hamburger and try to squeeze the water out from this water-rich material, you will find that it is well nigh impossible to squeeze any water out even after the meat has been chopped into tiny pieces. Indeed we carried on this line of inquiry in a more rigorously controlled manner.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So this exceedingly simple experiment adds yet another set of evidence showing without ambiguity that the basic tenet of free water in membrane-pump theory is wrong. The cell water cannot be normal liquid water. Were the cell water truly normal liquid water, it would have been extracted along with the indisputably normal liquid water (held in between the muscle cells), which is quantitatively squeezed out. What remains would be nothing more than dried proteins like a fully-squeezed out sponge. But that does not happen while the cells are still alive or close to being alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a few problems with this rationalization. The first is that it is an invalid analogy incorrectly interpreted. The second is that he&#8217;s reduced to trying to dismiss the mathematics and data of Hodgkin and Huxley with a clumsy analogy.</p>
<p>It is true that squeezing a lump of hamburger will not produce as much water as squeezing an equivalent lump of sponge with the same water content, but that&#8217;s not because water is so tightly bound in the hamburger. It&#8217;s a difference in the compressibility of the matrix. The sponge contains large voids full of water surrounded by relatively elastic fibers, and can be crushed down to a much smaller volume. The lump of meat contains many proteins with numerous but much smaller micro-spaces for water. It&#8217;s far less compressible, so you can&#8217;t easily squeeze out the water. But that does not mean water is unable to flow in the tissue, or that it&#8217;s not &#8220;normal liquid water&#8221;! In fact, fluid flow through cells is surprisingly dynamic.</p>
<p>Remember when I was making all those microelectrodes and filling them with a fluorescent dye? What I&#8217;d do was poke that needle into a single cell and then use a little current to inject a small amount of dye into the cell; It would then flow almost instantly throughout the cell, even into fine dendrites. It would do so within seconds. The gel-like consistency of the cytoplasm doesn&#8217;t seem to inhibit the free movement of water, ions, and small molecules.</p>
<p>Ling also has an unusual perspective on another molecule, ATP. The rest of the world thinks of ATP as a molecule that mediates the transfer of phosphate bonds to other molecules, as an intracellular signaling molecule, as an energy carrier that can be cleaved by hydrolysis to release energy that can drive other chemical reactions. Wrong, you fools.  It&#8217;s job is to act as an adsorbent, to bind water and induce it into an active state.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus far we have dealt with the &#8220;associative&#8221; aspect of the association-induction hypothesis. Equally important is the &#8220;inductive &#8221; aspect, or electrical polarization. Thus in the AI Hypothesis, the living cell is essentially an electronic machine, where the electronic perturbations are not carried out through long-range ohmic conduction of free electrons along electric wires but by a falling-domino-like propagated short-range interaction. In the association-induction hypothesis, it is this basic electronic mechanism which not only permits such key component, referred to as cardinal adsorbents, to sustain the protoplasm&#8212;of closely associated proteins-ion-water system&#8212;in its normal resting living state. It also provides the mechanism for cardinal adsorbents to control the reversible shifts between active and resting state. The cardinal adsorbent par excellence is the ultimate metabolic product, ATP.</p>
<p>This ubiquitous and crucial small molecule was once wrongly believed to carry an extra energy in the so-called high-energy-phosphate bonds. However, there is no doubt that ATP is strongly adsorbed on certain key sites (cardinal sites) on cell proteins. Indeed, the adsorption energy of ATP on the muscle protein, myosin, even exceeds what was once (wrongly) assigned as phosphate bond energy and this high adsorption energy fits like hand in glove in its central role in polarizing the protein-water-ion system maintaining the assembly in the living state.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t ask me to explain that diagram, it&#8217;s a vague mess. And that&#8217;s a lot of gibberish that ignores the importance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in metabolic processes. But it leads into his next bold claim, that the difference between living and dead is how their water is structured.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note also, the concept of the &#8220;living state&#8221;, despite its occasional plebeian usage by other investigators, is uniquely a concept of the AI Hypothesis. Being in the living state specifies what is living. Transition into the dead state specifies what is dead. In the living state, all the major components exist in their closely associated high (negative) energy and low entropy state. In the dead state, water and ions are to a large extent liberated and exist as free water and free ions, with a large entropy gain. In death, the proteins enter an internally neutralized state.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, there is no corresponding concept of what is living and what is not living in the membrane-pump theory.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess hamburger must be alive, then.</p>
<p>There is a strong element of jealousy and resentment in his tirades. He&#8217;s irate that Skau, who I mentioned earlier for his work in identifying the sodium-potassium ATPase, the pump, won a Nobel prize for his work. They passed over Ling! He doesn&#8217;t like the chemiosmotic hypothesis, which explains how mitochondria use proton gradients &#8212; and proton pumps! &#8212; to drive ATP synthase and make ATP, which is only an adsorbent anyhow, and thinks the Nobel committee was discredited by giving a Nobel to something that is only a hypothesis.</p>
<blockquote><p>A Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded in 1978 to English scientist, Peter Mitchell for his &#8220;Chemiosmotic Hypothesis&#8221;. To award a Nobel Prize for an (as-yet-unproven) hypothesis is unheard of. To the best of my knowledge and barring this one, no Noble Prizes has ever been given to authors of hypotheses before they had been proven valid beyond question. The Chemiosmotic Hypothesis was intended to provide a mechanism for the postulated membrane pumps. But Mitchell seemed totally ignorant of the vast amount of experimental evidence against the very existence of such membrane pumps. To what extent he was a victim of Glynn and Karlish&#8217;s &#8220;cooked&#8221; review and other &#8220;cooked&#8221; reviews like it-in which all evidence against the most prominent (sodium) pump was completely left out&#8212; I have no way of knowing. Not surprisingly, the Chemiosmotic theory soon became the target of one disproof after another. But for the reputation and credibility of the Nobel Prize as well as Peter Mitchell, these disproofs came too late. The Prize had already been awarded.</p></blockquote>
<p>The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been thoroughly tested experimentally and is still holding up just fine. It was more than just a hypothesis: Mitchell and his colleague Moyle had demonstrated it with multiple elegant experiments. It was far more rigorous than Ling&#8217;s wild ideas.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also mad because the NIH long ago stopped funding his crackpot research, which is particularly awful because…we still haven&#8217;t cured cancer or AIDS. The reason: because researchers haven&#8217;t adopted his Association-Induction Hypothesis.</p>
<blockquote><p>One result of this foot-dragging is that the Wars on cancer, AIDS and other deadly disease have not been guided by a correct cell physiology. Worse, they have been misguided by a wrong one. The reader can figure out for himself/herself the horrendous cost which must be paid for this foot-dragging, recalling that on an average day, one thousand and five hundred men, women and children die from cancer in America alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s what sour grapes looks like.</p>
<p>Ling died a few years ago, which means that this foolishness is going to fade away, right? Sorry, no. This kind of stuff is contagious &#8212; whereever grifters lurk, you&#8217;ll find people eager to embrace anything that denies conventional science, so that they can replace it with their patent nonsense. What&#8217;s handy about Ling&#8217;s ideas is that he rejects the role of those pesky proteins in cellular metabolism and makes it all about … water. Structured water. Water is cheap, its structure is invisible, the opportunities for profit are immense.  Get ready for a familiar con.</p>
<blockquote><p> We are studying the central role of water in health. We are two-thirds water &#8212; by volume. In terms of the percentage of molecules, that two-thirds figure computes to a lot of water molecules: more than 99% of our molecules are water molecules. Evidence suggests that those 99% don&#8217;t merely sit as the background carriers of the more important molecules of life, but are central participants. All that the cell does depends on water.<br />
…<br />
That leads to the hypothesis that proper hydration is a central feature of function, and therefore of health.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Those are the words of Gerald Pollack, a professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Washington who has bought into Ling&#8217;s notions wholesale. I actually agree with all that: we are mostly water, most of the chemistry of cells involves water, it&#8217;s a good idea to stay hydrated. However, Pollack takes a long step beyond the evidence. He claims to have discovered a new form of water, H3O2, that he calls EZ Water, short for Exclusion Zone Water. He thinks it is a specially structured water that forms wherever water contacts materials, and is also an intermediate step in the conversion of liquid water to ice, and is enriched in glacial melt water.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be impressed by the fact that he won an Emoto Prize. That&#8217;s a prize handed out by Masaru Emoto, the guy who had a period of some fame for his claim that talking to, or thinking at, or showing pictures to a glass of water would cause it to form appropriate ice crystals when frozen. Think nice thoughts at it, you get esthetically pleasing ice crystals; think negatively, and you get ugly crystals.</p>
<p>Alarm bells should be ringing in your head already. Let&#8217;s just seal the deal on whether this is quackery or not.  Here&#8217;s Pollack again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Informal discussion of the evidence for the role of water in health appears in an interview with Dr. Mercola. And, a recent lecture dealing with EZ water and health is found here. And, a grant proposal  submitted earlier to the NIH contains a more formal discussion of the evidence.</p>
<p>We are actively seeking funding to carry out a comprehensive study on the role of water in health. The public seems hungry for this kind of information. With our background in water chemistry and biology, we feel we&#8217;re well equipped to carry out those studies.</p>
<p>Who knows? EZ water may become the next wonder drug.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s Dr Ling&#8217;s legacy. He has provided a pseudoscientific rationale that quacks and con artists like Joe Mercola can use to sell water as a &#8220;wonder drug&#8221;. This is precisely what Ling wanted, that people would pick up on his notions and spread them far and wide.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m afraid of, that his crackpot ideas will be passed along to future generations &#8212; and as long as there are frauds trying to make a buck off science denial and bad science, it will happen.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, and don&#8217;t listen to people who try to sell you magic water. I know this kind of thing can be difficult &#8212; Ling was a smart guy, and he was pretty good at bamboozling a few people with elaborately technical biology talk. Let me tell you that all the stuff I said here was basic, well-established cell biology and biochemistry, work that has been acknowledged by some of the most prestigious scientific awards and which is pretty much standard fare in all the textbooks.</p>
<p>So do the like and subscribe thing if you want to encourage me to do more exposes of quacks and frauds. Or don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll probably continue to do it anyway.</p>

<p class="lead">Here&#8217;s a story that had me hopelessly confused: according to this one woman in the UK, she was denied essential surgery because the hospital wanted to pander to the transeses. It sounded unlikely to me, but hey, I don&#8217;t trust hospital administrators myself. Here, though, is an <a href="https://miniver.blogspot.com/2022/10/princess-grace-hospital-scandal-bs.html">article that explains it all</a>, using the woman&#8217;s own words.</p>
<p>It turns out she made a whole bunch of unreasonable demands, triggered by seeing someone she thought was a trans woman looking at her. So she insisted that no men be allowed anywhere near her, that she get a private room that allowed no men to enter, and that she <q>would not agree to use pronouns or otherwise engage with such manifestations of gender ideology</q>. She also accused men in general of having mobile phones that they use to look at sick, perverted pornography. The hospital told her that they could not meet her demands and told her to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all there at the link, but be warned: the complaining woman is a retired solicitor, and her complaints are lengthy and outrageous.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">There was a big <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/minnesota-gubernatorial-candidates-face-off-232713721.html">debate between the candidates for governor of Minnesota</a> last night. Did I watch it? No, I&#8217;ve already made up my mind that Jensen is an evil poop-flinging ape with regressive views on just about everything. I also knew what was coming after the debate: Jensen is throwing Twitter hysterics and is sounding rather desperate. He did say one thing I appreciate, though.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tim Walz is weak on the southern border, has emboldened the fentanyl crisis, and did NOTHING about the feeding our future fraud. He broke the LAW.</p>
<p>&mdash; Scott Jensen (@drscottjensen) <a href="https://twitter.com/drscottjensen/status/1582525882551631872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Minnesota&#8217;s southern border is with Iowa, and I think building a wall might be a very good idea. Perhaps an eastern wall as well, to defend against Wisconsinites. And then maybe a western wall to protect us from Dakotans.</p>
<p>But wait! I just remembered that winter is coming. Maybe Minnesota can instead be like a scrotum in the cold, and just contract and pull up into Canada. Cheaper all around. Never mind, I&#8217;ll cast my vote for Walz again.</p>
<p>By the way, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-health-travel-education-70d77fb2757d0b6fbc2012bf2c534a34">Feeding Our Future scandal</a> has nothing to do with Walz or the Minnesota state government at all. Some grifters set up shop here, taking advantage of a federal program to provide food for families during the pandemic, sending in false invoices and getting reimbursed to the tune of $250 million. Minnesota investigators turned them over to the FBI, so blaming on Walz is just flailing.</p>
<p>There were two things Jensen isn&#8217;t talking about, though. One is his abortion policy: he wants to ban it altogether, but knows that won&#8217;t fly in this state, so he&#8217;s evasive about it now.</p>
<p>The other is that he&#8217;s an election-denier, one of a number of people running for office in this state, including these rascals:</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/deniers.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/deniers-500x565.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="565" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68263" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/deniers-500x565.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/deniers-133x150.jpg 133w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/deniers-266x300.jpg 266w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/deniers.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Fischbach is my representative, and she&#8217;s probably going to coast to re-election because this region is largely populated with red-hatted gomers. None of those people should be elected to anything, though. That&#8217;s my great fear about the November election, that a swarm of anti-democratic Trumpkins get into office and begin playing games with election laws and triggering unwarranted doubts about every election, but especially ones where Democrats got elected. </p>
<p>It has the potential to be a colossal shit-show, thanks to those kinds of people who should be in jail rather than running for office. But, you know, we have to compete with the UK for the most spectacular political collapse ever, and we&#8217;ve got a shot at it.</p>

Symptoms of this &ldquo;melancholy delirium&rdquo; might include fever, disturbed sleep, palpitations, loss of appetite and anxiety. The Germans had a word for it: <em>heimweh</em> or &ldquo;home-woe&rdquo;. But Hofer coined a new medical term from the Greek <em>nostos</em>, meaning a homecoming, and <em>algos</em>, denoting pain. He called it nostalgia: an unassuageable grief for a lost homeland.</p> <p class="p4">The meaning of nostalgia may have changed, but two original and remarkable new books explore how Hofer&rsquo;s insight might resonate today in an age of mass migration and resurgent nationalism. Both dig deep into difficult questions around identity and belonging.</p> <p class="p4"><em>Exiles: Three Island Journeys</em> by William Atkins takes as its starting point the lives of three late 19th-century political exiles, each a figure of resistance and change. The French CommunardLouise Michel was transported to the Pacific island of New Caledonia. Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, a Zulu king, was exiled by the British to St Helena in the South Atlantic. And the Jewish Ukrainian revolutionary Lev Shternberg was sent to Sakhalin Island, off the coast of Siberia, by Tsarist Russia.</p> <p class="p4">Atkins&rsquo; primary interest is in how his subjects adapted to these ruptures in their lives. &ldquo;The thought of the distance kills us,&rdquo; one of Michel&rsquo;s fellow Communard exiles said. In later life, Shternberg taught ethnography in St Petersburg. His students described him as a man &ldquo;charred by some internal burning&rdquo;. Another exiled Communard &ldquo;died of grief at receiving no news from home&rdquo;. To be so unmoored was a kind of death-in-life.</p> <p class="p4">But you couldn&rsquo;t go back, even when you did, in fact, go back. For Dinuzulu, who adopted European clothing and manners during his eight years on St Helena, this was literally true. The defeated kingdom he left behind was broken up by the British, and he returned no longer a king, but as the governor of what was essentially a vassal territory, fractured by conflict and imperial taxation. And yet the land and its people were the source of his identity: &ldquo;the closer to his land he was allowed to be, the more powerful he grew,&rdquo; Atkins writes.</p> <p class="p4">Atkins visited the places he writes about. He searches for the traces his subjects left on the spaces they inhabited. But he is also exploring other kinds of exile and fracture, in particular the legacies of empire on these island prisons: the traumas that exiles and subject peoples might share. The indigenous Kanak of New Caledonia are still struggling today to free their country from French dominion. Atkins&rsquo; arrival coincides with a fractious independence vote, which the Kanak lost. He quotes the Kanak <br />independence campaigner Jean-Marie Tjibaou: &ldquo;The hardest thing is to stay alive and feel like a stranger in your own land.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p6">Imperial Europe transported immense numbers to its penal colonies. The British empire dispatched some 376,000, Tsarist Russia nearly two million. <em>Exiles</em>, then, is an intimate account of an epic phenomenon. Amaryllis Gacioppo&rsquo;s concern in <em>Motherlands: In Search of Our Inherited Cities </em>is more directly personal. Her starting point is the legacy of four generations of matrilineal migration within her family &ndash; in the 1920s from Turin to Benghazi, then part of Italian colonial Libya; from Benghazi to Palermo by way of Rome in the 1940s; from Palermo to the Sydney suburbs two decades later; and, for Gacioppo herself, a recent move from Australia, her place of birth, to Italy, a country that has both always and never been home to her.</p> <p class="p4">As Gacioppo traces these stories of displacement from city to city she explores wider ideas about dislocation and belonging. She recreates daily familial journeys and routines, trying to &ldquo;trigger a kind of temporal magic . . . [accessing] powers of memory or meaning or association&rdquo;. She is particularly interested in photographs and maps. A map of Allied bomb damage to Rome pales before the reality of a satellite photograph; but in colonial Benghazi it is the great-grandparents&rsquo; photos that seem unreal.</p> <p class="p4">Turin, Nietzsche said, is &ldquo;the first place where I am possible&rdquo;. If the goal of all migration is to find such a place, what of countries that make migrant lives impossible? In Rome, Gacioppo meets a woman campaigning for the rights of 1.5 million young Italians without citizenship, many of whom arrived in their infancy. They call themselves &ldquo;ghosts by law&rdquo;, denied a connection to their homeland&rsquo;s past, along with the certainty of a settled future.</p> <p class="p4">Gacioppo writes eloquently about the alienating dislocation of the <em>unheimlich</em> (literally, the unhomely) &ndash; what she calls &ldquo;a dispersal of the self, a confused state of inner unmooring&rdquo;. At the other end of the extreme, she visits the former SS headquarters in Rome, now a museum. In the cells, scratched into the walls, are the messages of the soon-to-be-tortured, soon-to-be-dead. &ldquo;Love Italy&rdquo;, one reads. &ldquo;Those who die for the homeland live for eternity&rdquo;, reads another. What is this idea of home, of place, that <br />belonging to it is more powerful than death?</p> <p class="p4">Mobility &ndash; migration, exile, colonisation &ndash; has always been part of the human condition. And the most meaningful kinds of belonging have nothing to do with borders or governments. &ldquo;[A] relationship to the land as a basis of cultural identity is one that echoes the beliefs and religions of native peoples all over the world,&rdquo; Gacioppo writes. But roots can also regrow. When Louise Michel returned to France from exile, she smuggled five cats out with her. They were, she said, &ldquo;something alive left from home&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p4">Both of these complex, thoughtful and deeply moving books also look towards the larger idea that, as Gacioppo writes, &ldquo;With each step forward into the future, something is lost, and this loss, the void created by it, travels with us. It is there to remind us that there is no such thing as returning.&rdquo; That is, the griefs of time, of separation, of mortality are another exile from which there is no return. If a true homecoming is impossible and this greater kind of exile haunts us all, who amongst us remains unbroken?</p> <p class="p4"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Pastafarians gather for a &ldquo;stand-in&rdquo; in Turin, 2015" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2EX5WMW.jpg" height="1000" alt="Pastafarians gather for a &ldquo;stand-in&rdquo; in Turin in 2015" width="1500" /></p> <p class="p1">One day in 2016, Derk Venema, a Dutch academic specialising in legal philosophy, was browsing the internet for examples of &ldquo;philosophically interesting questions about religious freedom&rdquo; to show his students. He came across the perfect case: a &ldquo;Pastafarian&rdquo;, or self-designated member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), was challenging the authorities for rejecting his driving licence photograph, in which he wore a colander on his head.</p> <p class="p3">Venema took a few students to watch the case before the local Chamber of Commerce. &ldquo;It was one of the most hilarious things I have ever witnessed,&rdquo; he says. Math&eacute; Coolen, the applicant, &ldquo;played his role excellently. Even the Commissioner was having a tough time not laughing.&rdquo; But when he spoke to Coolen afterwards, Venema realised that he was &ldquo;also very serious about the underlying questions, the questions about when and how administrative bodies get to decide what is a religion and what is not, and who gets to enjoy religious privileges and who doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">One of the students who accompanied Venema on his trip was Mienke de Wilde. She was so impressed by the case that she decided to become a Pastafarian herself. The next time she applied for a driving licence, she submitted a photo of herself wearing a colander. Her application was rejected. She appealed, claiming that Pastafarianism was a religion and her right to manifest it was protected under the European Convention on Human Rights. Venema took on her case and Coolen&rsquo;s; ultimately, it was de Wilde&rsquo;s alone that went all the way to the Dutch Administrative Court and then the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The court handed down judgment on 9 November last year. But before examining their conclusions, it is worth taking a step back to the origins of this strange &ldquo;religion&rdquo;.</p> <h2 class="p4">The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</h2> <p class="p5">In 2005, the Kansas School Board was considering whether to teach the theory of intelligent design alongside evolution. Bobby Henderson, a physics graduate from Oregon, wrote a now famous letter in which he claimed to believe that a &ldquo;Flying Spaghetti Monster&rdquo; created the world, and demanded that his theory be given equal time with the other two. He also claimed that &ldquo;global warming . . . and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Henderson had written the letter as satire. In doing so, however, he unexpectedly generated a meme. The internet was in its early days of cavalier freedom. Facebook had been founded the previous year and Twitter would be the next; chain emails were still a thing. At the same time, &ldquo;New Atheism&rdquo; was on the rise. Sam Harris had published <em>The End of Faith</em> in 2004, and contributions by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and Christopher Hitchens would soon follow. (Dennett later featured in the FSM documentary <em>I, Pastafari.</em>) It was fashionable among the godless youth to put &ldquo;Jedi&rdquo; as their religion on the UK census; 176,632 people did so in 2011. Parody was the flavour of the day. Pastafarianism went viral, and publishers rushed to sign Henderson up for a book contract.</p> <p class="p3">The result was <em>The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</em>, published by Villard less than six months before Dawkins&rsquo; <em>The God Delusion</em>. The<em> Gospel</em> according to Henderson is a picaresque series of pseudo-scientific rants, accompanied by diagrams and mock-formal logic, on topics from &ldquo;the need for alternative theories&rdquo; to &ldquo;a history of heretics&rdquo;. It is clearly designed to parody the attempts of evangelical Christians to co-opt science into supporting their literalist interpretation of the Bible.</p> <p class="p3">As a work of literature or philosophy, the <em>Gospel</em> has its limitations. In the words of Kathleen McEvoy, an Australian judge: &ldquo;At best the texts present ordinary moral admonitions and mundane articulations of principles of conduct present in the texts of most other established religions.&rdquo; Henderson himself, drawing a comparison with traditional scriptures, wrote that &ldquo;this book will stand up to any of the others &ndash; at least in terms of strict plausibility if not literary finesse and retributive beheadings and disembowelments.&rdquo; The book reportedly sold over 100,000 copies.</p> <p class="p3">Meanwhile, the memes of Pastafarianism have multiplied. A crucial moment in the Church&rsquo;s history came in 2011 in Austria, when Niko Alm was permitted to wear a colander in his driving licence photo &ndash; although only after a visit from a public health officer to check that he was sane. The police, who issued the licence, stated that &ldquo;the photo was not approved on religious grounds. The only criterion for photos in driving licence applications is that the whole face must be visible.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">This deftly sidestepped the underlying issue &ndash; but Alm&rsquo;s success led to a string of similar attempts around the world, including de Wilde&rsquo;s. Different authorities have responded in their own ways. In some places, often the more religious ones, the colander has been permitted, from the Czech Republic to Utah; in Poland, the Church of the FSM has been allowed to register as an official religion. In Belgium and Ireland, the colander has not made it through. In England in 2015, the DVLA rejected a colander photo by Ian Harris, described by the <em>Mail Online </em>as &ldquo;an eccentric man&rdquo;, because headgear was only &ldquo;permissible on religious or medical grounds&rdquo;. In Adelaide, Australia, Guy Albon had his guns confiscated after he submitted a colander photo for his licence, out of fears for his &ldquo;mental competency&rdquo;. More seriously, the Pastafarian Mikhail Iosilevich was issued his licence in Russia &ndash; but was later arrested on the political charge of &ldquo;cooperating with an undesirable organisation&rdquo;. In May, he was sentenced to 20 months in prison and ordered to pay civil damages roughly equivalent to &pound;1500.</p> <h2 class="p4">Is Pastafarianism a religion?</h2> <p class="p5">Wearing the colander can be interpreted as a protest against the legal exemptions and privileges readily granted to adherents of all the major world religions. The Dutch authorities, like the DVLA, would have permitted a turban, skull cap or nun&rsquo;s veil in ID photos as long as the face remained clear. De Wilde&rsquo;s case is the first and, so far, the only time that the European Court has considered whether Pastafarianism is a &ldquo;religion or belief&rdquo; worthy of protection in human rights law.</p> <p class="p3">The result of de Wilde&rsquo;s challenge, however, was the same in both Holland and Strasbourg: rejection. On the evidence, the Dutch courts found, and the European judges accepted, that she genuinely did wear a colander at all times when outside. (A black plastic colander which she likens to a &ldquo;bowler hat&rdquo; and wears at a rakish angle; she has a different one for cooking pasta.) But they could not accept that her beliefs constituted a &ldquo;religion&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">De Wilde argued that her beliefs were protected under Article 9 of the Convention on Human Rights, which states that, subject to various limitations:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p6">&ldquo;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">A regional court refused de Wilde&rsquo;s appeal on the grounds that wearing the colander was not mandatory in Pastafarianism. This argument was rejected on further appeal by the Administrative Jurisdiction of the Council of State, Holland&rsquo;s highest appeal court, because the case law of the ECtHR had previously held that the manifestation of a religion does not have to be mandatory to be protected.</p> <p class="p3">Instead, both the Administrative Court and the ECtHR rejected the claim that Pastafarianism could amount to a religion. Consequently, however much de Wilde wore her colander, it did not count as a religious act. The thorny path by which they reached this conclusion reveals the difficulties that arise when courts of law are asked to decide metaphysical questions.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;If you read an anthology on the concept of religion, you get hundreds of different definitions,&rdquo; says Paul Cliteur, Emeritus Professor of Jurisprudence at Leiden University. These go back to Cicero in the first century BC, who defined religion as &ldquo;reverence for the gods&rdquo;. It is unsurprising, Cliteur argues, that &ldquo;a bunch of judges assembled in the European Court&rdquo; should find it a tough nut to crack: &ldquo;they are not religious scholars, they are not philosophers, they are not involved.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p5">Through its case law, the ECtHR has developed a test for &ldquo;religion or belief&rdquo; under Article 9: to qualify, the relevant belief must have obtained &ldquo;a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance&rdquo;. In de Wilde&rsquo;s case, the judges quoted the reasoning of the Dutch Administrative Court, and then briefly reiterated it, to conclude that Pastafarianism failed to meet the requisite standards of &ldquo;seriousness and cohesion&rdquo;. The movement was designed to &ldquo;parody&rdquo; established religions in order to criticise the &ldquo;influence and privileged position afforded to [them] . . . in some contemporary societies&rdquo;; as such, it could not be a religion itself. Or, as the Dutch court put it, the &ldquo;satirical element&rdquo; was &ldquo;so dominant&rdquo; that the European Court&rsquo;s test could not be met.</p> <p class="p3">In the court&rsquo;s view, Pastafarianism was not serious; examples were drawn from Henderson&rsquo;s <em>Gospel</em>, including his &ldquo;Eight I&rsquo;d Really Rather You Didn&rsquo;ts&rdquo;, which parodied the Ten Commandments. Nor was it sufficiently cohesive; the court took as its example the pirates-and-global-warming theory. The court was equally dismissive of de Wilde&rsquo;s argument that her own &ldquo;individual version&rdquo; of Pastafarianism could be serious and cohesive, even if the movement as a whole was not; her explanations, it held, were too &ldquo;general and abstract&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">There is clearly force in the view that a humorous parody of something cannot itself be that thing. If the law is required to define concepts like &ldquo;religion or belief&rdquo;, then there must be limiting cases. Henderson&rsquo;s monster started as a sarcastic attack on the teaching of creationism. Its claims are outrageous and entirely unbelievable: that is the point. Wearing a colander or a pirate hat for an ID photo is ridiculous. The purpose of doing so is to question the idea that some forms of headgear are allowed, but not others, on the basis of unprovable dogma.</p> <h2 class="p4">Freedom of religion, or freedom of thought?</h2> <p class="p5">Yet there are difficulties with the courts&rsquo; reasoning if Pastafarianism is compared with other belief systems &ndash; and, like all parody, it is designed to be compared. Seriousness, for one, is not as straightforward a criterion as it appears. Take Mormonism, says Venema: it&rsquo;s &ldquo;hilarious&rdquo;. Indeed, to non-believers, the Book of Mormon reads like a parody of the Bible. If Pastafarianism is zany, it reflects the zaniness of established religions. As Henderson writes, &ldquo;every time an &lsquo;official&rsquo; ruling is made against our Church it illustrates how absurd the whole idea is of the state defining what is a legitimate religious organisation.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">The European Court&rsquo;s reasoning also betrays the extent to which, in judicial considerations of Article 9, the paradigm case is religion, and other beliefs are only extensions of that. The court concluded that Pastafarianism &ldquo;seeks the same privileges for itself [as for established religions] with a view to propagating its message.&rdquo; That is what it would do if it were a &ldquo;real&rdquo; religion, or a sham religion trying to gain money from its supporters. Yet De Wilde told me that she would be happy to remove the colander for her ID photo, as long as others did. &ldquo;We just want to be treated equally.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">There are many undercurrents in the Dutch courts&rsquo; resistance to Pastafarianism. One, argues Venema, is the civil servant&rsquo;s instinctive fear of mockery. &ldquo;We even discovered that there was a lot of communication by city administrations with the Ministry for the Interior. They were advised to deny all these applications by people who wore spaghetti strainers on their heads.&rdquo; As a result of this and the Dutch judgments, says de Wilde, the authorities have effectively discouraged any more Pastafarians from applying.</p> <p class="p3">A similar attitude was evinced by a Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois judge in another Pastafarian case in 2015. In the judge&rsquo;s view, the applicant, Isabelle Narayana, who wanted to wear a pirate hat in her ID photo, was treating &ldquo;in a banal manner the fundamental rights and liberties protected by the [Canadian human rights] charters, to the point of rendering them insignificant.&rdquo; He said her claim was &ldquo;an immense farce that aims to mock religions&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">Tanya Watkins, self-appointed Captain of the Church of the FSM in Australia, met with similar treatment when she applied to register it as a religious organisation. The judge, Kathleen McEvoy, considered that the scriptures of Pastafarianism were &ldquo;parodic texts, developed and expressed for the purpose of mocking and satirising established religions, holding them up to ridicule and suggesting they are worthless and meaningless&rdquo;. She even lambasted them for being &ldquo;racist&rdquo;, &ldquo;sexist&rdquo; and likely to be &ldquo;offensive or insulting&rdquo; to (real) religions.</p> <p class="p3">The implication of such judgments is that there is something nefarious about mocking religions in this way &ndash; perhaps due to a sense, in secular countries like Australia, the Netherlands and the UK, that protecting religious exceptionalism is a way of protecting minorities. Yet it is a sad state of affairs when the courts shrink from engaging with the question at the heart of the matter: whether the starting point in human rights law should be religion &ndash; cogent, serious and important &ndash; or whether it should be the freedom to think, believe or withhold belief, and act. If the latter (the secular starting-point), then there would be no need for courts to build a hierarchy of beliefs, or to stop Pastafarians from wearing colanders because they were not serious enough.</p> <p class="p5">For de Wilde, the point of fighting her case, and being deprived of a driving licence for five years in the process, is to achieve &ldquo;equality&rdquo;. In her view, Pastafarianism is &ldquo;not less real than other religions&rdquo;. Watkins agrees: &ldquo;it has all of the same elements any other religion has,&rdquo; and the same inconsistency in its followers&rsquo; interpretations.</p> <p class="p3">Depending on your perspective, Pastafarians are either the most undogmatic believers in history, or unbelievers who will go to extreme lengths to protest against religious exceptionalism. &ldquo;In a certain sense,&rdquo; says Cliteur, &ldquo;and I speak as an atheist, Pastafarianism is the ideal religion. If all humanity were Pastafarians &ndash; people with a sense of humour and a relaxed attitude towards their religious convictions &ndash; that would be a tremendous improvement.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Venema, despite his devotion to the Pastafarian cause, has not become an adherent. &ldquo;I have never considered joining any groups or organisations that are founded on a specific idea,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;As a philosopher, I want to be free to think and express anything I want . . . Which I could still do as a Pastafarian, of course.&rdquo; There you have it: a religion with no requirements, which is still too restrictive for a freethinking philosopher.</p> <p class="p3">Perhaps it is also a question of taste, and of the symbols people use to express themselves; colanders and cutlasses are not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. Not that Pastafarians are required to wear them.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. </em><em><a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p class="lead">Steve Sviggum wrote a real purty apology, seemed sincere and contrite. He really did.</p>
<p>Then he got an interview with a sympathetic reporter and said <a href="https://alphanews.org/university-of-minnesota-regent-resists-calls-to-resign/">what he honestly thinks</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sviggum, who served in the Minnesota Legislature for 30 years, said he has dedicated his life to public service and will not be pressured to resign. He said he’s concerned identity politics is ruining the country.</p>
<p><q>If the far left doesn’t ruin it, identity politics will. The woke community, the liberal community, if I may be so bold as to say, has taken [my question] and jumped on it. They say it’s racist and sexist. That’s the community that says, ‘If you don’t think like me and you’re not part of the group, you don’t belong. You’re a bad guy, and we will destroy you,&#8217;</q> he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, his apology was a pretense.</p>

<p class="lead">Last spring, Randy Kaufman, Republican running for the governing board of the Maricopa County Community College District, was deeply concerned about those leftist perverts and just wanted to protect the children. The children! Think of the children!</p>
<blockquote><p>In a Facebook post from May, Kaufman said he wanted “our children protected [from] the progressive left.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, in October, a policeman noticed him parked near a pre-school, and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arizona-gop-candidate-arrested-allegedly-masturbating-truck_n_635007e2e4b03e8038da457f">approached him to see what was going on</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Kaufman] appeared to be looking at a cell phone in one hand,” the police report said. “I immediately became alarmed as I saw [Kaufman] had his pants down mid-thigh and was exposed showing his fully erect nude penis. [Kaufman] was manipulating his genitals in a masturbatory manner.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He now faces a felony charge and has suspended his political campaign.</p>
<p>I guess he was thinking really hard about the children.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="The Nine Ladies stone circle, Stanton Moor " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Nine_Ladies_stone_circle,_Stanton_Moor_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2360408.jpg" height="631" alt="The Nine Ladies of Stanton Moor" width="946" /></p> <p class="p1">Stanton Moor is situated in Derbyshire&rsquo;s beautiful Peak District National Park, in the heart of England. At first glance up here, it&rsquo;s all foxgloves, purple heather and wildflowers. But if you have an archaeologist&rsquo;s eye, like my friend Ian Jackson, you can detect something more deliberately patterned in the rocky formations that stretch out to the horizon in every direction: the outline of a Bronze Age roundhouse, sunken into the rock-strewn moor. The walls are long fallen and weathered away. Ian pointed out the narrow path that leads downwards and suddenly I saw it too. I stepped into the entrance and back through time. I was in someone&rsquo;s home.</p> <p class="p2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re closer to the Bronze Age people than they were to those who built Stonehenge,&rdquo; Ian observed. For a moment I was struck silent with the majesty of that timescale.</p> <p class="p2">I had come Bronze Age hunting because, like many people it seems, I have recently become fascinated with the pre-Roman peoples of the British Isle. My walk was partly prompted by the British Museum&rsquo;s blockbuster early summer exhibition on Stonehenge, the Neolithic stone circle in Wiltshire. Such stone circles pepper the length and breadth of this island nation. Not far from Stanton Moor is Arbor Low, another Neolithic stone circle at which the stones are now flat on the ground. Historians believe they were deliberately knocked down by medieval people, fuelled by their own superstitions.</p> <p class="p2">Stonehenge is a monument that Brits tend to think of as archetypically British. But the exhibition confounded all expectations. A wall mounted with dozens of beautiful stone axe heads from all over Europe revealed, post-Brexit, an almost provocatively counterintuitive picture; Britain connected by a large land bridge to northern Europe, with Stonehenge as the trading and pilgrimage heart of a borderless world. Recent excavations have provided plentiful evidence of trade from further afield &ndash; pottery, jewellery and weapons from the Middle East, North Africa and Asia Minor. More intriguing still were the mysterious carvings of flowing spirals and cups and rings, on giant rocks and boulders found across Europe, from Germany to Scotland.</p> <p class="p2">The British Museum show was fascinating &ndash; but there were some troubling aspects too. The exhibition included skeletons that had been unearthed in graves. One was the skeleton of a woman who was still clutching the outline of her dead baby, a bag of more than a hundred animal teeth buried with them as a spiritual offering. After more than a century of challenge, museums would not, I think, dare to display the human remains of ancient First Nation peoples this way. On the one hand, modern Europeans claim a kinship with these ancient brothers and sisters, and yet we tolerate what could be seen as the desecration of their graves. With their belief systems long lost, they have no one to advocate for them.</p> <p class="p2">And yet there is an honest spiritual craving in our modern behaviour around ancient monuments. Stonehenge is now understood to have been built in line with the natural cycle of the Earth&rsquo;s rotation around the Sun, aligning with sunrise during the solstices. Humanists surely recognise the pull of acknowledging our place in the beautiful but indifferent Solar System.</p> <p class="p4">Iwitnessed this pull in action on that day before the summer solstice when Ian and I walked on Stanton Moor. Not far from where Ian pointed out the outline of ancient homes is a Bronze Age stone circle known as the Nine Ladies. Around it, a tent city had grown up, of young families as much as old hippies, wanting to be part of something bigger than themselves. Such gatherings have been happening all over the country at stone circles.</p> <p class="p2">Part of it, I&rsquo;m sure, is that after all the Covid lockdowns, we are still cherishing our right to roam freely and be with others. But there seems to be something else we are craving. It may seem that we know very little about our ancient ancestors. We don&rsquo;t have a good idea of how they looked, and even their bones have mostly vanished. But they have left the most tantalising glimpses: jewellery made of black obsidian; gold torques of such weight and braided beauty it&rsquo;s dazzling to imagine them worn in ritual acts. It&rsquo;s also pleasing to discover that some of the finds in the Stonehenge exhibition suggest women may well have held positions of power in these societies, as shamans.</p> <p class="p2">These were humans living on a minute timescale compared to the weathered rocks of their monuments. Yet their mystery binds them to us. We are drawn to the idea of their transience &ndash; for what did the pandemic do more to reveal than the fragility of our own lives?</p> <p class="p2"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. </em><em><a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><img title="Buddhist monks at Facebook&rsquo;s headquarters" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/buddhafacebook.jpeg" height="1010" alt="Buddhist monks at Facebook" width="1596" /></strong></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Work Pray Code (Princeton University Press) </strong></span><span class="s1">by Carolyn Chen </span></p> <p class="p1">&ldquo;What happens to us, and what happens to religion, when people worship work?&rdquo; This is the question that occupies sociologist Carolyn Chen in <em>Work Pray Code</em>, her new book based on in-depth research on Silicon Valley&rsquo;s tech industry. Her answer reveals the book&rsquo;s title (with its suggestion of bounded activities) to be a slight misnomer. For, as Chen discovers, work is not only &ldquo;replacing religion&rdquo; (increasingly omnipresent in employees&rsquo; lives, and the object of faith and devotion); it is infused with spiritual and religious practices geared, ultimately, towards maximum productivity. This is a world where work is not so much distinct from prayer as blurred with it.</p> <p class="p2">Chen suggests that Silicon Valley &ndash; ostensibly one of America&rsquo;s &ldquo;least religious&rdquo; places &ndash; is not so &ldquo;godless&rdquo; after all. The tech workplace is &ldquo;conscripting&rdquo; religion; borrowing (typically, but not exclusively) from Asian spiritual and religious traditions, such as yoga and meditation, to help employees to become &ldquo;whole&rdquo; and connect to their &ldquo;authentic selves&rdquo;. But the nurturing care and cultivation of employees&rsquo; spiritual lives are not altruistic. Rather, they rest upon the logic that the &ldquo;self-alienated&rdquo; worker operates at sub-optimal capacity. They are also vulnerable to burnout, which is blamed not on overwork, but &ldquo;insufficient self-care&rdquo;. No wonder, then, that employees might seek &ldquo;optimisation&rdquo; through practices including meditation, journaling and even fasting. Chen quotes one CEO who asks his staff to anonymously rate, weekly, aspects of their lives including spirituality. &ldquo;Everyone knows&rdquo;, he explains, &ldquo;that if you&rsquo;re not taking care of yourself, you&rsquo;re not playing for the team.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p2">Chen describes the &ldquo;meditation entrepreneurs&rdquo; &ndash; including mindfulness teachers, HR executives and the coaches allocated to high-potential staff &ndash; who share the challenge of selling &ldquo;a religious product in a professedly secular workplace&rdquo;. In doing so, they renounce a &ldquo;sacred, separate, Asian, otherworldly, and ethical religious Buddhism&rdquo;, and replace it with one that is &ldquo;universalised, Whitened, scientised, profitable, and efficient&rdquo;. Meditation thus becomes a snackable &ldquo;skill&rdquo; used to aid creativity, flow and focus (alongside empathy, with a view to enabling more &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; design). Indeed, the practices Chen describes seem so far from actual Buddhism that one wonders whether they can be analysed in terms of &ldquo;religion&rdquo; at all. Chen explains: &ldquo;tech meditators&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;religious&rdquo;, but use &ldquo;religious traditions &ndash; their practices, rituals, and teachings &ndash; as tools or technologies to optimise their work performance&rdquo;, directed towards the &ldquo;religion of work&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p2">Though wonderfully rich in detail, <em>Work Pray Code</em> is frustrated by its failure to provide, early on, a firm working definition of &ldquo;religion&rdquo;. This is clarified in an appendix, where Chen suggests that religion &ldquo;in a secular age&rdquo; can be studied not only through &ldquo;religious things&rdquo;, but those things that are also &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; to us and command worship (e.g. work, worshipped through yoga). Still, it leads one to wonder where &ldquo;spirituality&rdquo; ends and &ldquo;religion&rdquo; &ndash; and, indeed, cultishness &ndash; begins. Some readers may find Chen&rsquo;s conclusion conservative: though critical of the extent to which work is worshipped, Chen does not challenge work itself; likewise, she criticises &ldquo;religions&rdquo; for not confronting work worship, but leaves religion per se untouched. She suggests, &ldquo;Religious traditions can offer a powerful and distinct set of ethics, communities, and rituals to counter the morally bereft religion of work.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p2">Still, Chen&rsquo;s critique of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Techtopia&rdquo; and its impact on the wider social fabric is powerful. She describes how participatory democracy &ndash; indeed, the common good &ndash; suffers when we worship work and disengage from civic life; how public goods become private &ldquo;perks&rdquo; when the tech industry dominates; how so-called &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; and &ldquo;the basic stuff of a good life&rdquo; has become the &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; of the highly skilled, while others lack even basic security. Silicon Valley is, she suggests, a bellwether. One need not agree with Chen&rsquo;s framework of &ldquo;religion&rdquo; to see that we must pay attention.</p> <p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></span></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

You pass the window of a book store, or switch on a political talk show, and are overwhelmed by an irritating sensation of deja vu. Haven&rsquo;t you heard these ideas before? Behind the shiny new designs, aren&rsquo;t these latest non-fiction hardbacks peddling the same basic theories, tweaked to entice a fresh audience? It can be difficult to gauge how our own personal frustration relates to the broader reality. On Sunday, HowTheLightGetsIn London confronted this perception head on. HTLGI is a festival dedicated to "big ideas", bringing together academics, scientists, creatives and "thought leaders" of all stripes. They have more than a vested interest, therefore, in answering the question. Is our intellectual climate in Britain stagnating? If so, how do we encourage new and original thinking?</p> <p class="p2">The event brought together speakers from the diverse fields of philosophy, theoretical physics and journalism to chew over the dilemma. While the term &ldquo;Renaissance Man&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t pass the lips of any of the speakers (although they might have updated it to &ldquo;Renaissance person&rdquo;), the figure of the free-thinking polymath was a definite spectre in the room. John Ellis, the renowned theoretical particle physicist, called for a more meaningful exchange of ideas and collaboration between disciplines. He pointed out that the experimental techniques he uses to test his ideas within the field of fundamental physics could fruitfully be applied to climate science. While it&rsquo;s possible, he said, to get small pots of money for this kind of work, securing funding for such projects in the longer term is disappointingly difficult.</p> <p class="p2">"Interdisciplinarity" is a term that is readily bandied about these days, but as the philosopher Sophie Scott-Brown remarked, we "need to pay more attention to what it actually means." She said this could be anything from bringing academics from different departments together to &ldquo;sit around the same table&rdquo; to &ldquo;melting down the barriers&rdquo; between disciplines. She is strongly in favour of the latter, envisioning a transformative shift towards a more creative, &ldquo;inquiry-led&rdquo; approach. Taking up John Ellis&rsquo; point, dynamic and complex problems like the climate crisis, or the future of global security, could be tackled with the inventiveness required through putting more emphasis on bringing people together on the basis of what knowledge and skills they might bring to the challenge, whatever their field.</p> <p class="p2">But this isn't only a question of transforming our approach to learning and research. The trend towards specialisation is tightly linked today with the pressure on universities to adopt business practices and become increasingly self-sufficient, in the light of severe government cuts. The incentive to meet targets, the pressure to secure funding, and the fierce competition for students all serve to create an environment in which, in Scott-Brown's words, ideas are pumped out as "products". Meanwhile, the kind of open-ended inquiry that so often produces new discoveries is hampered by the need to justify the research in advance. &ldquo;Most of my colleagues have to be 99 per cent sure about what they&rsquo;re writing before putting forward a funding application.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p2">It's interesting that the most concrete idea came from the non-academic on the panel. The journalist David Aaronovitch made an impassioned plea to &ldquo;abolish the A-level&rdquo;, arguing that this would change the culture of learning that runs from school into universities. He claimed that every single British government had done a report on the A-level and found it to be wanting, but that there was a stubborn belief that specialisation is what makes the English system exceptional. He advocated switching to the International Baccalaureate (IB). The United States has the largest number of IB programmes, in both private and state schools, and he suggested that we take some lessons from the American approach, where university degrees are also four years, instead of three, and place more emphasis on students studying a wider breadth of subjects.</p> <p class="p2">Aaronovitch disagreed that our society is suffering from a lack of new big ideas, however. Following the two "isms" of the 20th century (communism and fascism), we now have a distrust of them which is perfectly healthy, he argued. We can see this plainly from the much more recent example of Prime Minister Truss&rsquo; mini-budget, which is deeply &ldquo;ideological&rdquo; and has been a "failure". With big questions like how do we get to net zero, he said, "I'm happy to be more pragmatic."</p> <p class="p2">Whether in pursuit of bold new theories, or working on practical solutions, there is hope when it comes to bringing people together. John Ellis praised the inclusion of more women and people of colour in the research community, and the way in which technology was creating a more level playing field when it came to participating in scientific debate. &ldquo;And here I am,&rdquo; he joked, &ldquo;in a philosophy debate, while two other debates are going on about my own field of science.&rdquo; HowTheLightGetsIn is one of the spaces where philosophers and scientists in particular benefit from coming together. &ldquo;This is us forming the new society,&rdquo; Scott-Brown said.</p> <p class="p2">But the festival happens twice a year, a drop in the ocean. For the spirit of a New Renaissance to take hold, changes would be needed on many levels: cultural, political and economic. It's certain that we need creativity and invention in order to meet the confluence of crises facing Britain today. While our current Prime Minister may indeed have outlined a consistent ideological position, her ideas are explicitly rooted in Thatcherism. It seems likely that a failure to generate new big ideas appropriate to the particular challenges Britain faces today will only lead to a dangerous re-hashing of the old. We know that our intellectual climate is fed by many sources, but the health of the academy, along with our education system as a whole, is surely the bedrock of the edifice. Interdisciplinarity will be key to renewal, but any transformation will need to start by treating universities not as businesses within the higher education market, but as spaces of learning, sharing and discovery.</p> <p class="p2"><em>More details on HowTheLightGetsIn, the world's largest ideas and music festival, can be found <a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/london">here</a>. </em></p> <p class="p2"><em>For those of you who couldn't be with us in person, all the debates and talks from the festival will gradually be released online in the coming months on the Institute of Art and Ideas online platform, <a href="https://iai.tv/?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;utm_campaign=London2022&amp;utm_id=Partner">IAI.TV</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
