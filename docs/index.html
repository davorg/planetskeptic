<blockquote><p>The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol voted Monday to send to Justice Department prosecutors a recommendation that former president Donald Trump be charged with four crimes: inciting or assisting an insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to make a false statement. The move has no legal weight, but marks the first time Congress has made such a referral for a former president.</p></blockquote>
<p>Will the Justice Dept. do anything about it? Will Trump be allowed to continue to run for president? Will there be any consequences at all?</p>
<p>I have no confidence in justice in this country anymore.</p>

<p class="lead">This is Rob Finnerty, a newsreader for Newsmax. Nice hair, strong chin, looks like a real Chad.</p>
<p>Also, he&#8217;s real mad about something, like a real Chad. He&#8217;s mad about the availability of dolls, which is a little off-brand for a Chad…unless he can make it about black people.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My daughter is just a cute little 6-year-old white girl — we couldn’t find anybody that looked like my daughter,” Finnerty said in the video. “It was—the whole place, it was, like wokeified. How long has this been going on with American Girls? It was somewhat of a bizarre experience.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Wokeified&#8221;? This word is getting overused by the Right.</p>
<p>Also, he lied. Check out the <a href="https://www.americangirl.com/">American Girl store</a> online &#8212; there&#8217;s a wide range of skin tones available. A TikToker visited the same store shortly after his rant, and <a href="https://www.intheknow.com/post/news-anchor-lying-american-girl-doll/">found it well-stocked</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost immediately, Fidel noticed that the store was brimming with white dolls — not only on display but in boxes stacked high on shelves and in animated videos on the wall.</p>
<p>“The literal first doll that you see when you walk into the store,” Fidel says, zooming in on a smiling white doll with blond pigtails.</p>
<p>Fidel continues to walk around the store, recording the multitude of white dolls on shelves and in boxes. He remarks that, while the store has “thrown in some other races,” a “great portion” of the dolls on display are white.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theroot.com/newsmaxs-rob-finnerty-lied-like-a-dog-when-he-said-the-1849904850">The Root checked out the story as well</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Root’s office is located just a few steps from the American Girl store. Our writers and editors pass by it everyday and we can clearly say the store is mostly filled with white dolls.</p>
<p>“Did he stop to think that perhaps all of the white dolls were sold out at the store? Was going on the American Girl website not an option for him? Surely if he did, his panic would’ve subsided,” she wrote. “In the All Dolls section, you must scroll through almost 20 white dolls before you get to a doll of color.</p>
<p>“I also imagine he forgot about the decades that cute, little Black and brown girls could only choose from all-white doll shelves — none of which looked anything like them. Why? Because whiteness was the default.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You must forgive Chad…I mean, Rob. He&#8217;s not a journalist. He doesn&#8217;t actually investigate anything. He reads a teleprompter, and looks for things that will inflame his audience of old racists. He didn&#8217;t get the job because he&#8217;s perceptive, or intelligent, or well-educated, he&#8217;s there to <em>look</em> smart on TV. He is what he is, which is the very lowest rung on the information ladder. He&#8217;s also not a trustworthy rung, so ignore him.</p>

<p class="lead">I doubt it, and having been on this evolving beast we call &#8220;the internet&#8221; since the early 1990s, I can pretty convincingly assert that it has been a mixed bag from the very beginning. But I will also claim that it used to be <em>better</em>. I think this <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/06/03/the-internet-can-still-be-small-and-nice-but-its-on-all-of-us-to-make-that-work/">article hits the nail on the head</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wil Wheaton just published <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-internet-used-to-be-smaller-and-nicer-lets-get-it-back-11654261200?mod=rsswn">a great opinion piece</a> in the Wall Street Journal with the title “The Internet Used to be Smaller and Nicer. Let’s Get It Back.” I’ll get to the content of the article in moment, but first I want to discuss the choice of publication. By publishing in the WSJ, the piece is behind a paywall, though it does seem to randomly allow people to get in (often seems to work if you click through via Twitter). In some ways, the fact that Wil chose to publish in the WSJ is a microcosm of the issue that he’s discussing in the piece: you publish in the WSJ because it’s likely to attract a larger audience than publishing on your own site (and Wil does maintain and regularly publish his own independent blog which is full of great content).</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read Wheaton&#8217;s article, and it&#8217;s unlikely that I will. It&#8217;s behind a paywall, and do I look like the kind of guy who would subscribe to the WSJ? That&#8217;s the problem &#8212; that we constantly cede access to information to wealthy corporations. Elon Musk, with his arbitrary, capricious, small-minded limiting of the privilege of posting on Twitter is not a new phenomenon. That&#8217;s been a problem for the last decade, when Google killed the independent web.</p>
<blockquote><p>But, there are always tradeoffs. Relying on someone else’s platform is often just much easier. It doesn’t involve having to maintain your own site, and it’s also often where the audience is. The issue with blogs is that you had to attract — and then keep — an audience. Tools like RSS acted as a method for keeping people coming back, but… then Google became the de facto provider of RSS reading tools, and then killed it. To this day, that move is still considered one of <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/21/22586870/google-reader-ode-end-of-the-good-internet">the defining moments</a> in the shift from a more distributed, independent web to one that is controlled by a few large companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don&#8217;t remember the heyday of RSS, it was…different. You had to customize your access a little bit &#8212; when you stumbled across an interesting article, you&#8217;d click a button and tell your reader to check this site out in the future and let you know when something new appeared there. It wasn&#8217;t hard to do at all, but it did require that you personally flag sites of interest. Then, you&#8217;d have a page in your web browser that would automatically list all the recently updated sites.</p>
<p>You had to do your own curation, rather than the current situation, where Google and Facebook and Twitter do all the work and tell you what you want to read. You know all this algorithm nonsense? That&#8217;s all that it is, big companies thinking for you and telling you what you want to look at…and buy. And it all happened in 2013, when Google decided it wasn&#8217;t going to let you make your own decisions anymore.</p>
<p>We were all at fault, though. It&#8217;s so much easier to let capitalism control what you see. I&#8217;m guilty, too &#8212; there&#8217;s a list of blog links to the left on this page that are a vestige of when I tried to replace Google Reader&#8217;s functionality with my own list of cool things on the web. I haven&#8217;t updated it in years! It&#8217;s just there, mostly ignored, because it&#8217;s easier to be distracted by &#8220;trending&#8221; pages and the stuff that pours in as soon as I open Google.</p>
<p>I have a New Year&#8217;s resolution, for a change, and that is to clean that stuff up and make it more of a habit to use my RSS reader (it&#8217;s <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, by the way, easy to use and free, although I&#8217;m open to other recommendations). You should try it too &#8212; you&#8217;ll get a more varied diet of information and escape out from under the corporate thumb, a little bit.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="A Roman Feast, by Roberto Bompiani (1821-1908)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/saturnalia-_2_.jpg" height="1035" alt="A Roman Feast (Saturnalia), Second Half of the 19th cen.. Creator: Bompiani, Roberto (1821-1908)" width="1596"></p> <p>It&rsquo;s that time again, when everyone is spinning in the maelstrom of cheesy TV commercials, crackers, Secret Santas, festive jumpers, hangovers &ndash; and a slew of seasonal anxieties. Will the cards arrive on time? Will the promised turkey materialise? Will the new robot come with batteries? And what on earth can you get for that difficult sister-in-law?</p> <p>But where, as a self-respecting sceptic, do you draw the line? You won&rsquo;t, presumably, display models of the manger and the shepherds in your front garden, nor an advent calendar on the mantlepiece to build anticipation for the miracle birth. Perhaps you might be tempted to attend Midnight Mass, just for the spectacle, or to go carol-singing because it&rsquo;s for charity. But will you be having a Christmas tree? And if so, how are you planning to decorate it?</p> <p>During these recession-plunged times, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend anything at all on fripperies. Instead you could just tart up your existing baubles. The Guardian shows you how to make paper snowflakes, and how to marble your balls. The website <em>YourHomeStyle </em>recommends using chalk paint to spray over the ornaments, or over the tree for a frosty look. And if you really want to cut down, they suggest, you could always make your own chalk paint which, they guarantee, will ensure your tree will look like nobody else&rsquo;s. Not always in a good way.</p> <p>For a natural look you don&rsquo;t need to spend any money at all. Just gather a few twigs, pine cones and springs of holly and smugly parade your green values. As long as you buy locally you could actually be helping the planet as many UK growers will plant new ones for every one cut down &ndash; up to 10 each tree according to the Woodland Trust.</p> <p>And real ones are far better than fake. The Carbon Trust calculates that a two-metre artificial tree has a carbon footprint of around 40kg, more than ten times that of a real tree that&rsquo;s burned after Christmas. Most artificial trees are made in China, with the dual environmental impact of being made from plastic, PVC and metal, and then shipped overseas. And they&rsquo;re not recyclable, so when they&rsquo;re inevitably thrown away, they end up in landfill.</p> <p>But why have a tree at all? Maybe you&rsquo;re a bit chary about joining in the collective worship of the baby Jesus, alongside all the paraphernalia of nativities, carol services and church-going. But if you do crave a tree you don&rsquo;t need to worry that you&rsquo;re subscribing to the Christian myth. Evergreen trees have been a potent symbol in numerous cultures across the world long before the birth in the stable. Christianity simply co-opted existing rituals and made them its own.</p> <p class="MsoCommentText">It wasn&rsquo;t until after 300 BC that the emperor Constantine made Christianity a State 'religion'. Before then, the Roman's winter celebration of Saturnalia bore striking similarities to our Christmas traditions today. People lit candles, gave gifts and decorated trees in honour of Saturn, the god of sewing and seeds. Saturnalia was for some time celebrated around the winter solstice in late December, and some have argued that it is the forebear of our Christmas tradition today. Equally, it could just be that humans down the centuries have liked to feast, drink, make fire and contemplate the regenerative power of nature at the darkest and bleakest point of the year.</p> <p>In the Middle East many civilisations worshipped a version of the goddess Asherah, the &ldquo;Queen of Heaven&rdquo;. Her main symbol was a pole or a tree, which the ancient Canaanites viewed as a signifier of fertility. Druids are thought to have believed that the white berries of mistletoe represented the semen of the gods. Wreaths, in the pagan tradition, were made in a circle to stand for female fertility.</p> <p class="MsoCommentText">Some pagans regard the red berries of the holly as a symbol of menstrual blood while Wiccans use holly wood to make wands. Both holly and mistletoe were hung in doorways of temples and homes to invoke powers of fertility in those who stood beneath and kissed, causing the spirits of the god and goddess to enter them.</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">The association of the evergreen fir with carnality hasn&rsquo;t entirely disappeared. A few years ago outraged residents of a northern town in Russia reacted furiously to the appearance of a phallic-looking Christmas tree outside the local concert hall. Some demanded that authorities remove the bizarre-shaped tree, which they nicknamed the &ldquo;penis fir&rdquo; because of its extremely bulbous bottom and shaft-like top.</p> <p>No wonder they were upset. Once Christianity had taken over, with its obsessive obliteration of sex, no such base allusions were allowed, so the phallic symbols were replaced by Biblical ones.</p> <p>Red berries came to represent the blood of Christ, and the pointy leaves the crown of thorns placed upon his head as he was crucified. Wreaths, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to learn, are no longer wombs. Instead they are a sign of God&rsquo;s eternal love.</p> <p>If you&rsquo;re finding all of this stifling symbolism too much to take, you can always create your own atheist semiotic code instead. Let&rsquo;s start with the evergreen tree itself which in all cultures means immortality and the promise of rebirth. So it&rsquo;s just as meaningful for humanists, as a celebration of the cycle of life. You&rsquo;re definitely okay with tinsel, too. Simply redefine it as a manifestation of religious superstition: a shiny rope winding over the leaves of logic.</p> <p>But what will you put on the top? Presumably not an angel which, in Christian iconography, refers to the one who appeared high in the sky on the first Christmas, heralding the birth of Jesus. A star? Sorry &ndash; the star represents the Star of Bethlehem, which guided the Three Wise Men to the stable where Jesus was born.</p> <p>Instead of these you could select a favourite secular saint. How about a figure of Einstein, to demonstrate the value of science? Or Emmeline Pankhurst for feminism? One year I draped a &ldquo;Votes for Women&rdquo; sash round the tree, but the masculine holly snagged it to shreds. For a different version of tribal worship why not a likeness of England football manager Gareth Southgate? These are easily available and probably, these days, cut price. If you don&rsquo;t want to invest in a real statue, just cut out a picture and paste it on to card. I once did that with a portrait of the American actress, writer and singer Mae West, proclaiming, &ldquo;I&lsquo;m no Angel.&rdquo;</p> <p class="trt0xe">That was just one of her proud boasts during her seven-decade entertainment career. She was famous for her outspoken sexual appetite and bawdy one-liners. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m good I&rsquo;m very good,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but when I&rsquo;m bad I&rsquo;m better.&rdquo; And, she explained, &ldquo;I used to be Snow White, but I drifted.&rdquo;</p> <p>And now to the lights. Christmas trees used to be decorated with candles, symbolising Jesus as a divine light, and the star that led the three wise men. Today&rsquo;s tree lights can also be seen as the stars and planets in the firmament. But for pagans, the use of light around the winter solstice represented the promise of light in the darkest time of year. Which couldn&rsquo;t be more humanist.</p> <p>So let your Christmas tree celebrate that most sacred of secular movements: the Enlightenment. Rejoice in the sign of the rebirth of science, the glory of human endeavour, the triumph of reason over superstition, and a promise of better, more rational times to come.</p> <p>Provided you don&rsquo;t get the ones that flicker.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Schmidt </span></p> <p class="p5">Harvard, a place of tradition and legacy, does not take kindly to proposals for major organisational restructuring. Yet, in 1946, a group of scholars did just that when they received permission to combine the disciplines of anthropology, sociology and social psychology into a single department. The birth, life and death of this department, called the Department of Social Relations, are described in detail in Patrick L. Schmidt&rsquo;s new book <em>Harvard&rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science</em>.</p> <p class="p6">It is no coincidence that Social Relations opened its doors after the Second World War, a conflict whose origins and implications Harvard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; &ndash; the disciplines of history, economics and government &ndash; struggled to explain. Social Relations not only copied an interdisciplinary model already in use at other Ivy Leagues, but also gave faculty the freedom to pursue emerging theories and areas of study that were not receiving adequate attention inside their respective departments.</p> <p class="p6">The department of psychology was especially narrowminded in this regard. Prior to the establishment of Social Relations, psychology at Harvard was dominated by experimental psychologists. They were called &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; not because they were interested in exploring uncharted territory, but because they wanted to study the human mind through observable behaviour only, pushing professors Henry Murray and Gordon Allport &ndash; interested in invisible mental processes &ndash; to join Social Relations.</p> <p class="p6">Schmidt captures the intellectual drama that accompanied the development of the department. Conflicts of interest or ideas are thoroughly explained and livened up with quotes from faculty. Especially memorable is the recollection of Allport&rsquo;s awkward meeting with Sigmund Freud, whose fixation with the unconscious bothered him almost as much as Harvard&rsquo;s focus on behaviour.</p> <p class="p6">In theory, Social Relations was meant to be an interdisciplinary program. In practice, it was more multidisciplinary, with students and teachers sticking to their primary disciplines. One of the department&rsquo;s founders, sociologist Talcott Parsons, wrote <em>Towards a General Theory of Social Action</em> in an attempt to unify the discipline, and create <br>&ldquo;social relations&rdquo; as a new science, but the social psychologists in the department remained unconvinced, as did many sociologists.</p> <p class="p6">Why write a book about a failed intellectual project? Firstly, because of what was achieved along the way. Internal division did not stop the Department of Social Relations from delivering outstanding scholarship. As the Iron Curtain dropped, the department&rsquo;s Russian Research Center provided Washington with intel on the Soviet Union. Led by anthropologist and Social Relations founder Clyde Kluckhohn, the centre studied all aspects of Soviet life to determine how it would respond to attacks from the American military. Scholars say it showed research can be politically motivated while still being academically sound.</p> <p class="p6">Social Relations disintegrated in the early 1970s when anthropology, sociology and social psychology were once again separated into their own departments. This was due in part to a PR crisis which ensued after professors Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) gave psilocybin and mescaline to undergraduates as part of their Harvard Psychedelic Project, promoting drug use on university grounds and establishing themselves as counterculture icons.</p> <p class="p6">At the time, the Leary-Alpert scandal damaged Social Relations&rsquo; credibility in the academic world. Today, with attitudes towards psychedelics changing and research into their medical and mental benefits resuming, the project&rsquo;s legacy is being reassessed. Equally controversial upon its inception &ndash; and retrospectively ahead of its time &ndash; was a 1968 course called Social Change in America, which examined imperialism, race and labour amid mounting student protests against the Vietnam War.</p> <p class="p6">Schmidt&rsquo;s book is not only an instructive story of intellectual hubris and academic scandal. It also offers insight into ongoing debates over education, knowledge, power and progress. The author&rsquo;s biography might seem unusual, as he is neither a historian nor a social scientist, but an attorney in Washington D.C. However, he was present on the scene, having written his honours thesis at Harvard on the history of Social Relations, just after the department&rsquo;s demise. The Social Relations department might have approved, given their open-minded approach to hiring people. For example, in 1959, the faculty welcomed David Riesman, a former lawyer who&rsquo;d entered academia through the virtue of his independent research. He went on to a fellowship at Yale where he wrote <em>The Lonely Crowd</em>, considered to be a landmark study of American character.</p> <p class="p6">In the case of <em>Harvard&rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science</em>, the unorthodox approach has borne fruit. Through meticulous research and compelling writing, Schmidt has taken a set of dry, inaccessible institutional records and turned them into a gripping intellectual drama. Best of all, he&rsquo;s managed to do so without sensationalising his subject or shying away from semantics. A must-read for anyone interested in how educational systems are developed and their effect on the way we view the world.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Remember when you were young, and you&#8217;d start frothing eagerly for Christmas on the day after Thanksgiving (or a bit before)? In my day, you&#8217;d get the Sears toy catalog in the Fall, and you&#8217;d obsessively study it day after day and make lists you&#8217;d leave for your parents to find. Now I was scarcely aware of the existence of the holiday until now. I guess I&#8217;m old and jaded.</p>

As I write, one third of Pakistan is underwater. Recently in <em>Science</em>, a team led by David Armstrong McKay published findings that indicate global warming has already passed the threshold for triggering five disastrous tipping points, from ice-sheet collapse to permafrost thaw. Even in temperate Britain, summer 2022 brought widespread drought and the highest temperatures the country has ever recorded. We &ndash; at least, &ldquo;we progressives&rdquo; &ndash; know this. Yet our default, when it comes to the natural environment, seems to be a long comfortable yawn. That stuff &ldquo;out there&rdquo;, the barely differentiated bird and plant life blurring beyond the car windows, isn&rsquo;t really worth getting to know, is it? We seem to assume it is a cultural and political dead zone, where nothing interesting could possibly happen.</p> <p class="p3">Yet we make an exception for big-scale nature. Shades of imperial heroics haunt TV expeditions to film rare, faraway species, or beautifully judged literary works in which middle-class white men go off alone to explore mountains, woods or rivers &ndash; othering even the natural environment. Of course, something is better than nothing. No one would deny that David Attenborough, or writers like Richard Deakin or Robert MacFarlane, have made a difference not only to the popularity of the natural world as entertainment, but to what we know about it. But still, this strikes a somewhat post-colonial note.</p> <p class="p3">That&rsquo;s not to make some insulting equivalence between the human suffering Britain and other countries have already inflicted, and the suffering being inflicted on our neighbour species today. But, while unchecked climate change will eventually destroy us all, the people who will suffer first and worst will be in the global south. And in both the recent imperial past and the near future, this damage results from a culture of othering. It is a dangerous nonsense to turn the world around us &ndash; like the people of that world &ndash; into something we don&rsquo;t need to bother with because it is both, in the immortal words of Father Ted, &ldquo;small: far away&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not from London,&rdquo; cry the hopelessly metropolitan protagonists of<em> Withnail and I</em> (1987), out of their depth in the rain-soaked Lake District. But of course they are: and the satire, rounded like all the best writing, shows their agreeable heedlessness, as they leave field gates open wide, solicit a poacher in public and prove unable even to feed themselves. The natural environment is neither tiny nor distant. Today&rsquo;s intellectual and, increasingly, popular cultures take the collapse of the global biosphere seriously. But not so the fact that the quotidian, vaguely apprehended British countryside is &ndash; for all of us here on these islands, right now, in every moment &ndash; our local natural environment. The countryside is what our urban areas sit within; and it&rsquo;s what sustains them.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">The countryside is anything but a-political</span></h2> <p class="p5">It&rsquo;s also an increasingly radicalised space, at the forefront of our collective attempts to manage the climate emergency. The Johnson administration was close to advocates of rewilding. Farming communities &ndash; particularly in the less wealthy parts of the country often selected for such projects, because land there costs less &ndash; see rewilding as a rich man&rsquo;s hobby which is pricing them out of existence. Some explicitly cite parallels with the paralegal process of enclosure, which culminated in the 18th century. This saw productive agriculture, and the livelihoods of ordinary people in rural communities, cleared away to make room for the hobby parks and model farms of the wealthy. As today&rsquo;s farmers point out, food comes ultimately from land, not factories; food security is an important part of biosecurity; and farming where we live slashes carbon-heavy food miles.</p> <p class="p3">The connection between land and food, though, often seems to be missing from rewilders&rsquo; thinking: perhaps because the reality, which is that we need to find ways to farm sustainably, is so complex. Connected thought is also missing from the commercial strategy of buying up productive farmland for carbon offset sinks. Changing ownership of a green space does not create more of it. Meanwhile, amid political chaos at Westminster, the environment appears to be low on the agenda. The short-lived Truss government was not interested even in greenwashing; her September mini-budget was seen by environmentalists as a clear &ldquo;attack on nature&rdquo;. Sunak&rsquo;s government reversed many of these measures &ndash; reinstating the ban on fracking and pledging more offshore wind &ndash; but ministers have repeatedly framed environmental issues as a sideshow. The early days of Sunak&rsquo;s premiership were dogged by controversy over his reluctance to attend the COP27 climate summit.</p> <p class="p3">So what&rsquo;s gone wrong? Why can we not fix our attention on the British countryside for long enough to think and act rationally in relation to it? More than we surely realise &ndash; and leaving aside the particular shamelessness of this new governmental asset-stripping &ndash; this has to do with our culture. If we think of our natural environment as remote, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so often presented that way. When William Morris designed his wallpapers and fabrics, in which vines and roses become a repeating frieze, he was developing what he understood as good socialist practice. In his workshops, craftsmen and women could earn their living in ways that allowed them to further their skills, and to take ownership of the (improved) results.</p> <p class="p3">Yet it was adoption in the nation&rsquo;s gift shops that finally made these designs ubiquitous &ndash; as symbols, ironically, of middle-class Britain. We no longer hear, in their handmade origins, the echo of earlier movements seeking to afford workers self-sufficiency, such as Chartism. Instead, we fall back on thinking of workers and their rights as necessarily urban. That we do so is another consequence of enclosure because the ordinary people it displaced into cities became cheap labour for the industrial revolution&rsquo;s &ldquo;dark Satanic mills.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">That famous phrase comes from the Romantic poet William Blake (in &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s something of an irony that, at the very time these upheavals were taking place, Romanticism was advancing ideas of human rights centering on the inalienable status of the self as a human. We take for granted the ideas of liberty and equality, if not fraternity, that were first linked by Fran&ccedil;ois F&eacute;nelon at the dawn of the Enlightenment; they took their first steps onto the political stage with the Romantic-era French Revolution. On this side of the Channel, political philosophers including William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, politicised intellectuals Thomas Jefferson Hogg and James Leigh Hunt, and writers and activists including Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, were arguing for a person-centred dismantling of traditional institutions, including monarchy and marriage, and a recourse to personal judgment rather than social and religious obedience.</p> <h2 class="p3">Let's learn from the Romantics</h2> <p class="p3">So the fine-tuned Romantic &ldquo;sensibility&rdquo; the more conservative Jane Austen mocked in <em>Sense and Sensibility </em>(1811) and <em>Northanger Abbey </em>(1817) was more than self-indulgence. It was a form of heightened awareness underpinned by political philosophy. The Tory governments of the early 19th century effectively stamped out revolutionary thought, not least by repeated suspensions of habeas corpus and the right to a fair trial. This posed a threat for those it deemed subversives: many, including the Leigh Hunts and the Shelleys, went into political exile in Europe. And it&rsquo;s this, rather than mere emotion or artistic expression, that&rsquo;s actually going on in those Romantic representations of the natural environment which are so often, paradoxically, co-opted to present the British countryside as picturesque, old-fashioned and unchanging. In fact, these representations were urgently new: and they were created in response to an era of rapid change.</p> <p class="p3">Look again and the evidence is everywhere, as I rediscovered recently in writing and thinking about the Romantic encounter with the countryside. William Wordsworth &ldquo;wandered lonely as a cloud&rdquo; because the countryside was newly depopulated, and the sense you get when you&rsquo;re alone in the high fells is vertiginous &ndash; like looking up into a nearly cloudless sky and wondering why you don&rsquo;t fall up into it. John Constable&rsquo;s Dedham Vale, away from the worker community at Flatford Mill, is empty for the same reason, as the solitary observer becomes newly aware of every rustle or squeak. J. M. W. Turner&rsquo;s wide horizons record this too, as up to date in their way as his brilliant portrayal of speed on Maidenhead viaduct in <em>Wind, Steam, Speed</em>. Percy Bysshe Shelley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to the West Wind&rdquo; takes a high wind in Florence as an occasion to evoke the human &ndash; and ecological &ndash; potential for change and revolution.</p> <p class="p5">What I&rsquo;m saying, then, is that in a time of crisis we need to pay attention to everything surrounding us. Not only our natural environment, but our culture. We should keep a particular eye on ideas so familiar we think they&rsquo;re our own. Our assumptions about the countryside have held us back from paying attention to catastrophes unfolding there in plain sight. Such assumptions emerge from historical and cultural circumstance. They are the reason we shouldn&rsquo;t ignore historical moments like Romanticism, which have shaped our relationship with rural life, and which therefore cannot be &ldquo;over and done&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">Close up, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the Wordsworths in Somerset &ndash; or Lord Byron and the Shelleys in Switzerland &ndash; probably splashed about in country mud just as helplessly as Bruce Robinson&rsquo;s Withnail. But the lesson of Romanticism itself &ndash; rather than our reception of it as decorative clich&eacute; &ndash; must be its fearlessness in taking the rural environment as a site of and for radical rethinking. We too need to become unafraid of the proximity of the countryside: as the series of lived realities with which, even in town, we all relate. And if an increasingly authoritarian government claims that paying attention to such things is both uneconomic and impractical &ndash; arts and humanities, anyone? &ndash; perhaps we need to ask ourselves whose version of the natural environment, as of things in general, we are meant unquestioningly to accept.</p> <p class="p2"><em>Fiona Sampson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Starlight Wood: Walking Back to the Romantic Countryside&rdquo; is published by Hachette</em></p> <p class="p2"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Before I risk a trip to the bathroom, I check that my surgically replaced ankle is in good working order by standing on one leg for several seconds. Then I need a few minutes of running on the spot to prove that my newly fitted pacemaker is ticking over nicely.<br><br>These are only the more dramatic signs. They sit alongside more mundane evidence of physical deterioration: an anxiety about biting into apples, a refusal to run for buses, a declining capacity to throw up both arms in any sort of exultation, and a distinct unreadiness to bend down in a public place and tie up my shoelaces. <br><br>But all these corporeal concerns count for little when set against my new existential discovery. It can be simply stated: I never, ever, never, ever want to go on holiday again. I don&rsquo;t want to spend so much as a single night in a small hotel in Paris, or a fat villa in Antibes. I don&rsquo;t want to travel several thousand miles in order to look at tropical birds and a basking hippopotamus. I don&rsquo;t want to sit on a yacht, walk the Pilgrims&rsquo; Way or be sculled through Venice by a singing gondolier. <br><br>This new-found reluctance to leave home has nothing to do with any anxiety about the customary hassles of travelling. It is entirely prompted by a recent aversion to nearly every one of the delights that are so regularly reported by friends who have returned from holiday. The more they tell me about their vacation, the more my resolution is stiffened.<br><br>Here, for example, on my writing desk, is a recently received picture of Michael and Janet lounging on white plastic sun-beds beside a blue swimming pool somewhere in the south of France. &ldquo;We are really away from it all at last,&rdquo; runs the self-congratulatory message. The photo is in perfectly focused glossy Technicolor, but all I can see is an encroaching greyness: the perceptual deprivation induced by having nothing to stare at for hour after hour apart from a stretch of flat chlorinated water and the constant fear of losing your lounger when you depart to grab some buffet lunch.</p> <p>But far more relevant to my new resolution is this report from Charlotte and James. They&rsquo;re an acerbic couple, always alert to hypocrisy and double standards. But still they can&rsquo;t wait to tell me in an email that &ldquo;Yesterday we visited the magnificent cathedral. Such a solemn and holy place, with crowds of worshippers before the renowned statue of the Virgin Mary. An unforgettable experience!&rdquo; <br><br>And Charlotte and James are hardly alone. Over the years, dozens of my agnostic and atheist friends who would normally no more visit a holy building than volunteer to tour the local abattoir have reported in rapturous tone on their &ldquo;delightful&rdquo; visits to foreign churches and abbeys and monasteries. But more than that. They&rsquo;ve told me in detail about the wonders of attending religious processions and parades. &ldquo;Laurie. If you look closely at the head of the procession you can see the casket that is said to contain a splinter from the Holy Cross.&rdquo;<br><br>But I suspect that none of these factors contribute so much to my abhorrence of holidays as my loss of a critical cognitive faculty. To put it simply, I no longer have the mental capacity to pretend that matters are really better than they actually are, to simulate my delight at a merely average French seaside restaurant, or a garish Italian sunset, or an over-extended Portuguese fado, or the discovery that my hotel room bears only a parodic reference to the one featured in the brochure. I can only recall Robert Robinson&rsquo;s astute observation that wherever you stay on holiday will always be less comfortable than your home.<br><br>All in all, I have far more sensible and reasonable matters to attend to than a holiday. Tomorrow, for example, I intend to practise standing on my head.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter </em><em>2022 </em><em>edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/rowsonsmall.jpg" height="1663" alt="Martin Rowson cartoon on the origins of life in deep sea vents" width="1920"></p> <p>The origin of life is such a fabled event (more than 4 billion years ago) that searching for clues on the Earth today might seem a fool&rsquo;s errand. But, piece by piece, a wonderfully interlocking skein of evidence is emerging. It began with a chance encounter in the deep ocean.<br><br>In 1977, the deep-sea submersible research vessel Alvin discovered hot upwelling mineral vents &ndash; black smokers &ndash; in the deep Pacific Ocean, off the coast of California. Such upwellings occur near the boundaries of the Earth&rsquo;s tectonic plates where there is volcanic activity. The streams that pour out are hot water laced with minerals that then accumulate and grow into rocky towers. The interest of biologists and biochemists was piqued by the constant flow of hot, chemically rich effluents, which suggested that this might be life&rsquo;s birthplace. <br><br>The energetic chemistry discovered in the black smokers bore some resemblance to the energy metabolism of modern cells, especially in the presence of iron-sulphur clusters. These clusters lie at the heart of many of life&rsquo;s nanomachines &ndash; large protein complexes, often with moving parts &ndash; that perform life&rsquo;s key functions (see my article &ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s Nanomachines&rdquo; in the Spring 2021 edition of <em>New Humanist</em>). <br><br>Black smokers proved to be a dead end: they were too hot and unstable to have been a source of early life. However, the idea that deep sea vents might point to the secret of the origin of life was taken up by other researchers. <br><br>In 1988, the geochemist Mike Russell, at Glasgow University, predicted the existence of another kind of hydrothermal vent: alkaline, and much cooler. This vent, he hypothesised, could have used hydrogen spewing from the effluents to react with dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean waters, creating the precursor chemicals of life. In fact, Russell made the claim: &ldquo;The purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide&rdquo;.<br><br>This may sound grandiose &ndash; but as it turned out, Russell was correct. In December 2000, mysterious white chimney structures, now dubbed the Lost City, were found by chance by the same submersible vessel on the mid-Atlantic seafloor. (The very best science is done like this: a prediction &ndash; often seemingly improbable &ndash; followed by the clinching discovery.)<br><br>The most exciting revelation of the calcium carbonate chimneys, which are up to 60m tall, was their porous structure. Each has many tiny holes like a mineralised sponge, through which, as Russell predicted, alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen and minerals really do pour into an acidic ocean which contains dissolved CO2 (the ocean is mildly acidic now, but it was much more so 4 billion years ago). In primeval conditions, these vents could have spawned and harboured the necessary ingredients and the right conditions to promote the growth of biomass. It seems that we might have finally found the birthplace of life on Earth.</p> <h2>"Life is a river that never stalls"</h2> <p>Over the last two decades, much work has been done on deep-sea vents. There is a striking similarity between their chemistry and the biochemistry of primitive bacteria which still exist today and can live on purely chemical substances. As a result, we now have a detailed and highly plausible account of how life probably arose. These are exciting times, but the science is complex and difficult to explain to the general public. <br><br>Thankfully, one of the researchers working on the origin of life is also an excellent communicator. Nick Lane, professor of evolutionary biochemistry at University College London, has been working on the question of what life is, and how it began, for more than a decade. Most biologists see life in terms of information encoded by DNA, but Lane focuses on the flow of energy through living things. In his latest book, <em>Transformer</em>, which came out in May 2022, he writes that his aim is to &ldquo;explain how the flow of energy and matter structures the evolution of life and even genetic information. I want to turn the standard view upside down.&rdquo;<br><br>An analogy for Lane&rsquo;s view of life can be found in rivers. A river is only a river if it is in motion, and that motion requires energy. Rivers are not only water, just as living things are not only the chemicals that comprise them. In every living cell, chemical matter is incessantly in motion to a frantic degree. Humans die very quickly if oxygen is withdrawn, but what kills us is not suffocation but a collapse of the energy flow through every cell. <br>Living things need fuel to power the metabolism of life. They get this by trading gases with the environment: for plants in today&rsquo;s world, that means CO2 in, oxygen out, and the reverse for animals. Life is reproduced through DNA. But the puzzle has always been to discover how primitive chemistry could have led to intricate biochemistry in the first place. Darwin memorably mused on the subject of the origin of life:</p> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;But if (and oh what a big if) we could conceive in some warm little pond with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity etcetera present, that a protein compound was chemically formed, ready to undergo still more complex changes.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>This seemed unlikely, because in open water any interesting chemistry would quickly be dispersed &ndash; a drop in the ocean is more than a metaphor here. However, we can now hypothesise that this is where the deep-sea vents came into play. They could have provided a shelter in their pores in which useful molecules could accumulate in the unceasing flow. Over millions of years, the constancy of the same upwellings satisfies the &ldquo;life is a river that never stalls&rdquo; requirement. <br><br>But what on the primeval Earth could have enabled the vital reaction between CO2 and hydrogen? This is the problem that Lane&rsquo;s lab and others have been working on. In 2020, a research team led by Lane&rsquo;s former student Victor Sojo, with Reuben Hudson, managed to mimic conditions in the primordial vents. They demonstrated that an energy gradient that exists in the vents between the alkaline effluents and the acid ocean was indeed capable of hydrogenating CO2. Other labs are producing similar results, confirming what was long suspected but difficult to prove. Lane says: &ldquo;I take my hat off to them&rdquo;.</p> <h2>The beginning of natural selection</h2> <p>If the first requirement of life is the hydrogenation of CO2, what is needed next? All life today is composed of cells and new life can now only come into being through the division of living cells. Cells are cells because they are bounded by a membrane &ndash; a barrier between the non-living outside world and the living interior (or between one cell and another). <br><br>Cell membranes are made from fatty acids which behave like detergents in that one end of the molecule is water repellent and one end is water loving. In the reactions that occur in the vents, long-chain fatty acids would have formed easily. It&rsquo;s a simple lab demonstration to show that these fatty acids will self-assemble into bilayer spheres in water, with the fatty ends butting together, separating the watery world inside from the watery world outside. <br><br>So the idea is that the pores in the chimneys were a template for protocells with this bilayer structure. This was the beginning of the metabolism that powers all cells today. The minerals that pour out of the vents have catalytic properties and would have created a positive feedback loop in which the protocells that could fix more carbon would come to dominate the vents. This was the beginning of natural selection.<br><br>In <em>Transformer</em>, Lane demonstrates the centrality of this metabolism to all life in a suite of reactions that goes by the name of the Krebs Cycle, after the great biochemist Hans Krebs (1900-1981). The textbook Krebs Cycle describes oxygen &ldquo;burning&rdquo; glucose to provide energy and to create the basic biomass of life, whilst emitting CO2 in the process. It is at the heart of the way that animals like us live and move and exist. Ironically, Lane&rsquo;s first encounter with learning about the cycle was unpropitious. &ldquo;I did biology and chemistry at school and loved them both and thought that combination was perfect but I did biochemistry at university and hated it,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;hated it because I was told to memorise pathways off by heart.&rdquo;<br><br>It turned out that this rote learning was not only tedious and unhelpful. It also sold the Krebs Cycle short. The cycle had already been revealed, back in 1966, to be more complicated than the textbook version. It was capable of working backwards, starting with CO2 and creating biomass from the products of that first reaction with hydrogen. As is often the way, however, this concept was resisted by the research community for more than 20 years. <br><br>The reverse Krebs Cycle is now fully recognised and is vital to the hypothesis that life may have emerged from the deep-sea vents, long before the existence of DNA or its cousin RNA. <br><br>This is highly promising, but as Lane himself admits in <em>Transformer</em>, &ldquo;many a beautiful idea has been killed by ugly facts&rdquo;. The search for life&rsquo;s greatest prizes has always been tortuous, but many teams of researchers are working to confirm Lane&rsquo;s ideas experimentally. He makes sure, in the book, to fully acknowledge the work of his PhD students and post-doctoral researchers. Great strides are being made, but more hard evidence is needed.</p> <p>The overriding idea of the vent hypothesis is that the chemistry that existed in the pores of the vents was eventually interiorised by the protocells that nestled within them. In a thrilling recent experiment in Lane&rsquo;s lab, Sean Jordan and Hanadi Rammu discovered that protocells form particularly readily in simulated vent conditions. The amino acid cysteine, mixed with iron and sulphides found in the vents, produced exactly the kind of iron-sulphur clusters at the heart of modern protein enzymes.</p> <h2>Did the origins of life involve DNA?</h2> <p>One area of research is revealing how the deep-sea vents might have produced the molecule ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the universal fuel of life, powering every move we make and every internal process in all living things. Lane&rsquo;s PhD researcher Silvana Pinna is investigating how this vital molecule might have originated in the hydrothermal vents. <br><br>In the very early stages of the vents, the chemicals formed would have been tiny molecules with only a handful of atoms. Life in its developed form uses giant molecules &ndash; long chains wound into a double helix in DNA or folded into intricate structures in proteins. Pinna has shown that the simple molecule acetyl phosphate can catalyse the formation of ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and that this reaction is chemically favoured under hydrothermal conditions. The paper by Pinna and her colleagues, recently published by the journal PLOS Biology, concludes:</p> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;This implies that ATP could have become the universal energy currency of life not as the endpoint of genetic selection or as a frozen accident, but for fundamental chemical reasons.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>Other researchers, such as Markus Ralser, the Einstein professor of biochemistry at the Einstein Foundation in Berlin, are producing similar results in finding purely chemical routes to the basic building blocks of life. Lane told me: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s great about Markus&rsquo;s work is that he&rsquo;s brought attention to something that he calls the &lsquo;end product problem&rsquo;.&rdquo; This poses the apparently awkward fact that the intermediate stages of the Krebs cycle only make sense when they are all in place. Both Ralser&rsquo;s and Lane&rsquo;s labs have found that Krebs and other key intermediates occur in sequence by simple chemistry alone, as opposed to the chemistry that can only be performed in living things today by the complex protein enzymes in every living cell. <br><br>Such chemistry, with that river metaphor in mind, is as natural as water flowing downstream. It&rsquo;s the chemistry of reactions that happen by necessity, as when hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water, or sodium with chlorine to form sodium chloride. The success of work like this leads Lane to suggest: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to believe that the whole of biochemistry up to nucleotide synthesis just happens spontaneously . . . It&rsquo;s just built into the chemistry of CO2&rdquo;. <br><br>This is a remarkable conclusion, overturning the generally held assumption that the origin of life must have had something to do with DNA or its cousin RNA.</p> <h2>"Tornado in the junkyard"</h2> <p>Life originating by purely chemical means was once considered so far-fetched that the astronomer Fred Hoyle compared it, in 1983, to &ldquo;the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747&rdquo;. But it seems that the currents that flow though the hydrothermal vents really are the &ldquo;tornado in the junkyard&rdquo;, able to create some of life&rsquo;s early metabolism.<br><br>This theory could also solve the problem of how DNA originated. Today, new life is produced by coding from DNA, but a code can&rsquo;t predate the thing coded for. How did it emerge in the first place? The genetic code by which DNA spells out the composition of proteins is regarded by some as a frozen accident &ndash; there seems no rhyme or reason to it, like the Morse code, which could just as well have a completely different pattern of dots and dashes. But a recent paper published in the journal Biochimica et Biophysica Acta &ndash; Bioenergetics by Lane&rsquo;s PhD students &ndash; Stuart Harrison, Raquel Nunes Palmeira and Aaron Halpern &ndash; shows how the genetic code most likely evolved.<br><br>They have discovered that the nucleotide bases that form DNA and its more primordial cousin RNA actually have a direct chemical affinity for particular amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The early little strings of nucleotides &ndash; forerunners of the great chains of RNA and DNA &ndash; had no coding function: in the first instance, they were catalysts, just like the iron-sulphur clusters before them and the protein enzymes that succeeded them. But then, depending on their position in the reverse Krebs cycle, particular amino acids became associated with one or other of the four RNA bases. <br><br>The authors of the paper conclude by noting that coding &ndash; biological information encoded in genes &ndash; thus emerged by chemical necessity. The genetic code wasn&rsquo;t imposed on life, but evolved alongside it. The theory &ldquo;offers a framework that enables the transition from deterministic chemistry to genetic information at the origin of life&rdquo; [my italics]. This is a conclusion as dramatic as that of Watson and Crick&rsquo;s iconic 1953 paper, in which they posited that DNA was the means through which life was reproduced.<br><br>Since the discovery of DNA, inquiries into the origin of life have tended to focus on how DNA replication and the genetic code originated. How could complex life have begun to develop without such a code? We may now be opening a new chapter in biology that turns our assumptions upside down. The work of Lane and his colleagues shows that the complex lifeforms that exist on Earth today may have evolved from simple beginnings. The systems that power these lifeforms may seem bafflingly sophisticated, but they could have evolved by purely chemical means. Now, we see how, from the ever-pulsing currents on the primeval ocean floor, life could have booted itself up.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>

<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
