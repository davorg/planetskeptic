<p class="lead">I&#8217;m in trouble now. I was late reading some official email, and learned (was reminded) yesterday that I have to submit my annual report describing what I&#8217;ve been doing for the past year. The report is due on 20 March…oh. Yesterday.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d learn. This has been a bureaucratic ritual every year for 23 years, and I should learn to expect it. First comes my birthday, which is OK; then comes my wedding anniversary, which is very nice; then comes spring break, which is excellent; and then…darkness descends on my consciousness, and my brain averts away from the cursed next step of administrative paperwork.</p>
<p>OK. I&#8217;ve pulled up the form on my computer. Now I have to go through my old records and remind myself of what I did in 2022. Then I have to justify my existence, despite the howling void at my core telling me that I don&#8217;t deserve to live and nothing I have ever done matters.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get it done today somehow.</p>

What? No wonder Iowa is screwed up.</p></div>
<p class="lead">The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/03/20/iowa-trump-gay-rights/">Washington Post noticed</a>. Even as Minnesota has been progressing and enacting common sense legislation to improve the life of its citizens, our neighbor to the South, Iowa, has been going insane.</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans in the Iowa legislature, empowered by the state’s recent “red wave,” have embarked on an ambitious new agenda that includes a costly school choice bill and legislation targeting the LGBTQ community, a historic divergence from Iowa’s history as a civil rights bastion.</p>
<p>Even as teens draped in rainbow flags crowded into the Capitol rotunda chanting “We say gay” on March 8, Iowa lawmakers quickly passed three bills related to gay and transgender rights, culminating with a measure to ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth that is awaiting Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’s signature.</p>
<p>The votes were not only emphatic but were also a sharp reversal for the state: Iowa has veered so far to the right in recent years that its political landscape is virtually unrecognizable from the centrist place that chose Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and was one of the earliest states in the country to affirm same-sex marriage. A joke among statehouse reporters is that Iowa is becoming the “Florida of the North” — without the beaches.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once you let Republicans get a toe-hold in your state, they start screaming and fostering a climate of hatred and paranoia that takes over, and next thing you know you&#8217;re getting compared to Florida. I don&#8217;t understand this transformation myself, but somehow, working class people in Iowa have absorbed a lot of Republican propaganda and have gotten the idea that Trump was a hero.</p>
<blockquote><p>Political analysts in the state say that Iowa’s swing has solidified over the past seven years as reliably Democratic working-class voters abandoned the party in favor of Donald Trump’s message, and the state’s large percentage of independent voters also moved toward the Republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trump&#8217;s message? What the fuck <em>is</em> Trump&#8217;s message? And why does it appeal to anyone? The article doesn&#8217;t say. If that &#8220;message&#8221; is represented by Governor Kim Reynolds, well yuck &#8212; it&#8217;s all hate and ignorance.</p>
<blockquote><p>At a February appearance at a raucous town hall co-sponsored by Moms for Liberty — the Florida-based group that has campaigned for book bans across the country — Reynolds celebrated her school choice victory and portrayed herself both as a grandma of 11 and a warrior against the “radical left.”</p>
<p>“They think patriotism is racist and pornographic library books are education,” Reynolds said, speaking over shouting protesters and supporters chanting “U.S.A., U.S.A.” “They believe that the content of our character is less important than the color of our skin. They believe that children should be encouraged to pick their gender and the parents, well, they’re just in the way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Love how the one thing Republicans have stolen from Martin Luther King Jr. is that one line, and they&#8217;ve twisted it to support their assertion that white people are discriminated against. She&#8217;s got everything backwards, though: Republicans think racism is patriotism and education is pornography.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="'How far are these books mere fantasies?'" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/petr-sidorov-GESOWH4YLRI-unsplash.jpg" height="1182" alt="Tarot cards" width="1773"></p> <p>I&rsquo;ve been spending these dark winter nights immersing myself in so-called &ldquo;witch lit&rdquo; &ndash; reading four of the many new books about witches published in the last year or so. My generation of 20-somethings enjoyed our fair share of feminist necromancy, with the TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer and hit films like The Craft coming out in the mid-90s. I wanted to know what the current trend for witchy novels and non-fiction revealed about the tastes and dreams of today&rsquo;s young women. How far are these books mere fantasies &ndash; wrapped up in social media-fuelled new age mumbo jumbo about tarot readings and manifestations &ndash; and how far are they grounded in genuine engagement with historical misogyny and patriarchal superstition?</p> <p>In a change from traditional Gothic imagery, I noticed that some of these books are packaged in bright candy-coloured covers; acid pink in the case of Weyward, Emilia Hart&rsquo;s much-heralded debut novel. Following three generations of English women in one family &ndash; in a 17th-century witch trial, the 1940s and the modern day &ndash; it does a good job of grappling with the idea that patriarchy and misogyny endure, even if they change their masks. But although I liked the idea of women having an animal affinity with the natural world of insects and reptiles, the novel has the fundamental problem of imagining witchcraft at some level, however benign, to be real.</p> <p>Kirsty Logan&rsquo;s Now She is Witch takes a more metaphysical approach, with echoes of the fantasy world of Game of Thrones or The Lord of the Rings, yet it is more satisfyingly realistic. Set in an impressionistic and non-specific Nordic mediaeval Europe, the heroine Lux navigates a theocratic Christian land of witch-burnings, exorcisms, controlling priests and superstitious warrior kings, where the only certainty is that women will be blamed for all wrongs.</p> <p>Logan&rsquo;s evocation of woman-hating perhaps draws on a growing popular knowledge of Scotland&rsquo;s disturbing record of witch-hunting in the 16th and 17th centuries, powered by King James I&rsquo;s (James VI of Scotland) obsession with them and his book Daemonologie. Scotland executed at least 2,500 people &ndash; overwhelmingly women &ndash; for alleged witchcraft. This was proportionally more than anywhere else in Europe and America. Scotland&rsquo;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made a formal apology for the murders in March last year.</p> <p>The King of Denmark and Norway even imported Scottish witchfinders &ndash; a fact I learned reading Anya Bergman&rsquo;s impressive historically researched novel The Witches of Vardo, about the torture and murder of women there in the 1662-3 witch trials. The book evokes the superstitious madness of that era, with peasant women from fishing villages on the wild coast blamed for conjuring up storms that downed ships with valuable cargoes. Bergman emphasises the persecution of the Sami native people of the region, incorporating their own legends and ideas of healing into a story that inspired me to find out more about the real events. And, controversially, she imagines a sympathetic interpretation of the role of a real female figure, Anna Rhodius, demonised in historical accounts for her part in the convictions.</p> <p>Against all this fiction, I also read a factual account of witch hunts that reads with the fluency of a novel. With all this interest in witch-lit, perhaps it&rsquo;s no coincidence that The Ruin of All Witches: Life and Death in the New World, published in 2021, came back onto the UK bestseller charts in January. Historian Malcolm Gaskill tells the full story of a 1651 witch hunt in Springfield, Connecticut &ndash; from first accusation to trial and verdict. This was 40 years before the Salem trials.</p> <p>Crucially, Gaskill writes to make us see the world as those early Puritans saw it; how their own psychological fears, of financial ruin, of neighbours, of Native Americans and the hostile elements, could seed the first accusations of witchcraft through how they interpreted their dreams: &ldquo;The minds of sleeping colonists were transported to a place where the wilderness met the invisible realm and received supernatural revelations encoded as symbols of civility and savagery: angels and serpents. Here the devil turned fantasy into fact and made witches of the weak.&rdquo;</p> <p>Gaskill&rsquo;s book cover is even in the same acid pink as Hart&rsquo;s Weyward. The latter, like the other novels I&rsquo;ve discussed, is fantasy. But, to their credit, all are rooted in this generation&rsquo;s advanced awareness of real-life patriarchy, and the desire of these young women to connect to the historical misogyny endured by their ancestors.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p class="lead">Minnesota has a Democratic governor and a Democratic house, and that means…<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/kids-embrace-minnesota-gov-tim-walz-after-he-signs-free-school-meals-into-law/ar-AA18N6QC">children get fed</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kids and parents in Minnesota won’t have to worry about affording school meals thanks to a new law that guarantees free school meals for all children in the state.</p>
<p>Gov. Tim Walz (D) signed the bill into law Friday to cheers and hugs from some of the kids who will benefit from the program.</p>
<p>The new law provides free breakfast and lunch for all K-12 students, regardless of their parents’ income.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you were wondering what the benefits of helping kids might be, <a href="">here&#8217;s an explanation</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>One study published in 2020 looked at the adoption of universal school meals in middle schools in New York City that occurred in different years for different schools. The researchers focused on changes in test scores for individual students followed over time. They paid special attention to the comparison of students previously eligible for free meals due to their family’s low income status versus those students who were not previously being offered free meals.</p>
<p>After each school started to offer free meals to all students, test scores increased in both English and math. While test scores went up for both low-income students and those who were not from low-income households, the students who were not previously eligible for free meals benefited more.  The gains in test scores for the students whose families had higher incomes or were missing out on free meals due to problems with certifying eligibility was estimated to represent six to 10 weeks of learning.</p>
<p>Another examination of data from NYC found an improvement in attendance for kindergartners once all students were offered free meals.</p>
<p>More recently, a 2022 study  looked at the adoption of universal free meals by school districts across the U.S. Using district-level test scores rather than test scores on individual students, the author also found that the decision to offer universal free school meals was followed by an increase in math scores. A comparison of districts with high levels of poverty to those with lower poverty levels found that the math score gains were greater in districts that had fewer students from low-income households. In other words, school districts with fewer low-income students experienced the greatest improvements in math scores.</p></blockquote>
<p>What happens if you put Republicans in charge? They deny the problem and do nothing.</p>
<blockquote><p>The bill drew the ire of Republican state Sen. Steve Drazkowski, who argued Tuesday that “hunger is a relative term” in his opposition to feeding kids.</p>
<p>“I have yet to meet a person in Minnesota that is hungry,” Drazkowski said on the Senate floor in St. Paul before voting against the legislation. “I have yet to meet a person in Minnesota that says they don’t have access to enough food to eat.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that says more about the elite circles he moves in than anything about the state of the citizenry.  Why isn&#8217;t everyone eating cake?</p>
<p>By the way, Minnesota also <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-house-oks-allowing-drivers-license-for-undocumented-immigrants/600247881/?refresh=true">allowed immigrants, <em>all</em> immigrants, to get a driver&#8217;s license</a>, which is sensible, good news for everyone who uses our roads and highways.</p>
<blockquote><p>A bill to allow unauthorized immigrants to obtain a driver&#8217;s license without showing proof of legal residence was passed by the Minnesota House of Representatives on Monday.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Driver&#8217;s Licenses for All&#8221; bill passed in the House by a vote of 69-60.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you keep Republicans out of power, you&#8217;ll get all kinds of nice incremental improvements to your life.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Survival-of-the-Richest.jpg" height="696" alt="The book's cover shows an island against an orange backdrop" width="431"></strong></p> <p><strong>Survival of the Richest: Escape fantasies of the tech billionaires</strong> (Scribe) by Douglas Rushkoff</p> <p>It&rsquo;s difficult for a book to live up to the racy subtitle &ldquo;Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires&rdquo;. This is the problem with which professor of media theory and digital economics Douglas Rushkoff saddles himself. His book, entertaining and necessary though it is, never quite lives up to its marketing. The subject is tech billionaires and &ldquo;The Mindset&rdquo; with which they tackle the problems of the world. In the author&rsquo;s eyes, The Mindset is the belief that with enough money, the elite can leave behind the messy debris of real life and start afresh, either in the real world or in some kind of virtual reality. He phrases it elsewhere as &ldquo;the Insulation Equation&rdquo;: can the tech titans &ldquo;earn enough money to insulate themselves from the reality they were creating by earning money in this way?&rdquo; Hence Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s Metaverse and the attempts made by both Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to blast themselves into space.</p> <p>Rushkoff is onto something here, and he has great fun skewering the pomposity of these men. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if they want to build a car that goes fast enough to escape from its own exhaust,&rdquo; he writes. He quotes psychedelics professor Timothy Leary who observed, back in 1990, that the architects of our digital future were male nerds attempting to create something like their idea of a perfect woman: &ldquo;a predictive algorithm could anticipate their every need in advance and deliver it directly, removing every trace of friction and longing&rdquo;. At no point in the book are you in any doubt as to where Rushkoff stands. His villains are so cartoonish that we remain on his side, but there is sometimes a little too much scorn and not enough substance.</p> <p>Survival of the Richest includes pertinent paragraphs about Covid-19, underlining both the extent to which the super-rich could simply exist happily in their own bubbles and the fact that the conditions of the pandemic not only made billionaires richer but also produced brand-new billionaires. The unprecedented disruption was proof that if the richest people in the world didn&rsquo;t want to interact with the poorest, they simply didn&rsquo;t have to.</p> <p>Rushkoff is right not to trust the heads of the &ldquo;technopoly&rdquo;, who conquer, colonise and dominate. Theirs is a brutal quest for progress, valuing technology over people. &ldquo;The experience of wealth and power is akin to removing the part of the brain &lsquo;critical to empathy and socially appropriate behaviour&rsquo;,&rdquo; the author writes.</p> <p>This is all well and good &ndash; or all well and terrible, rather &ndash; but, given that Rushkoff&rsquo;s book begins with an enticing story in which he speaks at a &ldquo;super-deluxe resort&rdquo; to five ultra-wealthy tech bros who talk to him surprisingly candidly about their underground bunkers, it&rsquo;s a little pale by comparison. This opening hints at the insight and detail about the &ldquo;escape fantasies&rdquo; that we hope the book will provide. But as it proceeds, we get a passionate screed against Silicon Valley rather than an exclusive look at the ways tech billionaires are trying to dodge death.</p> <p>We&rsquo;ve got ourselves into a huge amount of trouble, Rushkoff thinks, and the people really running things want us never to get off the treadmill, generating more content, earning more money. Their goal is the &ldquo;relentless pursuit of growth&rdquo; &ndash; growth never questioned by the population at large. As speed becomes more important than anything else, AIs now increasingly carry out work that humans could or should &ndash; and the tech giants have become terrified of the potentially superior intelligence they have helped to create. Rushkoff&rsquo;s take on the whole affair is a weary and comic one, but there is also real sadness. The world, he thinks, could have been so much better than this.</p> <p>The book&rsquo;s proposed solutions have been criticised for not being sufficiently radical. But Rushkoff wouldn&rsquo;t argue that they were radical. What&rsquo;s necessary, he writes, is a return to a pre-Mindset metabolism; de-prioritisation of growth; slowing down. Reject growth for growth&rsquo;s sake, embrace community action, and stop making the ultra-rich even richer. &ldquo;There is no escape, and there is no later,&rdquo; he ends the book by saying. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re not doing it at the moment, we&rsquo;re not doing it at all.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Pete Krykant outside his safe consumption ambulance" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/drugs.jpg" height="712" alt="Pete Krykant outside his safe consumption ambulance in Glasgow" width="736"></p> <p>The UK has never had a drug consumption room. At least not officially. From August 2020, an unofficial one was run in Glasgow for around ten months by Peter Krykant. He invited people into the back of his makeshift ambulance, converted from a second-hand minibus, and gave them a safe space to inject cocaine and heroin. It is the closest the UK has come, despite having the highest rates of drug-related death in Europe.</p> <p>Injecting drugs is a risky activity &ndash; even when it is done in the carefully controlled environment of a hospital, with high-quality pharmaceuticals, experienced healthcare professionals and single-use sterile equipment. Injecting heroin in a filthy public toilet, by yourself, with someone else&rsquo;s needle, is often desperate. There is the risk of damage from the needle, infection from the re-used needle and syringe, and the fact that if it all goes wrong and you overdose, there is no one to help you. You&rsquo;ll die, despite the fact there is an easily administered and highly effective antidote.</p> <p>Drug-related death rates in England have been rising for a decade and now outstrip comparable tolls in Europe. The highest rates are across the north-east, while Blackpool in the north-west is a pocket of pain. Scotland, meanwhile, stands in a grim league of its own &ndash; the sick man of Europe, with 1,330 deaths related to drug misuse in 2021. Comparisons are complicated, but Scotland has about four times more deaths than the worst countries in Europe and, by some calculations, more than 20 times as many deaths as the EU average. It&rsquo;s carnage.</p> <p>Most of the risks are due to the illicit nature of drugs. There is no way of knowing the dose, no way of even knowing for sure if that brown substance is actually heroin, and you&rsquo;ll only find out how potent it is when it is coursing through your veins. Heroin, in the form sold on the street, needs to be dissolved in water, usually with the help of a little acid. If you are living on the streets, or in a squat, water isn&rsquo;t always easy to get and people use water from puddles, from toilet bowls, even their own saliva.</p> <p>Botulism, tetanus and necrotising fasciitis are regularly seen in people injecting drugs in the UK. Any re-use of needles is hazardous. Needles blunt quickly with use &ndash; ask any hapless soul who has been repeatedly stabbed by a junior doctor as they try to get blood. Blunt needles cause even more damage, tearing fragile veins and leaving them liable to clotting. And used needles can harbour hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. Often all three.</p> <h2>One man's mission</h2> <p>Krykant saw the urgent need to tackle the problem in Glasgow. He is an activist; not medically qualified but motivated by the insight from his own past experience of heroin addiction. Although his ambulance project was short-lived, it was effective. In less than a year, he supervised nearly 900 injections by 835 people and nine overdoses were tackled. No one died and lives were saved. On one occasion, he was arrested and charged under the Misuse of Drugs Act, but Scotland&rsquo;s public prosecutor dropped the case.</p> <p>His audacious, law-defying actions have galvanised activists. The push for drug consumption rooms is now at the leading edge of the drive for evidence-based harm-reduction interventions.</p> <p>Any human activity which could harm us, and that we are unlikely to stop despite those harms, can usually be squinted at through a harm-reduction lens. As it relates to drug use or laws, this means any policy or programme that reduces the negative effects. The approach is grounded in evidence, and aims to improve conditions both for the individuals concerned and for society. So who could possibly object?</p> <p>The chief opponents are those who believe that complete abstention and prohibition should be mandated. Arguably, peak abstention was reached in the 80s and 90s with the &ldquo;Just Say No&rdquo; advertising campaign championed in the United States by then-First Lady Nancy Reagan. But the prohibitionist &ldquo;War on Drugs&rdquo; continues to this day. And while there are those who don&rsquo;t believe any drug use is acceptable, others have variable thresholds and levels of tolerance.</p> <p>Drug consumption rooms are a case in point. The first was opened in Berne, Switzerland in 1986. They now exist in 16 countries around the world, with Greece, Iceland and Mexico recently joining well-established services in Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada &ndash; and, of course, Switzerland. The UK is lagging behind the rest of the world. Yet the picture is complex, as Britain has embraced other harm-reduction strategies &ndash; such as needle exchanges and methadone programmes.</p> <h2>A history of harm reduction</h2> <p>The UK has a proud history of harm-reduction activism, which can be traced back to the response in the 1980s to the emerging threat of HIV. There were several projects across the country, but two cities featured notably: Edinburgh and Liverpool. In Edinburgh, Roy Robertson, a GP and now Professor of Addiction Medicine, was involved in research that tested for HIV in the stored blood samples of 164 people who were known to be injecting drugs. The results were published in 1986 in the British Medical Journal. Just over half were found to be HIV positive. An obvious relationship had been found between sharing injecting equipment and the spread of HIV.</p> <p>This important research came at a time when community pharmacies were scaling back the provision of injecting equipment, apparently at the request of police who were also confiscating it. As a result, a tight-knit group of people were sharing syringes and needles &ndash; and, of course, the HIV virus. HIV was spiralling out of control and an urgent response was needed.</p> <p>Around this time, the public health team in Liverpool had become convinced of the need to establish needle exchange schemes to tackle the problem. Liverpool was one of the first British cities to establish such a scheme. The police also stopped arresting people for carrying the paraphernalia needed to inject drugs.</p> <p>This was a significant shift in approach: the need to stop the transmission of HIV had superseded the need to get people to stop using drugs. Methadone programmes were rolled out across the UK. In December 1986, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Services, Norman Fowler, announced money to bring people into addiction treatment and a nationwide pilot scheme of needle exchange. Harm reduction had come of age.</p> <p>The harm-reduction approach can lead to a virtuous cycle. The establishment of needle and syringe exchanges around the world has led to further opportunities to reduce damage, for example by supplying materials to help with safe injecting. Those injecing heroin usually need to get their hands on some form of acid. Addicts will use any available acid, including household vinegar, to help it dissolve, resulting in highly acidic solutions that are agonising to inject and can cause devastating damage to veins. Citric acid and vitamin C (ascorbic acid), in the right quantity, are now supplied in needle and syringe exchanges.</p> <p>Many exchanges will also supply disposable crack pipes. Cracked lips can bleed, and sharing crack pipes can lead to the transmission of hepatitis C, which is much more infectious than HIV. (In many parts of the UK, roughly half of people injecting drugs have been infected by the virus.)</p> <h2>Policy vs science</h2> <p>Harm reduction has been embraced in many parts of the world &ndash; which is unsurprising, given its alignment with human rights and the strong evidence base. But many countries still have limited access to these strategies. HIV remains a major problem. Fewer than one per cent of people who inject drugs are living in countries that meet the UN&rsquo;s recommendations on coverage for clean needles and access to opioid substitution therapy. In Eastern and Southern Africa, nearly 22 per cent of people who inject drugs are living with HIV. Compare that with England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where about one per cent of people who inject drugs are living with the condition, even though they often have long histories of injecting.</p> <p>But access isn&rsquo;t the only barrier. Attitudes to harm reduction vary around the world, in different countries and cultural contexts, and have waxed and waned over time. Some countries are very relaxed about giving out clean needles and syringes but don&rsquo;t think we should provide crack pipes. Others may be happy to give out crack pipes but will balk at opening drug consumption rooms.</p> <p>We can see what happens when a country takes a generally hostile approach to harm reduction. Russia not only remains resolutely opposed to offering opiate substitution in their own country, they have also used their position at the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs to block harm-reduction policy approaches at the international level. After the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014-15 and its occupation of parts of the Donbas, all harm-reduction services were closed in those areas and opiate substitution therapy was stopped. Obviously, all medical services in Ukraine have been severely impacted by the Russian invasion in February 2022. While some HIV and harm-reduction services have reportedly been re-established in Lviv, the overall effect will be devastating.</p> <p>Methadone has an evidence base that can scarcely be matched by any other medication. It&rsquo;s a long-acting opioid, designed to level out the boom-bust of short-acting heroin. It stops people oscillating wildly between withdrawal and intoxication, bringing stability and the opportunity to break the addiction cycle.</p> <p>However, it straddles &ndash; uncomfortably for some &ndash; a nebulous zone between harm reduction and abstinence. Some people who take it will swiftly stop taking all illicit opiates. For others, it simply reduces the amount of &ldquo;gear&rdquo; they need. Even in those latter cases, though, methadone still reduces the risk of death, of infection and of crime associated with drug use. It has appeared on the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s list of essential medicines since 2005. Yet it may still be one of the most stigmatised medications on the planet. In 2022, there were just 87 countries in the world with at least one programme offering opiate substitution therapy.</p> <h2>In need of a breakthrough</h2> <p>Here in the UK, we have a comprehensive methadone programme. Other substitution therapies are also available, including buprenorphine in various forms. But the vast majority of services now sit outside of the NHS and are provided by third sector organisations in a competitive commissioning model. And while we follow the science on some harm-reduction approaches, we reject others. There is no widespread availability of heroin-assisted treatment, despite the excellent evidence base for this approach. In fact, it was once the basis of the &ldquo;British System&rdquo;, in which heroin was prescribed by doctors up until the 1960s.</p> <p>In some cases, we simply take our time to follow the science. One of the great harm-reduction stories in recent years has been the incredible progress in making naloxone, the &ldquo;Lazarus drug&rdquo;, available to all. Naloxone has been around since the 1960s, but it was only at the turn of the century that pilot schemes in the UK showed its real promise. Given as an injection or a nasal spray it can reverse an opioid overdose, bringing blue breathless bodies back to gasping life. It is given out to people who use drugs to use on each other and to families to save loved ones. In some parts of the UK, the police are now carrying it as well.</p> <p>The harm-reduction philosophy can also be applied to party drugs. Education campaigns on how to safely take drugs like ecstasy or ketamine all fall under the umbrella. A crucial problem with all forms of illicit drug is the lack of standardisation. Dodgy pill factories churning out tablets in makeshift facilities don&rsquo;t have stringent quality control. Charities such as The Loop attend festivals and other events where they check drugs. Festival-goers voluntarily provide samples of the products, such as ecstasy, that they have bought. The Loop then does a chemical analysis of the drug. Warnings can then be issued for dodgy or particularly high-strength batches. In a recent case, chloroquine (best known as an antimalarial drug, very toxic in overdose) was being sold as ketamine.</p> <p>Harm reduction also has a role in legal drugs: &ldquo;no-lo&rdquo; alcohol drinks that reduce overall alcohol intakes fall into harm-reduction policies, as do e-cigarettes. There is still much to learn about vaping from a health perspective, but the current evidence suggests it is less harmful than smoking tobacco by an order of magnitude. The use of condoms is the prime example of where a harm-reduction intervention trumps an irrational and unrealistic insistence on abstinence.</p> <p>Arguably, the biggest harm-reduction intervention would be to decriminalise or to legalise drugs. In a stroke, this would sweep away many of the associated harms. This is, perhaps, the reason why many are opposed to harm reduction, seeing it as decriminalisation by the backdoor. Yet, while many activists advocating for harm-reduction measures may well support decriminalisation policies, the quotidian work of reducing harm is well established, as this piece has described.</p> <p>In some ways, the UK is a success story when it comes to harm reduction. We should recognise and celebrate that we have one of the lowest burdens in the world of HIV infection amongst people who inject drugs. But progress has stalled, even as the death toll from drug use continues to rise.</p> <p>Lessons can be learned from the 1980s, when harm-reduction values were embedded in our current system. That period is an example of what philosopher William MacAskill calls a &ldquo;malleable&rdquo; moment from the past, where a certain plasticity in people&rsquo;s thinking and a willingness to consider a different approach yielded significant results. Activists, healthcare and public health professionals came together with a government that didn&rsquo;t get bogged down in ideological or intellectual cul-de-sacs. It was harm reduction writ large. Since then, some of our thinking has ossified again, but we know that breakthroughs are possible.</p> <p>The UK needs a breakthrough when it comes to drug consumption rooms. The evidence is compelling, the moral imperative in the face of so many deaths irresistible. That&rsquo;s surely why Krykant acted &ndash; his was a practical and compassionate response. Providing a safe place, with access to clean needles and drugs, is an act of simple humanity, offering one of the most stigmatised groups in society some dignity. Professionals and peers can help anyone who &ldquo;goes over&rdquo; and overdoses. They can help reduce drug deaths and the transmission of disease. There is also evidence that drug consumption rooms benefit the wider community, reducing ambulance call-outs and drug litter on the streets. The UK was once a leader in harm reduction. Today, we need to re-model our approach once again, to better our society and reflect the needs of people whose lives depend upon it.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Capture.jpg" height="531" alt="The cover of Cocoon" width="343"></strong></p> <p><strong>Cocoon</strong> (World Editions) by Zhang Yueran, translated by Jeremy Tiang</p> <p>Zhang Yueran is one of China&rsquo;s &ldquo;post-80s&rdquo; writers, also known as the Y generation. Born in 1982 in Jinan, Shandong, in the wake of the Cultural Revolution and the one-child policy, she grew up in the Reform era. This epic novel (which took Zhang seven years to complete) is a stunning evocation of China&rsquo;s recent past and a poignant examination of how events reverberate through the decades.</p> <p>Former friends Li Jiaqi and Cheng Gong meet in their childhood home on the campus of Jinan&rsquo;s medical university. Jiaqi&rsquo;s grandfather, &ldquo;the most famous heart surgeon in China&rdquo;, is dying of lung cancer and she has returned to care for him in his final days. Zhang uses startling imagery in her opening pages to illustrate her protagonist&rsquo;s alienation: &ldquo;I stood by his bed, feeling death hover like a flock of bats.&rdquo;</p> <p>The pair have not met for 18 years and attempt to lay to rest the ghosts that still haunt them. In the course of their conversation, they revisit the family secrets that helped destroy their own hopes and dreams. Their narratives are given equal weight in separate chapters, although Jiaqi&rsquo;s is the more memorable. As they drink through the night and share their stories, old wounds are reopened and emotional scars retraced.</p> <p>Zhang is interested in the psychological fallout of China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution on her generation. Both her characters are neglected by their fathers, who, Zhang suggests, are victims of the harsh times in which they grew up. Their parents&rsquo; disillusionment initially unites the friends but, later, it rips them apart. Zhang writes perceptively about Jiaqi&rsquo;s relationship with her father: her desire to be loved by him; his coldness towards her; her subsequent inability to form lasting attachments. The passages describing his indifference towards his young daughter are heartbreaking.</p> <p>Jiaqi and Gong are surrounded by the vestiges of state oppression, vividly conveyed by their childhood playground &ndash; Dead Man&rsquo;s Tower. Originally constructed as a water tower when the Germans inhabited Jinan, it became the gruesome home for the cadavers and spare organs used in the university&rsquo;s dissection classes and experiments. It&rsquo;s a sinister wasteland, the soil permeated with formaldehyde. Jiaqi swiftly recognises its importance: that &ldquo;anyone who came here would be afraid to commit any crimes, especially capital ones... it wasn&rsquo;t easy to squander your life and not leave behind anything of value&mdash;they could always come and gouge it out of your remains.&rdquo;</p> <p>The central act of violence that drives the narrative takes place in 1967. As hospital manager, Gong&rsquo;s grandfather is denounced by rebels in a &ldquo;struggle session&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s beaten up and left unconscious in the Dead Man&rsquo;s Tower, a brutal attack from which he never fully recovers. Later, the family discover that someone had inserted &ldquo;a two-inch iron nail in his cranial cavity that must have entered through his temple, leaving a scar so small no one had paid it any attention&rdquo;. The nail had rusted, spreading infection through his brain tissue and leaving him in a vegetative state.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s the children&rsquo;s desire to know who committed the crime that leads to their own fracture. As Jiaqi observes: &ldquo;Secrets become secrets and get hidden away because they have the capacity for destruction... It&rsquo;s hard to say what it was that suppressed our childhood creativity, but we couldn&rsquo;t create, only destroy. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because in this country, destruction is always seen as the highest form of creation.&rdquo;</p> <p>Zhang believes &ldquo;the point of literature is to bring us to a deeper level of existence, so we can experience something we never have before.&rdquo; She manages to do just that in this remarkably astute novel, superbly translated by Jeremy Tiang. Her compelling narrative never lets up as she weaves together threads of memory which the reader has to unpick to reveal the truth. Cocoon is a powerful and stark account of intergenerational trauma.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Netradipa Patil has helped create a network of women who are fighting back against widowhood traditions" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/IMG_5358.jpg" height="1447" alt="Netradipa Patil smiles and looks into the camera, her arms folded, wearing a pink and gold sari" width="1448"></p> <p>For years, community healthcare worker Netradipa Patil had been making her rounds in rural Shirol, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. She enquired into people&rsquo;s health and asked how she could be of assistance. One day, she decided to ask an extra question: &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; She noticed that several women didn&rsquo;t even reply. Patil was haunted by their blank stares and silence. What made them feel so low? When she returned soon after, she encouraged these women to speak and spent hours listening to their stories. She discovered they were widows who had been harshly ostracised by their communities.</p> <p>There are more than 55 million widows living in India today. While dealing with the grief and financial loss often caused by losing their husbands, many of these women are pressured into conforming to traditions that have been described as &ldquo;social death&rdquo;. Excluded from festivals and celebrations, many are expected to stay in their homes for a year or longer after the death. These restrictions are accompanied by stigma. In some remote villages, widows are expelled from the community and sent to shelter homes.</p> <p>&ldquo;None of these rituals make any sense,&rdquo; says Patil. But in several parts of India, a woman&rsquo;s identity is still tied to that of her husband. &ldquo;This tradition goes back several centuries and the reason it&rsquo;s followed even today is to curb women&rsquo;s freedom and put restrictions on them.&rdquo; If a widow fails to follow these rituals, she is shamed. People may even accuse her of never having loved her husband.</p> <p>Patil was familiar with these customs, but still she was shocked by the women&rsquo;s stories. &ldquo;It left me numb,&rdquo; she says. One woman was a fellow healthcare worker, Lalita Mudshinge. She was in her early 30s when her husband, a tractor driver, died of a heart attack in 2017. Immediately, she was asked to break her bangles, remove the necklace and vermillion mark associated with married women, and refrain from wearing colourful clothes. Furthermore, she was forbidden from participating in weddings, child naming ceremonies and other celebrations.</p> <p>Mudshinge was prepared for this ostracisation. She also anticipated being blamed for her husband&rsquo;s death, as many widows are. &ldquo;I kept all the medical records safely and even the autopsy report,&rdquo; she says. But despite the evidence that he had died of cardiac arrest, she was still accused by her in-laws and members of the community of playing a part. They also wanted to force her to stay in the house for a year. This was not possible, as Mudshinge, like Patil, worked as a community healthcare worker, which meant regular trips into the centre of the village.</p> <p>&ldquo;The men from the village would stalk me in the streets and make bad comments,&rdquo; she said. The abuse reached a stage where even stepping out of her front door began to feel dangerous. &ldquo;I was so stressed and scared that I often fell ill,&rdquo; she says. The social stigma directly impacted her work, with senior staff yelling at her constantly. &ldquo;Mudshinge was suicidal, depressed, and on the verge of leaving her job,&rdquo; Patil says. However, within a few years, she was helping her fellow widows and battling patriarchal attitudes in her country. How did it happen?</p> <h2>The fight back begins</h2> <p>It all started with that extra question, &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; This simple invitation to speak progressed into hours of conversation, as Mudshinge was finally able to explain her plight. Patil gave Mudshinge her contact details and said to reach out at any time. She also started visiting the woman&rsquo;s home and tried to persuade her in-laws to stop practising the widowhood rituals.</p> <p>Initially, they were not convinced. So, Patil increased the visits. After a few months, Mudshinge began noticing a change. Her in-laws were more accepting of her leaving the house, and even allowed her to wear jewellery and colourful clothes. Men from the community continued to harass her when she did her rounds as a healthcare worker, but after Patil began accompanying her, she found she was more able to face them down.</p> <p>Patil was helping five other widows at the time. They were all coping with challenges, and she felt they were not being adequately supported. So she reached out to a fellow healthcare worker in a nearby village. Together, they began to organise awareness sessions for widows.</p> <p>These healthcare workers understand the plight of widows because they are all women and come from rural communities themselves. They are Accredited Social Health Activists, or ASHA workers. There are over a million ASHAs in India: roughly one for every 1,000 people. They are all female and come from the communities they serve. They do everything from prenatal care to administering vaccines, providing medicines for common ailments and maintaining health records for every community member. <br>Patil started to team up with more ASHA workers, reasoning that widowhood was a serious public health matter and should be treated as such. At first, nobody came to the awareness sessions. They had to squeeze in talking to the widows during routine community visits. Finally, after around six months of this work, with remote counselling done by phone, a few women started showing up to the sessions. &ldquo;It was so powerful,&rdquo; Mudshinge says. &ldquo;It helped me muster the courage to face the stigma.&rdquo;</p> <p>There was still a long way to go, however, when it came to acceptance from the community. That&rsquo;s when Patil came up with a unique idea. She invited all the widows from the nearby villages and asked a local government official to join them for a special event. Patil asked the official to celebrate the widows for their heroism in battling the oppressive widowhood rituals. The official agreed. It was a bold move. News spread in the villages and beyond, and the event was covered by the regional media.</p> <p>Mudshinge printed the photos and kept them in her wallet. &ldquo;From then on, whenever someone abused me, I showed them these photos, and it helped me,&rdquo; she said. She would never have guessed that a photo could change her life. The event expanded into a series, hosted by several villages in Maharashtra. At each event, widows were celebrated and encouraged to break with the rituals and practices that had brought so much suffering into their lives.</p> <p>Around the same time, social activist Pramod Zinjade started a movement asking village heads in Maharashtra to pass a resolution to ban the widowhood rituals outright. In May last year, Herwad became the first village to do so. The state government asked all villages to follow suit, and reportedly 7,500 villages have passed resolutions seeking to curb the practices. However, there are no legal ramifications if these resolutions are not followed through, so it&rsquo;s difficult to say how effective they will be.</p> <h2>Just the beginning</h2> <p>Changing local and state policy is important. But the work doesn&rsquo;t end there. As lawyer and activist Amol Naik says, &ldquo;Implementation is the key.&rdquo; Naik has spent over a decade fighting to protect and uphold the rights of women farmers and agricultural labourers, many of whom suffer greatly if they are faced with widowhood. He points out that widows do have legal rights under Indian law &ndash; such as the right to inherit their husband&rsquo;s property &ndash; but often feel unable to assert these rights. &ldquo;Younger widows are ostracised and made to feel that their relatives are doing them a favour by letting them stay [in their own homes]. Eventually, they stop asking.&rdquo;</p> <p>Akkatai Teli is an activist who has spent four decades working with widows and bringing the perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence to justice. She says that many widows aren&rsquo;t aware of their legal rights and there can often be a vested interest in not telling them. &ldquo;Most of them are denied a share in the property and kicked out of the house because the in-laws fear they will ascertain their rights,&rdquo; she says. Many of these women end up in shelter homes. The problem is so severe that in 2018, the government built a shelter home in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, that can accommodate 1,000 widows.</p> <p>Patil, meanwhile, has continued to work on the root cause of widows&rsquo; problems. Between 2017 and 2022 she trained a team of 20 women, most of whom are widows themselves, to help combat regressive customs. So far, the network has helped hundreds of widows from over 20 villages in Maharashtra. Her attempts are now being formalised into a full-time support system at the village, district and state levels.</p> <p>Patil&rsquo;s goal is not just to help these women heal, but to ensure they can live a life of dignity. This involves practical support; ensuring the widows have the correct paperwork to access government welfare, training them to become self-reliant and helping them start their own businesses. She also helps them access mental health treatment. &ldquo;Telling their stories can be triggering for the women,&rdquo; she says, so they have learned to be careful in their work.</p> <p>But there is another challenge. As an ASHA, Patil isn&rsquo;t paid for her work with the widows, nor is she trained to provide counselling. &ldquo;The health department doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge our work,&rdquo; she says. The work with widows is classed as voluntary. She says that ASHAs aren&rsquo;t paid enough in any case, and could achieve much more with adequate compensation.</p> <p>While the exact figures vary across states, they are uniformly low. In Maharashtra, ASHAs earn an average of 3,500-5,000 Indian Rupees (&pound;34-50) per month. They are paid per task &ndash; for example, for providing antenatal or postnatal care and overseeing a pregnancy in a public hospital, they earn &pound;4.90. &ldquo;ASHAs are a support system for millions of people,&rdquo; Patil points out. &ldquo;If the government starts paying us adequately and on time, many [more] ASHAs can help women recover from their trauma.&rdquo;</p> <h2>A turning point</h2> <p>Ongoing support is important, as even if the lives of widows improve, they still have to recover from the abuse and ostracisation. When Anjali Pehelwan, 39, lost her husband to Covid, her relatives weren&rsquo;t concerned about her grief. &ldquo;All they wanted was to forcefully take away my jewellery and toe rings,&rdquo; she remembers. Although Pehelwan resisted, a few women pulled off her jewellery, bruising and cutting her. The cuts healed in a week, she says, but it took a year before she recovered from the mental trauma.</p> <p>Luckily, Pehelwan was able to access support. She was put in touch with Maya Patil, the ASHA worker who had helped Netradipa organise the very first awareness sessions for widows. (Netradipa and Maya share a last name but are not related.) Maya Patil started counselling Pehelwan on the phone and in person. Gradually, Pehelwan started wearing her jewellery again, began to leave the house, and started asking people to treat her as an equal to other women. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. &ldquo;The community members were so aghast that they started calling me ill-omened and a witch,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>Then, in April 2022, Maya Patil came up with the idea of celebrating Gudi Padwa (Maharashtra&rsquo;s new year), considered to be the most auspicious occasion in the Hindu calendar. &ldquo;Traditionally, while a widow is allowed to celebrate this occasion, they are barred from performing any rituals,&rdquo; Pehelwan explains. Maya Patil was determined to change this. She called a group of 20 women together, including Pehelwan and another widow. &ldquo;I started talking about the discriminatory practices and why we should raise our voice,&rdquo; she says. At first, the other women stepped away from the widows, but Patil wouldn&rsquo;t give up. She convinced them to celebrate the new year festival together, with Pehelwan taking the lead.</p> <p>There was a backlash from certain members of the community. People spread a rumour that Pehelwan was celebrating the festival because she had remarried. (Widows in India are allowed to remarry, but in reality they are often ostracised if they do.) A scandal was brewing, but fortunately the local journalists reported the event accurately, confirming that Pehelwan was still single. &ldquo;That was the best time to shut down all such conspiracy theories,&rdquo; she recalls, laughing at the memory.</p> <p>Later, Pehelwan discovered that there were 450 widows and separated women in her village of Arjunwad alone. &ldquo;We need to stop using the word &lsquo;widow&rsquo; and come up with better words,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;&lsquo;Widow&rsquo; is never a woman&rsquo;s identity. It&rsquo;s no fault of hers that her husband has died.&rdquo; She found that many women wanted to oppose the rituals, but didn&rsquo;t speak up because of the patriarchal system. &ldquo;My goal is to help them voice their concerns.&rdquo;</p> <p>Pehelwan works long hours as a data entry operator. But although her work is tiring, she spends her evenings taking phone calls from other widows, encouraging them to leave the house and assert their rights. &ldquo;People think it&rsquo;s a burden, but it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Whenever I see a woman healing, I feel I have given someone a new life. While this can never make up for my loss, I am proud to help bring an end to the trauma of other women.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>
