<p class="lead">We&#8217;re winding down to the last week of our winter break, and Mary and I took off to the Big City for a few days. We had no grand plans, just a break from the routine, where we&#8217;d hang out in a hotel and do some exploring. Unfortunately, we got there immediately after a major storm dumped a dense layer of wet snow on the city. We arrived as the snow plows were clearing out places where we could park &#8212; and they weren&#8217;t done by the time we would leave. That cramped our style, since walking around the city was slogging through nearly impassable piles of thick soggy stuff. Our grand adventure was reduced to short walks to nice restaurants.</p>
<p>We also met up with <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/stderr/">Marcus Ranum</a>, who was in Minneapolis to help a friend move. He drove a truck from Pennsylvania to Minnesota during a snowstorm! I want a friend like that, who&#8217;d drop what he was doing to drive 800 miles to help me move. We got a pleasant eveing out of it, at least.</p>
<p>Yesterday was spent driving back and taking naps. Now I have no excuse, I have to start assembling a syllabus and getting organized for genetics.</p>

<p class="lead">Yesterday, we traveled to Minneapolis. It was the day after a big snowstorm, and the only thing worse would be if we arrived a day earlier. Sidewalks haven&#8217;t been cleared, roads are covered with slush, and we <em>tried</em> walking around town. It wasn&#8217;t fun. Two foot tall piles of snow on the path made it more of a mountain climbing adventure.</p>
<p>One positive, though: I&#8217;m still suffering with this nasty deep-seated cold, erupting occasionally into hoarse coughing and snotty horrible sneezes. I found a cure! It&#8217;s only temporary, though, but it is good for a few hours relief. We went to an Indian restaurant and I ordered a vindaloo with a couple of volcanoes worth of hotness. It worked! My sinuses were thoroughly cleared out, I could breath unimpeded, and my throat was quivering in terror &#8212; if it coughed one more time, I was going to order  another raund.</p>
<p>I am sorry to report, though, that around 2am the slime had oozed back and repopulated every cranial cavity. I may have to do it again.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><em><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/IMG_74751.jpeg" height="959" alt="Carrie Jenkins" width="1596"><br></em></p> <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><em>Carrie Jenkins is a philosopher, novelist and poet, working at the intersection of academic philosophy and the creative arts. She is a professor of philosophy at the University of British Columbia and led the Metaphysics of Love Project (2014 to 2019). Her latest book is "Sad Love: Romance and the search for meaning" (Polity).</em></p> <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><strong>You have written that "we have a collective responsibility to figure out romantic love&rdquo;. Why is this important?</strong></p> <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">We make so many life-changing decisions based on whether we&rsquo;re in love &ndash; decisions like whether to move across the world, get married, or have children &ndash; and yet when it comes to <em>what</em> exactly we&rsquo;re basing those decisions on, we&rsquo;re often all too comfortable saying it&rsquo;s a mysterious magical force that nobody can understand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know when you know,&rdquo; people say, and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t overthink it.&rdquo; But this means a huge factor shaping not only our personal lives but the very fabric of society is left unexamined, and whatever harms it may be causing go unchallenged.</p> <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><strong>Love is such a popular topic, and so central to our lives, that it might seem bizarre that we still have to "figure it out&rdquo;. But you&rsquo;ve argued that the cloud of mystery around love might be purposeful?</strong></p> <p>Yes! I call this the &ldquo;romantic mystique&rdquo; &ndash; the idea that we cannot understand love and shouldn&rsquo;t even try. My question is <em>who does that benefit</em>? And my answer is: the people benefiting the most from the status quo continuing as it is. So we have to think about what status quo is created and sustained by our current baseline understanding of love being the way it is. We think of romantic love as (ideally) monogamous, permanent, and leading to the formation of new nuclear family units. So anyone who benefits from a society structured in this way benefits from the romantic mystique.</p> <p>To cut a long story short, the romantic mystique is a force for social conservatism: it benefits the patriarchal, white supremacist, colonial, capitalist status quo. It does this by channelling love &ndash; a powerful and potentially disruptive force that can lead us to form intense co-operative bonds with one another &ndash; into a single structure that is easy to control. There&rsquo;s a reason Margaret Thatcher once said she believed in individuals and families, but not society. Under capitalism, the nuclear family is essentially just a larger consuming unit. Whereas extended community bonds, and any form of love that may direct our focus beyond our picket fences, is risky. That kind of thing can lead to solidarity, collective action and political change.</p> <p class="MsoListParagraph"><strong>What were the aims of the Metaphysics of Love project and why was it important to pair philosophers with poets?</strong></p> <p>I had a frustration with the way philosophical discussions of love were proceeding, at least within the academic discipline of philosophy. It wasn&rsquo;t that those discussions weren&rsquo;t fruitful and interesting in their own right, more that they felt limited. I only saw a few topics being addressed, and a relatively uniform perspective on life represented in the conversations. My questions and my perspective weren&rsquo;t there, and the more I talked about it with others the more convinced I became that I wasn&rsquo;t the only one feeling that way.</p> <p>I turned to interdisciplinary work partly in an attempt to break out of the mould: poetry struck me a natural source for the kind of insight and creative power that shakes things up. Poets are used to working at the edge of what can be said, or even beyond it. On the flip side, philosophy offers a massively powerful toolkit for digging into the theoretical and speculative aspects of those questions. So (despite what Plato said) I see a natural kinship between philosophy and poetry.</p> <p>These days, I draw on many different disciplines in my work. I now think of the approach not as interdisciplinary but as <em>undisciplined</em>. I&rsquo;m not trying to straddle separate disciplines, but to challenge the very idea of separation.</p> <p class="MsoListParagraph"><strong>You've written about the &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo; myth, but isn&rsquo;t its power fading with every generation, as more people decide to remain unmarried and divorce rates rise?</strong></p> <p>Sadly, no! The myth is becoming more and more obviously unrealistic, but even as that happens its power may actually be increasing. That&rsquo;s because the way the myth functions is as an <em>ideal</em>, a standard against which we measure ourselves and find ourselves wanting. It&rsquo;s unrealistic, but in the same way that beauty standards are: we are all meant to fall short to some degree, and then feel bad about it, and then to go out and buy something to feel (temporarily) better. My work isn&rsquo;t aimed at showing the myth is unrealistic &ndash; we know that already. It&rsquo;s aimed at unmasking the myth as a <em>bad ideal to aim at in the first place</em>.</p> <p class="MsoListParagraph"><strong>Can you tell us about your theory of how love functions both as a social construct and a biological phenomenon?</strong></p> <p>Well, we have this ancient, evolved, biological machinery in our brains and bodies that accounts for many of our experiences of romance &ndash; from the nervous adrenaline rushes, to the dopamine hits when our interest is reciprocated, to the surges of oxytocin that accompany a secure bond. But then we also have a socially constructed <em>script</em> for a romantic relationship, where it&rsquo;s supposed to proceed from an initial crush to a dating stage to sex then monogamous marriage and then kids. That&rsquo;s the romantic &ldquo;happy ever after&rdquo; script.</p> <p>My question is: how do these two things &mdash;the biology and the social script &ndash; fit together? And the analogy I like to use for this is an actor playing a role. A biological organism &ndash; such as William Shatner &ndash; can be cast in the scripted role of Captain Kirk on <em>Star Trek</em>. In the same way, we can &ldquo;cast&rdquo; the biological machinery of love in the role of modern romance. The interesting philosophical work, for me, is about how good that casting decision is. William Shatner does a good job as Captain Kirk. But how well does our biological love machinery fit the contemporary script for a romantic relationship? For some of us, it seems to work well (or at least, well enough). But for many of us &ndash; most obviously for all the polyamorous people and the aromantic people [people with little or no romantic attraction to others] &ndash; it&rsquo;s a poor fit.</p> <p>The problem isn&rsquo;t the scripted role as such, but the idea that it&rsquo;s a <em>one-size-fits-all</em>. I argue for more conscious customisation and tailoring in our relationships. The more we do that kind of thing, the weaker the normative model becomes. That model can change, as many of us have seen in our lifetimes with the gradual moves towards the normalisation of same-sex romance. (When I was a teenager, the script stated <em>very firmly</em> that romance was between a man and a woman. In that order.) The normativity of the romantic script &ndash; and the policing of every &ldquo;deviation&rdquo; from it &ndash; thrives in the darkness of the romantic mystique. The remedy is sunlight: more explicit discussion and open challenge.</p> <p class="MsoListParagraph"><strong>What is the Romantic Paradox?</strong></p> <p>This idea is based on an older idea, known as the Paradox of Happiness, which says that the pursuit of happiness is self-defeating. Philosopher J.S. Mill put it this way: &ldquo;Those only are happy &hellip; who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness &hellip; Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way.&rdquo; I also like Viktor Frankl&rsquo;s catchy statement that happiness &ldquo;cannot be pursued; it must ensue.&rdquo;</p> <p>My Romantic Paradox says that the same goes for the romantic &ldquo;happy ever after.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re all inundated, from early childhood onwards, with the idea that we should pursue this as a (or even <em>the</em>) central component of a good life.</p> <p>But chasing after the romantic &ldquo;happy after ever&rdquo; is actually a way to end up frustrated and miserable. This can be considered a special case of the Paradox of Happiness, but the situation is exacerbated here by two factors. First, the expectations we put on romance: the higher the stakes, the greater the devastation when we &ldquo;fail.&rdquo; And second, the script for romance emphasises things like being a perfect fit for one&rsquo;s soulmate and nothing ever changing, which make it less likely that we&rsquo;ll be able to successfully navigate challenges and changes in a healthy way.</p> <p class="MsoListParagraph"><strong>Your latest book, &ldquo;Sad Love&rdquo;, is a powerful case for embracing eudaimonic love, reflecting on its original Aristotelian meaning of &ldquo;having a good guardian spirit.&rdquo; How can we apply this to our lives today?</strong></p> <p>The old meaning of &ldquo;eudaimonic&rdquo; &ndash; even older than Aristotle &ndash; comes from the roots &ldquo;eu&rdquo; (good) and &ldquo;daimon&rdquo; (spirit). I think of eudaimonia in a contemporary setting as being about good spirits in every sense. You don&rsquo;t have to think of this as anything supernatural; it&rsquo;s more like what&rsquo;s going on when people call their &ldquo;fairy godmothers&rdquo; or talk about the &ldquo;vibe&rdquo; in a room.</p> <p>There are all kinds of <em>bad</em> daimons that can ruin our love lives, from the smallest scale &ndash; like the little voices in our heads that tell us we aren&rsquo;t good enough &ndash; to the global &ndash; like racism or homophobia. Good or bad daimons are operative at every scale in between, too: even in a globally white supremacist world, a supportive family or local community can give an interracial relationship a much better chance of thriving. When we think about romantic love, we are inclined to think of it as a private or personal thing.</p> <p>But I want to challenge this idea. Lovers are never operating in isolation, even when they build picket fences or close the bedroom door. I aim to call attention to how deeply love is affected by our interconnectedness, and depends for its very existence on supportive daimons at every scale from the tiny to the global.</p> <p class="MsoListParagraph"><strong>Eudaimonic love, you write, means abandoning mythology and taking on responsibility for crafting our relationships. Is this why you&rsquo;ve said that existentialism is due for a come-back?</strong></p> <p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a big part of it. Existentialism is all about the ways we create ourselves as individuals through our choices and our actions. So I&rsquo;m saying that, in taking more responsibility for crafting and customising our relationships, we can move away from what existentialists would call &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; &ndash; the attempted abdication of responsibility in favour of a script. We never <em>truly</em> ditch our responsibilities &ndash; after all, it&rsquo;s we who chose to follow the script. But we can pretend to ourselves that we have no choice but to follow society&rsquo;s script for (say) how a husband or a boyfriend is supposed to behave. That&rsquo;s bad faith, and I want us all to come to a better sense of how much responsibility we really have for our own love lives, and for the evolution of the social scripts and norms.</p> <p><em>Carrie Jenkin's "Sad Love: Romance and the search for meaning" is published by Polity. </em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/the-newlyweds-9781982134440_hr.jpeg" height="710" alt="The Newlyweds by Mansi Choksi" width="478"><br></strong></span></p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>The Newlyweds (Icon) b</strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>y Mansi Choksi </strong></span></p> <p class="p6">At first, reading <em>The Newlyweds</em>, I was unsure as to the genre of the book &ndash; testament, I would argue, to Mansi Choksi&rsquo;s novelistic skills. It is a work of non-fiction, but written with such literary flair that you wonder whether the photos of the protagonists are a double bluff and it really is a novel after all.</p> <p class="p7">The book is promoted as a portrait of &ldquo;love in the New India&rdquo;, but many of the modern relationships are still doomed because they break centuries-old taboos on intermarriage between religions or castes and same-sex relationships. What is new is how Modi and his vigilante Hindu gangs weaponise intermarriage between Hindu women and Muslim men by framing it as &ldquo;love jihad&rdquo; &ndash; a disturbing twist on an old prejudice which gives ultra-nationalist activists the excuse to terrorise couples and their families today.</p> <p class="p7">Also specific to the New India is the existence of an &ldquo;NGO&rdquo; called the Love Commandos, whose mission is to help young lovers thwarted by authoritarian parents, caste, community or religion to come together and be married. Sanjoy Sachdev, founder of the organisation, points to the first intercaste marriage between two Hindu gods, Shiva and Parvati, to give his mission a religious blessing, so that young lovers can &ldquo;inherit a country where love is not a crime&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p7">The story of the NGO has a darkly comic twist. Sachdev, we learn, has himself never been in love, although he has had four children in an arranged marriage to a woman whose destiny it is to look after his ageing father while he gads about rescuing lovesick couples. This idealistic project is undercut with corruption. Sachdev bleeds the couples dry under one pretext or another, and once he has got his claws into those who have access to money, they are unable to escape his &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; easily.</p> <p class="p7">The main focus of <em>The Newlyweds</em> is on three sets of couples &ndash; although other cases, including a brutal &ldquo;honour&rdquo; killing, also get a mention. Dhawinder and Neetu are from the same village, but one is a Sikh and one a Hindu; Monika and Arif are in a Hindu-Muslim relationship; and Preethi and Reshma are a lesbian couple. One of the most poignant moments in the book is when Reshma learns the word &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo;. She decides, unaware of the word&rsquo;s long abusive history, that English is a great language because it contains a special word to describe her relationship with Preethi.</p> <p class="p7">In the two main heterosexual relationships outlined in the book, the women&rsquo;s parents and community wreak revenge on the men&rsquo;s families, hounding them out of their homes and livelihoods. It would be interesting to know whether this is a common pattern; if so, it underlines the view that women are receptacles of the community&rsquo;s honour and all hell must be let loose on men who sully that.</p> <p class="p7">I have minor quibbles about the writing. There are some wonderful lines, like &ldquo;Men with small smiles and big misconceptions about their place in the world barged into the lives of happy couples,&rdquo; but these are mixed with exchanges that can feel a little on-the-nose. It is also crudely tilted towards an American audience &ndash; the writer, or perhaps her editor, failing to recognise the cultural interconnectedness of the modern world with lines like &ldquo;hastily sliding vegetable-filled pastries called samosas into a pan of whistling oil&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p7">Given the huge societal and emotional obstacles that the couples have to overcome to find happiness together, there is a deep poignancy when the relationships begin to unravel, sometimes as a result of economic and social pressures and sometimes due to incompatibility.</p> <p class="p7">The author&rsquo;s stated quest is to discover &ldquo;if love can endure with dignity if it becomes tainted with shame&rdquo;. The stories move from the societal restrictions placed on love in India to a more universal, introspective, almost unanswerable question that all the couples face to varying degrees: &ldquo;Was it worth it?&rdquo;</p> <p class="p7"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Far more than just a nonfiction book about how space works, the &ldquo;autobiography&rdquo; is a narrative with a true character arc, for something so removed from human life that you might never have thought to anthropomorphise it in the first place. The Milky Way&rsquo;s voice is unique and compelling, able to draw in any reader, whether or not they have prior interest in astronomy.</p> <p class="p4">So, if a celestial body as mind-bogglingly expansive as the Milky Way actually talked to us, what would it say? In McTier&rsquo;s world, it&rsquo;s a snarky, self-righteous God-like figure. This is its opening line: &ldquo;Take a look around you human. What do you see? Actually, don&rsquo;t answer that. Why would I bother listening to you when I know you&rsquo;ll get it wrong?&rdquo; Soon after, it calls the reader a &ldquo;vain, filthy animal&rdquo; and our entire species &ldquo;simple creatures&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p4">In the first few chapters, I longed for McTier&rsquo;s soothing voice from the preface. The Milky Way was grating, condescending and unrelatable, constantly reminding us that we wouldn&rsquo;t exist without it. At the same time, however, I wondered if the reader would take the Milky Way seriously if it spoke and thought like a human. Our galaxy is currently a spry 13.6 billion years old. It seems natural that it might suffer from an extreme case of the Overview Effect, where <br>astronauts who see Earth from above reconsider our small planet&rsquo;s place in the Universe.</p> <p class="p4">While the Milky Way&rsquo;s lifetime is long, McTier tells its story in a quick-to-read 200-something pages, jam-packed with science. The Milky Way character leads us through the Big Bang and its own birth, giving us a detailed account of how galaxies are made, and also how astronomers have figured all this out. This is one of my favourite aspects of the book. The Milky Way often describes how humans came to know the stories it&rsquo;s telling, and the part played by our toolkit of telescopes, from Gaia to Kepler and beyond. As an astronomer myself, I often wish that people knew more of what we astronomers actually do.</p> <p class="p4">The &ldquo;autobiography&rdquo; goes on to tell us about our cosmic neighbourhood, known as the Local Group, introducing us to three nearby galactic pals: Larry (the Large Magellanic Cloud), Sammy (the Small Magellanic Cloud) and Trin (the Triangulum Galaxy). The Local Group has a vast zoo of different types of galaxies, from gorgeous spirals like next door Andromeda to weird, blobby irregulars. But of course, our narrator is most concerned with itself, and its distinct &ldquo;body parts&rdquo;. A fascinating part of the Milky Way&rsquo;s body is the supermassive black hole at its centre. Pretty much every big galaxy has a black hole, one of the most mysterious objects in space &ndash; something so massive and dense that not even light, the fastest thing in the Universe, can escape its gravitational grip.</p> <p class="p4">Often in science writing, black holes are described as devouring monsters, or eldritch horrors. In McTier&rsquo;s book, the Milky Way&rsquo;s black hole (nicknamed &ldquo;Sarge&rdquo;, for its scientific name Sagittarius A*) is instead described as a feeling that might be familiar to many readers: the seemingly inescapable tug of depression or negative thoughts. Sarge keeps trying to drag the Milky Way down, but the Milky Way won&rsquo;t let it. For me, this felt like a turning point in my relationship with the character. The God-like galaxy reveals itself to be actually quite human, facing the challenges of what it means to be alive and feel despair.</p> <p class="p4">Much like humans, it also wonders about its own death, explaining &ldquo;what it really means for a galaxy &ndash; a massive, self-sustaining system with a disparate but coherent consciousness &ndash; to die.&rdquo; The death of the Milky Way is entangled with the end of the entirety of the Universe, a complicated cosmological affair. There are a few ways the Universe may meet its demise, and the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answer is still debated by scientists. But they all have one thing in common: it&rsquo;s extremely hard to explain the details of these scenarios in layman&rsquo;s terms. Yet McTier does a fantastic job, managing to explain quantum fields in a way that does not scare off the reader.</p> <p class="p4">The science communication is extremely well executed, but there is also much more to this book. McTier has a PhD in astrophysics, but she also has a Harvard degree in folklore. Interwoven with the fascinating information on astronomy, the Milky Way tells us about the names that different Earth cultures have given to it, the stories told about its constellations, and (my personal favourite) how sci-fi and other &ldquo;modern myths&rdquo; reveal truths in turn about humanity. &ldquo;Did you think myths were just things of the past?&rdquo; the Milky Way asks. &ldquo;Absolutely not. Humanity makes new myths every day about the things you want to have faith in . . . At their core, myths are stories that you capital B believe in, even if you know some (or all) of it to be false.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">Perhaps surprisingly, this cosmological &ldquo;autobiography&rdquo; is a deeply human book, exploring the intersections between myth and science while teaching the reader about our galaxy, the scientific process and more. We learn that the Milky Way does have a soft spot for humans, the weird and seemingly unique creatures that we are. And in the end, it even becomes a likeable pal: a friend watching over us from the skies, encouraging us to take care of each other and marvel in the discoveries our astronomers make. &ldquo;Ask questions about the world around you and find real answers to them,&rdquo; the galaxy instructs. &ldquo;Decide you deserve better and fight to clean your sky of all kinds of pollution &ndash; trust me, I&rsquo;m worth it.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p class="lead">Ever since the Trump administration, I&#8217;ve been standing in my shrine, chanting &#8220;<em>BLOOD AND SOULS FOR MY LORD ARIOCH</em>,&#8221; and leaving a chalice of blood on the altar, all in hopes of summoning the <a href="https://stormbringer.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos_Lords">chaos lords</a> to my aid. I may have miscalculated. I did not expect my ritual to be so effective.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-and-democrats-quietly-consider-a-kevin-mccarthy-speaker-deal?ref=home">Republican party has descended into shrieking madness</a>, unable to accomplish even the most basic tasks of governing. On the positive side, that may mean they&#8217;re going to be unable to implement the specifics of their evil agenda, but on the debit side, they&#8217;re also blocking one of the houses of congress from governing at all.</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe I should back off a bit on the ritual incantations, but Arioch does not treat weakness kindly, and the backlash against me, personally, would be unthinkable. I must continue. I will accept the blame if the house of representatives bursts into green flames, Lauren Boebert is elected speaker, and giant tentacled beasts manifest in the Potomac. But you knew this is where the Republicans were going all along, right?</p>

<p class="lead">For you non-academics unfamiliar with life at the university, yesterday was the day I got my evaluations. Yes, it&#8217;s true, the students get to turn everything around and grade the faculty on their performance. I can&#8217;t actually fail &#8212; tenure, you know &#8212; but these things do matter when it&#8217;s time to determine raises and that sort of thing (which will be roughly in mid-March). The department gets a tiny pot of money that the chair will dole out to the good little boys and girls, and she will use student evals as part of the determination, which also includes research and service.</p>
<p>So yesterday I cracked the virtual envelope to get the results, and they were fine. On a scale of 0 to 6, I got all 5s and 6s, which might translate into a raise of a few tens of dollars in a few months. It probably isn&#8217;t worth it, because I have to bust my ass for a year to get biology across to the students.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more interesting is the comments students write, which I take far more seriously than numbers punched into a Likert scale, and are far more likely to get me to change things in the course. I got a few criticisms that made me happy.</p>
<p>Students said, &#8220;wasted too much time on creationism&#8221; and &#8220;I want to learn more biology, not creationism.&#8221; For context, I give ONE(1) lecture out of 30 that addresses religious objections to evolutionary theory. One. And this audience of smart millennials is just completely over it. That makes me so happy.</p>
<p>OK, have it your way. I&#8217;m cutting that lecture out of next year&#8217;s curriculum, and replacing it with more straight-up unvarnished biology, with no regrets. I hope this class is representative of their generation, because it&#8217;s about time we could ignore that nonsense.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/escapelarge.jpeg" height="513" alt="'Escape' cover" width="319"><br></strong></span></p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Escape (Bonnier): </strong></span><strong><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">How a generation shaped, destroyed and survived the internet </span></strong><span class="s2">by Marie Le Conte </span></p> <p class="p5">There are, very broadly speaking, three generations of humankind alive right now who will never coexist again. There are people &ndash; such as this reviewer &ndash; of middle age and upwards, who reached adulthood without Googling anything, sending an email, having a social media account or owning a mobile phone. We are the last of our kind: people for whom the default setting was being out of touch. At the opposite end of the spectrum are people in their mid-20s and younger, for whom the online realm is as taken for granted as electric light.</p> <p class="p6">The journalist Marie Le Conte is of the generation between. She was born in 1991, and reckons she probably went online for the first time later that decade: a point at which the internet, as she notes, was still routinely capitalised as the Internet, much as baffled parents of earlier decades might have fretfully discussed Rock And Roll. New technologies are usually first adopted and appropriated by the young: Le Conte launched a blog when she was 12, and a website largely concerned with indie rock when she was 15. She was among the pathfinders who first used MSN Messenger, MySpace and Tumblr, and now presides over nearly 90,000 followers on Twitter. &ldquo;I was born and bred online,&rdquo; she writes in the introduction, &ldquo;and if you remove the life I have led on there, it leaves me with no life at all.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p6">This is a statement of fact, not a plea for sympathy. Le Conte is emphatic that her time online has largely been a tremendous hoot, and has the anecdotes to prove it. But in her telling of how the internet changed during that period, something of the indie rock website editor can be discerned. Le Conte&rsquo;s view of the internet now is similar to that of the early fan of a once obscure band that is now monstrously famous, who finds themselves jammed into some cavernous arena peevishly seething, &ldquo;Who are all these bloody people?&rdquo; (Le Conte, whose droll self-mockery is a strength of <em>Escape</em>, would probably not object to this characterisation.)</p> <p class="p6">Le Conte uses a mixture of interviews with others and personal reflections to chart the internet&rsquo;s trajectory from its Wild West period as a vast landscape of discrete communities, each with their own rules, conventions and traditions, to today&rsquo;s much more centralised arrangement where much if not most online activity is filtered through less than a handful of social media platforms. The villages have become a megalopolis. Just like city living offline, this has advantages: you frequently bump into people, ideas and opinions you would not normally have sought out. It also has disadvantages: exactly the same thing.</p> <p class="p6">Humanity has been living in three-dimensional big cities a good while now, and has by and large developed the key necessary quality: indifference. The deal is basically that our fellow citizens may say, do, believe, worship, wear, consume and love what they please so long as they don&rsquo;t bother us with it. Online, you may have noticed, it does not work like that: social media is plagued by people for whom being performatively angry in public, very often about total bullshit, has become a hobby, and/or a job.</p> <p class="p6">Le Conte takes issue, and persuasively so, with the conventional wisdom that social media has insulated us all in echo chambers. The actual difficulty, she suggests, is the opposite: &ldquo;There is a fundamental problem with how we live online, and it is that we are now all together, all of the time.&rdquo; Le Conte illustrates this via relating her own role in one of the inadvertent sitcoms often catalysed by social media: she posted a whimsical tweet about the mixed blessing of living within earshot of an opera singer, it was eventually retweeted into the timeline of another opera singer, and Le Conte duly found herself indignantly addressed by wrathful opera singers. The serious point: &ldquo;Our spaces make us feel tense because we never feel truly safe in them anymore.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p6"><em>Escape</em> is a smart and funny analysis of a very modern phenomenon, but it&rsquo;s also a tale as old as time: of us letting something get worse because it was easy, cheap and convenient to do so.</p> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Still from Nathan Fielder's comedy show " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/nathan-fielder_0.jpg" height="1064" alt="Still from Nathan Fielder's 'The Rehearsal'" width="1596"></p> <p class="p1">How best to explain <em>The Rehearsal</em>? Comedian Nathan Fielder&rsquo;s new HBO show doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to easy summary. The show begins with a simple conceit: Fielder helps everyday people prepare for big personal challenges by meticulously rehearsing them. But, when the situations become ever more complicated and the elaborate rehearsals spiral out of control, the show blurs the line between performance and reality. In one heartbreaking instance, a young child actor involved in a parenting &ldquo;rehearsal&rdquo; seems unable to recognise that Fielder isn&rsquo;t his real father.</p> <p class="p3"><em>The Rehearsal</em> is emblematic of a perceptible change in modern comedy. We are increasingly fascinated with the comedy of real life; authentic portrayals of the messy business of being alive.</p> <p class="p3">Fielder is a Canadian comedian with an exaggeratedly awkward, monotonous delivery, whose reputation before <em>The Rehearsal </em>was founded on the four seasons of his superlative Comedy Central show <em>Nathan For You</em>, in which he &ldquo;helps&rdquo; American business owners. His solutions begin with a certain twisted logic but descend by the end into a circus of the absurd.</p> <p class="p3">In one of my favourite set-ups, he attempts to help the owner of a small electronics store. His advice is to use the retail giant Best Buy&rsquo;s price-match policy against them, pricing all the televisions at $1 so that Best Buy have to do the same. The plan is to purchase all the bargains from Best Buy, and then mark them up. But, once the small store slashes their prices to $1, Fielder has to prevent customers immediately buying the televisions, so he sets up an obstacle course that includes a tiny door and a live alligator.</p> <p class="p3">Fielder also executive-produced <em>How To with John Wilson</em>, a comedy documentary series now on BBC iPlayer. Always behind the camera, Wilson chronicles life in New York, using his footage to tell a themed story in each episode. Other than Wilson&rsquo;s narration (more intentionally awkward and unpolished than Fielder&rsquo;s), there is no acting on display: what we see for the most part is real New Yorkers going about their day, made to look absurd through Wilson&rsquo;s lens. A woman carrying a pillow down the street. A man who has tied a clear bag of bread around a handrail on the subway. It&rsquo;s all funny because it&rsquo;s all true.</p> <h2 class="p4">Slices of believable life</h2> <p class="p5">What makes <em>The Rehearsal</em> and Fielder&rsquo;s other work so effective is that we are watching real people through the prism of an unusual mind. Neither Wilson nor Fielder are purveyors of the comedy of cringe, as perfected by Ricky Gervais in <em>The Office</em>. Something different is going on here.</p> <p class="p3">It&rsquo;s a fascinating time for comedy, a genre that depends to a large extent on subverting expectations. The contemporary decline in studio sitcoms like <em>Fawlty Towers</em> and <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> has been well documented, with the popularity of dark, character-driven comedies like <em>Fleabag</em> both explaining and capitalising on this shift. For a while, it seems, audiences have been less and less keen on being reminded of a show&rsquo;s inherent artifice. Thirty years ago, if you launched a sitcom, you&rsquo;d have a studio audience. In 2022, thanks to shows like <em>The Royle Family, The Office</em> and <em>The Thick of It</em>, the aim is the exact opposite: construct a world that makes the audience feel as though they are a fly on the wall. There are exceptions &ndash; <em>Mrs Brown&rsquo;s Boys</em> is hugely popular &ndash; but the contemporary drift towards single-camera naturalism is unmistakable.</p> <p class="p3">Equally difficult to ignore is the preponderance of the panel show, a low-stakes way of making audiences laugh. One of the biggest comedy phenomena in recent years is Channel 4&rsquo;s <em>Taskmaster</em>, in which five celebrities &ndash; mostly comedians &ndash; complete a series of bizarre challenges. Not a show that naturally invites comparisons to Fielder&rsquo;s work, it is nonetheless joyful because we see comedians dropping the mask and responding to insane challenges as themselves. For similar reasons, the BBC1 panel show <em>Would I Lie to You?</em> is unendingly popular: audiences like pondering what&rsquo;s true and what&rsquo;s not, again watching comedians play heightened versions of themselves.</p> <p class="p3">The common denominator here is authenticity: panel shows thrive on their relatability; single-camera sitcoms are appealling for their ability to depict slices of believable life. What falls between the two stools is the theatricality of the studio sitcom.</p> <p class="p5">This balance between the real and the artificial occurs in every medium. In the world of fine art, expressionism was in part a reaction against naturalism. Are Fielder, Wilson et al<em> </em>the expressionists or the naturalists here? An argument could be mounted for both.</p> <p class="p3">Studio sitcoms are never fully able to escape their artifice, but there are interesting examples that push at the limits of the form, such as the recent comedy drama <em>Kevin Can F**k Himself,</em> divided between a fake studio set and the grimmer reality on the other side of its doors. The show has been rightly praised for deconstructing the much-loved family sitcom, in order to give us access to the inner world of the genre&rsquo;s traditional supporting character: the patient, put-upon wife. The show plays with our understanding of reality, much like a mockumentary, but is still firmly wedded to the studio space.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Real and on camera?</span></h2> <p class="p3">Outside of the confines of a television studio, there is arguably more freedom to make riskier choices. Both <em>The Rehearsal</em> and <em>How To with John Wilson</em> inspire fascinating questions about audiences and observation. Are their creators attempting to construct something that is as real as possible, or are they making the point that it can never truly be &ldquo;real&rdquo;, so long as there are cameras around?</p> <p class="p3">Because they do away with a studio audience and the rhythms to which the format adheres, shows like <em>The Rehearsal </em>and <em>How To with John Wilson</em> can be more audacious in how they swerve between comedy and drama &ndash; or even a kind of tragedy. Travelling around alone, Wilson&rsquo;s voiceover reflections on how to find meaning in life are often sweet and melancholic. In <em>The Rehearsal</em>, Fielder can flip from making a joke about oranges being Satanic, to wondering aloud about the nature of the self: &ldquo;I was starting to lose track of which version of myself I was supposed to be in these rehearsals.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p5">As <em>The Rehearsal</em> gets into its stride, it starts to ask more nuanced questions about reality. Take the elaborate parenting &ldquo;rehearsal&rdquo; Fielder runs for a woman about to be a mother. In order to simulate the experience through time, he uses actors of various ages, who are swapped in and out as the child &ldquo;grows&rdquo;. Fielder, meanwhile, plays the father. One child actor, too young to understand the conceit, can&rsquo;t stop calling him &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo; off camera, sending the programme into difficult waters.</p> <p class="p3">Fielder has been criticised for the ethics of his work, but <em>The Rehearsal</em> is notable for attempting to deal with this within the show. &ldquo;Do you want to feel something? Do you want to feel something real?&rdquo; one female actor asks Fielder as he begins to lose his grip on his increasingly complex experiment. This actor has been employed to rehearse the interactions Fielder is going to have with another woman playing the mother in the parenting simulation: rehearsals within rehearsals, for an authentic social interaction that may never arrive. In the inevitably feverish analysis<em>,</em> fans are asking if the &ldquo;real&rdquo; people in the show (such as the prospective mother) are in fact also performers.</p> <p class="p3">Both<em> The Rehearsal</em> and <em>How To with John Wilson </em>acknowledge that, in a world where we are bombarded with more content than ever, it is a challenge to distinguish between the real and the contrived. &ldquo;Unfortunately, most of what we take for spontaneity usually just turns out to be part of a meticulous plan,&rdquo; says Wilson in one of his episodes. It&rsquo;s a nod to an uncomfortable truth: we may never really know.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>

This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
