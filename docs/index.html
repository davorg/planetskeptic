<p class="lead">The College of Psychologists in Ontario has threatened to yank Jordan Peterson&#8217;s license if he wouldn&#8217;t take a course on professionalism in social media (it&#8217;s obvious that he needs it). Peterson challenged the decision in court.</p>
<p>The courts have spoken. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jordan-peterson-court-case-decision-1.6943845">He better take that course</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Last November, Peterson, a professor emeritus with the University of Toronto psychology&#8217;s department who is also an author and media commentator, was ordered by the College of Psychologists of Ontario to undergo a coaching program on professionalism in public statements.</p>
<p>That followed numerous complaints to the governing body of Ontario psychologists, of which Peterson is a member, regarding his online commentary directed at politicians, a plus-sized model, and transgender actor Elliot Page, among other issues. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jordan-peterson-college-psychologists-tweets-1.6711524">You can read more about those social media posts here</a>.</p>
<p>The college&#8217;s complaints committee concluded his controversial public statements could amount to professional misconduct and ordered Peterson to pay for a media coaching program — noting failure to comply could mean the loss of his licence to practice psychology in the province.</p>
<p>Peterson filed for a judicial review, arguing his political commentary is not under the college&#8217;s purview.</p>
<p><strong>The Ontario Divisional Court has dismissed Peterson&#8217;s application</strong>, ruling that the college&#8217;s decision falls within its mandate to regulate the profession in the public interest and does not affect his freedom of expression.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to imagine myself in his position &#8212; it&#8217;s not that hard, although I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been quite as maladroit and hateful on social media as Peterson. If I was threatened with loss of my position &#8212; I don&#8217;t have the external resources he does &#8212; and told I need to take a course in social media professionalism, I&#8217;d shrug and do it. Maybe I&#8217;d learn something. Peterson just hates to be told that he&#8217;s wrong about anything.</p>
<p>Peterson says he hasn&#8217;t undermined his profession at all.</p>
<blockquote><p>He denies that he has brought disrepute to the profession, arguing the opposite is true.</p>
<p><q>I think I&#8217;ve done demonstrably more than any psychologist has ever produced to increase the prestige and trust of the practice of psychology around the world,</q> Peterson said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can think of no one who has done more harm to the reputation of psychology than Jordan Peterson. He&#8217;s a narcissistic blabbermouth who invents, and teaches, garbage ideas.</p>

<p class="lead">Oh, Wisconsin. The <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/education/2023/08/22/what-to-know-about-university-of-wisconsin-system-budget-for-2023-24/70645598007/">Republicans want to strangle their university system</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had proposed a $305 million increase for the UW System over the next two school years.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers instead cut state funding for campuses by $32 million in an effort to defund diversity offices, which they see as a waste of money.</p>
<p>UW-Madison will bear the brunt, losing $7 million, or 44%, of this year&#8217;s $16 million cut. The university enrolls about one-third of UW System students. UW-Madison declined to comment on the cut.</p></blockquote>
<p>Diversity offices are a waste of money? Only if you think only wealthy and middle class white people deserve a university education…which, I will admit, is true to the Republican ethos. Don&#8217;t worry, though, they&#8217;re dangling a carrot with the promise of restoring the money. All the university has to do is focus on vocational programs and cut all the diversity and equity programs. This is</p>
<blockquote><p>UW System has a chance to recoup the $32 million budget cut. Officials must present a plan to the Republican-controlled budget-writing committee on how campuses would spend the money on workforce development.</p>
<p>The Regents will receive a preview of the plan in October, said UW System chief finance officer Sean Nelson. Spending will focus on engineering, data, science and nursing programs.</p>
<p>Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said the UW System won&#8217;t get its money back unless it eliminates diversity and equity programs — an idea UW officials have previously shot down.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope these campuses start by eliminating their unnecessary (diversity, equity and inclusion) positions,&#8221; he said in a statement responding to the latest furlough news. &#8220;It would be a first step in showing they’re serious about cutting wasteful spending, shoring up their deficits, and working with the Legislature to develop sustainable long-term funding solutions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, great. My daughter is currently on the job market, and the kinds of jobs she&#8217;s looking for are in biomedical computing &#8212; so those positions aren&#8217;t in immediate danger. But a healthy workplace in academia or industry requires a good balance, and also requires diversity, so this is a long-term threat.</p>
<p>Another long-term problem is that we&#8217;ve been starving the universities in Minnesota as well as Wisconsin.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ten of the 13 universities are projecting deficits this year, too, and many are taking significant action to rein in spending. UW-Oshkosh is laying off 200 employees and mandating furloughs for all other staff. UW-Parkside and UW-Platteville are considering similar measures.</p>
<p>Most campuses are using money from a tuition increase to offset their deficits. The Regents voted earlier this year to increase in-state undergraduate tuition across all 13 universities by about 5%. It was the first time since 2012.</p>
<p>Many campuses are also tapping tuition balances, which is what campuses carry over as their main source of reserves. They&#8217;ve been spending down their reserves for more than a decade. UW-Oshkosh, for example, said it expects to deplete its balances by the end of this school year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not sustainable,&#8221; Rothman put it plainly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, this is the Republican agenda. Diversity programs are just the latest crack in the system that they&#8217;re hammering on, but make no mistake: the ultimate goal is the destruction of <em>all</em> of higher ed.</p>

But while they are a visual delight, the vast vacuum of outer space isn&rsquo;t a multi-sensory experience. It&rsquo;s silent and cold. So Nasa have risen to the challenge of creating engaging experiences as a replacement. They&rsquo;re converting gravitational and cosmic light waves to sound waves to improve our appreciation of what is really going on out there. One of the latest observations to undergo this sonification treatment is the light emitted when dust is swallowed by a black hole.</p> <p>The study detected X-rays (a form of electromagnetic radiation, similar to visible light) originating from materials being dragged into the supermassive black hole at the centre of our Milky Way. The twinkling of X-rays reflected from the surrounding gas clouds was then transformed by Nasa into a musical equivalent. The result is as strange as it is beautiful. If seeing is believing, then hearing is experiencing.</p> <p>The new publication was led by the University of Strasbourg and the X-rays were detected by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer satellite &ndash; a joint US and Italian mission.</p> <p>The rays were emitted when gas and dust approached the black hole and passed the point of no return. The dust particles were accelerated to high speeds under the gargantuan gravitational pull of the black hole, ripped apart into constituent ions and electrons that were then whipped up to near the speed of light, causing the emission of a flare of high-energy light at the very edge of the dark abyss.</p> <p>Those X-rays, being massless and unaffected by the black hole&rsquo;s super gravity, were able to escape outwards and bounced around among the clouds that orbit the black hole. These reflections are what we &ldquo;hear&rdquo; in the video. It&rsquo;s one of many sonifications of data from objects in space that Nasa has produced to make astronomical images accessible to visually impaired people, and to deepen our connection with the physics we are observing. Search &ldquo;singing black holes&rdquo; to find the recording or &ldquo;Nasa sonifications&rdquo; to find others in the Cosmic Harmonies series.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

Credit: 10 Downing Street/Open Government Licence" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bojo.jpg" height="696" alt="Boris Johnson signs the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement" width="1024"></strong></p> <p><strong>Resign,</strong><em> 13th century: To give up an office or to relinquish a position to another person</em></p> <p>Resigning has become quite fashionable. It has its advantages: it can seem honourable and principled or even powerful enough to wash away perceived or actual faults and misdeeds. However, if it takes too long, the person leaving office may carry the odour of delay: &ldquo;clinging on till the inevitable&rdquo;, people cry.</p> <p>The most notable resignation of late has been that of Boris Johnson, who, not content with one resignation, has done it twice. Some suspect that the second departure was a way of weaselling out of facing the music. Like Macavity the Mystery Cat in T. S. Eliot&rsquo;s <em>Old Possum&rsquo;s Book of Practical Cats</em>, he &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t there&rdquo; when the House of Commons finally voted on a report that said he had misled the House.</p> <p>The word has been in use on these islands since the 13th century, a time when Norman French and Middle English were beginning to blend. The original meaning in Norman French was the idea of giving up on sin rather than chucking in your job. We can play in our minds with the idea that when people shout &ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; they half-mean &ldquo;Stop sinning!&rdquo;</p> <p>Shakespeare grasped the drama of the moment in the first of his history plays, when usurper Bolingbroke says to Richard II, &ldquo;Are you contented to resign the crown?&rdquo; And the wavering Richard replies: &ldquo;Ay no; no ay.&rdquo; How many others since Shakespeare&rsquo;s Richard have thought such thoughts?</p> <p>There is also a parallel meaning to the word: where we are &ldquo;resigned&rdquo; to our fate or situation. There&rsquo;s an example of this in Henry Fielding&rsquo;s Tom Jones (1749): &ldquo;He should insist on the most resigned Obedience from his Daughter.&rdquo; If you know the story, you&rsquo;ll understand why we might say, tongue in cheek, &ldquo;Best of luck with that, Squire!&rdquo;</p> <p>At the time of writing, several Conservative MPs have resigned along with Boris Johnson, though one &ndash; Nadine Dorries &ndash; seems to have gone for the Richard II method. We are in what we might call the &ldquo;Ay no; no ay&rdquo; moment. It&rsquo;s nice to see that Ms Dorries might have been inspired by Shakespeare. She was the culture minister, after all.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

Many studies have highlighted the importance of factors such as age, weight (or body mass index) and existing conditions to an individual&rsquo;s risk of infection, hospitalisation and death. But it also turned out that the picture was more complex.</p> <p>From the earliest days of the pandemic, there was an explosion of large studies trying to understand how our genetics might help explain the virus&rsquo;s diverse and often mysterious disease trajectory. One such effort was from a global consortium of doctors and scientists known as GenOMICC, which had already been looking into genetic determinants of severe illness following infection.</p> <p>Over the first two years of the pandemic, tens of thousands of samples were taken from critically ill Covid patients, many from intensive care units. Analyses were then conducted to try to identify genes that might be associated with the worst patient outcomes. Severe responses to Covid-19 often involve a total breakdown in normal immune signalling. This can result in a dangerous influx of normally helpful immune cells and proteins into the sites of infection (lungs, in this case). It is therefore not surprising that many of the 49 genetic variants identified as being associated with critical illness from Covid code for proteins involved in immunity.</p> <p>In May, in the journal <em>Nature</em>, GenOMICC reported finding links between severe Covid and a wide range of genes and their patterns of activity. Encouragingly, some are already known targets of existing drugs that could potentially be repurposed for treatment of severe Covid. The report also identified an association between severe illness and multiple genes involved in how the virus actually enters the patient&rsquo;s cells. These findings provide useful insights into how an individual&rsquo;s route to infection, as well as their biological response to it, may determine why some people get critically ill with Covid, whilst close to a third of us have no symptoms at all.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

All are in Africa and Latin America: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Mali, Sudan, Venezuela and Cameroon.</p> <p>Sudan&rsquo;s inclusion on the list is notable because the research for the report was done in 2022 &ndash; before the outbreak of violence between the military junta and the rebel Rapid Support Forces that has killed thousands and displaced millions since April.</p> <p>Already in 2022, a third of Sudan&rsquo;s population required aid amid a political and economic crisis and the impacts of climate change, according to the NRC, but less than half of the required funding was received. What&rsquo;s more, the country was hosting over a million refugees from other countries, many of whom have now had to flee again.</p> <p>There was a spike in coverage of the crisis after the outbreak of war this year. Data from Google Trends, which gives an indication of how much the search engine&rsquo;s hundreds of millions of users are following a topic, shows that searches for &ldquo;Sudan&rdquo; rose quickly in April. But by May they had more or less returned to previous levels, even though the conflict and accompanying atrocities are far from over. By contrast, searches for &ldquo;Ukraine&rdquo; remain elevated nearly 18 months after the war began.</p> <p>The UK has created no safe passage for refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan. Home Secretary Suella Braverman suggested that those wanting to seek asylum in Britain could present themselves to the UN Refugee Agency for resettlement, but such a scheme doesn&rsquo;t exist. Neighbouring countries, particularly Egypt and Chad, are hosting hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees alone, with the potential for instability to spill over.</p> <p>The UK and other governments could and should be doing so much more, from creating asylum routes to providing humanitarian aid and engaging in serious diplomatic efforts. But far from that, the UK has actually cut aid to many of these neglected crises in recent years.</p> <p>&ldquo;None of these countries is neglected by accident,&rdquo; the report authors write. &ldquo;The powerful response to the suffering inflicted by the war in Ukraine has shown that neglect is in fact a choice. Where there is the will, political action can be impactful and swift, funding vast, and media coverage extensive.&rdquo; Humanitarian compassion cannot be based on geopolitics. While there is a limit to what we can do as individuals, we urge our readers to keep learning about these crises and pushing for action wherever possible.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

The College is a non-profit community youth development organisation that uses magic to offer hope to young people in and around Cape Town.  They do incredible work and for the past two years I have been working with them and Vanishing Inc (the largest magic retailer in the world ) to produce a unique  magic booklet and custom deck of cards for budding magicians. </p>

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks to Podimo and TellTale studios for supporting and producing the podcast.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->
