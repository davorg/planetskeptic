            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">I think I poisoned my brain on Sunday reading these <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/10/23/who-the-heck-is-gilbert-ling/">claims about different phases of water</a>. Or, at least, I poisoned my Google algorithms because now this crap keeps gurgling up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one that&#8217;s so over-the-top it was almost amusing, except that it&#8217;s <a href="https://thewellnessenterprise.com/dr-gerald-pollack/" rel="nofollow">a commercial site using ludicrous claims about biology to sell miracle water</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Dr. Gerald Pollack is a biomedical engineering research scientist from the University of Washington that discovered a new state of water beyond liquid, solid and vapor. H3O2, sometimes called gel water, structured water or exclusion zone water (EZ water), is in between a solid and a liquid. An extra hydrogen molecule and an extra oxygen molecule make it silkier than H2O. This matters because that 70 – 90% you’ve heard about in your body is actually H3O2. That’s why water doesn’t come gushing out of you like a hose if you get a cut. Your cells are full of the thicker, H3O2. </p></blockquote>
<p>Oooh, silkier. How do they measure that? Also cool that they think I&#8217;d turn into a firehose if I only contained normal water.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Water in nature is naturally structured even though you can’t see any form in it. At a molecular level, under a microscope water has shapes that are organized in geometric patterns. Spring water, waterfalls and glaciers are structured. And the water in fruits and vegetables is naturally structured. What Dr. Gerald Pollack has revealed to us is that if we want to get our bodies into alignment with nature and health, we need to be thinking about hydration with structured water.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes. Put water under a microscope and you&#8217;ll be able to see the geometric patterns. I guess it&#8217;s supposed to look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/h3o2.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/h3o2.jpeg" alt="" width="474" height="176" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68287" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/h3o2.jpeg 474w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/h3o2-150x56.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/10/h3o2-300x111.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></a></p>
<p>If your water looks nothing like that, you can buy a tube full of quartz crystals that will structure your tap water for the low, low, low price of only $1799.</p>
<p>Man, this is an <em>amazing</em> racket.</p>

<p class="lead">While I was digging into the question of <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/10/23/who-the-heck-is-gilbert-ling/">who this Gilbert Ling character was</a>, I ran into lots of sources that didn&#8217;t make the final cut. Unfortunately, most of those sources were from fringe or unsavory places &#8212; I did check my collection of textbooks, too, and nowhere does he get any mention. So it&#8217;s down into the sewers after all! Like this <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7GSy4kofTBaXcPWXi/thermodynamics-of-intelligence-and-cognitive-enhancement">article on Less Wrong</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Association-Induction hypothesis formulated by Gilbert Ling is an alternate view of cell function, which suggests a distinct functional role of energy within the cell. I won&#8217;t review it in detail here, but you can find an easy to understand and comprehensive introduction to this hypothesis in the book &#8220;Cells, Gels and the Engines of Life&#8221; by Gerald H. Pollack. This idea has a long history with considerable experimental evidence, which is too extensive to review in this article.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, it has a 70 year history all centered on the long-winded writings of a single crackpot. There is no experimental evidence for any of it other than the willful distortions of one Gilbert Ling. Pollack is utterly batty, and not a credible source.</p>
<p>Worse still, this guy is using Ling&#8217;s theories as a starting point for discussing how we can use this information to potentially increase IQ.</p>
<blockquote><p>So this suggests a &#8216;systems biology&#8217; approach to cognitive enhancement. It&#8217;s necessary to consider how metabolism is regulated, and what substrates it requires. To raise intelligence in a safe and effective way, all of these substrates must have increased availability to the neuron, in appropriate ratios.</p>
<p>I am always leery of drawing analogies between brains and computers but this approach to cognitive enhancement is very loosely analogous to over-clocking a CPU. Over-clocking requires raising both the clock rate, and the energy availability (voltage). In the case of the brain, the effective &#8216;clock rate&#8217; is controlled by hormones (primarily triiodothyronine aka T3), and energy availability is provided by glucose and other nutrients.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh god. Nerds discussing overly simplistic analogies between brains and computers always makes me leery, too, so just stop already. Especially when your &#8216;over-clocking&#8217; idea is built on a bogus model of cellular metabolism that has been known to be wrong for the entirety of its &#8220;long history&#8221;.</p>
<p>I know I started this by dissing the Less Wrong forum, but I will say that, to their credit, most of the commenters were tearing that article apart.</p>

<p class="lead">At least this <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/opinion-pieces/2022/10/isolation-and-feelings-of-being-unwanted-confront-students-of-color-at-too-diverse-university-of-minnesota-morris/">article focuses on the perspective of the students</a> &#8212; they&#8217;re pissed off. But hey, I recognized a bunch of the students they highlighted!</p>
<p>I also think one student made a particularly good point. Paradoxically, with great diversity comes great isolation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mercedese Young Man said she often feels alone on the campus and in the western Minnesota town.</p>
<p>“I feel isolated,” said Young Man, who is in her first semester at Morris. “Before (Sviggum) said all of that I was going to my counselors and telling them I was having a hard time adjusting to being here.”</p>
<p>Young Man, who sat for nearly an hour by herself in the school café seating area, said she transferred to Morris because of its supposed diversity, but she said that’s not the case. Officially Morris can boast of a robustly diverse population – 41% students of color, of that 32% Native American of a total student population of 1,068 – but Young Man disputed those numbers.</p>
<p>“There are just a handful of Native students here and all from separate tribes,” said Young Man, who is from Oglala, South Dakota. “In several of my classes I’m the only person … maybe one other … person of color.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The raw statistics tends to lump all these students into one mass &#8212; &#8220;students of color&#8221; and &#8220;Native American&#8221; &#8212; but they all see themselves as something far more specific. I&#8217;ve known students who are Navajo and Delaware, as well as the regional Lakota and Dakota peoples. There are also Hmong and Somali and Nigerian and Latino and Filipino students here, and just sweeping them into a pile and calling them our diverse brown students is insulting and inadequate.</p>
<p>Bugger Sviggum, we should just listen to the students and follow their suggestions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the point of UMN Morris’ declining enrollment, Strukel and Kadlec may have unintentionally offered up a marketing campaign for the university.<br />
“We’re unique here because we’re so separated from the fast-paced world. Here it’s who’s around you; that’s who you got,” said Kadlec. “There’s no Target or Walmart here to take my money so I’m forced to be here on campus with my friends; and that’s not bad at all.”</p>
</blockquote>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>

This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
