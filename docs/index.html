<p class="lead">I was looking forward to a mellow, relaxed Fall term, when the office of human resources sent me this memo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Faculty and Staff, </p>
<p>As you may have read in the news, <a href="https://cannabis.mn.gov/">Governor Walz recently signed a bill into law legalizing the use of marijuana for recreational purposes</a> by adults age 21 and over as well as the right to grow up to eight plants for personal use. The new law will also decriminalize its possession and expunge misdemeanor marijuana offenses from criminal records.</p>
<p>While the new law may begin to shift societal norms outside the workplace, University employees will still be expected to follow the University‚Äôs Drug-Free policy, Smoke-and Tobacco-Free policy, and Code of Conduct, which outlines the responsibilities of employees to ‚Äúact according to the highest ethical and professional standards of conduct‚Äù and ‚Äúbe personally accountable for individual actions.‚Äù </p>
<p>As has been the standard procedure in the past, employees who violate these policies and perform work while impaired due to the use of controlled substances are subject to disciplinary action, including termination. Additionally, while the new law allows for the growing of cannabis plants at home, no such plants grown for personal use are allowed on any University property nor should such plants be visible on camera during remote work. Please also note that the legalization of marijuana at the state level does not change the federal DOT Drug policy for drivers, of which the University has about 100 employees. All members of our University community are responsible for encouraging compliance with these policies.</p>
<p>If you, or someone you are concerned about, need help with substance misuse, the University has resources available to you, including confidential counseling and chemical health consultation through the Employee Assistance Program and mental health resources for University employees and their dependents enrolled in the medical plan.</p>
<p>We appreciate your awareness and compliance with this issue in support of protecting the health of our entire community.</p></blockquote>
<p>Darn. I guess the backup plan is MDMA.</p>
<p>(No, actually, I don&#8217;t partake of anything anymore, not even alcohol. I have no idea what the students will be doing to make my classes tolerable.)</p>

<p class="lead">He&#8217;s fallen far now, and seems to think that thrashing about in the muck will raise him up, rather than make him dirtier. He&#8217;s got an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f92e.png" alt="ü§Æ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, titled <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-scientists-sexuality-doesnt-matter-nsf-dei-agenda-census-gender-awards-3e1e7ac2?mod=e2two">&#8220;A Scientist‚Äôs Sexuality Shouldn‚Äôt Matter&#8221;</a>. I agree, it shouldn&#8217;t, but we&#8217;re dealing with facts here rather than a disgruntled conservative&#8217;s feelings, and it does matter, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Krauss is upset because federal grant agencies ask applicants about various bits of demographic data.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>The Survey of Earned Doctorates is an annual census of new postgraduate research degrees. The National Science Foundation, a federal agency, collects data on academic discipline, sex, race, ethnicity, debt burden, disability and citizenship. The results are used by government, universities and industry to track the demographics of women and minorities in STEM &#8212; science, technology, engineering and math.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, yes, it&#8217;s a <em>survey</em>. That&#8217;s what surveys do. Krauss wants them to stop because &#8212; wait for it &#8212; sexism is over! According to a notorious sex pest, that is.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>The sex and race data &#8212; the latter has been collected since 1975 &#8212; was initially useful in efforts to overcome barriers to women and minorities in academia. Those barriers have largely disappeared, yet quotas and preferential hiring have persisted. After such a concerted effort, demographic disparities are less likely to point to systemic biases in academia than to underlying societal factors.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s especially true when it comes to disparities of sex. Women earn a majority of postbaccalaureate degrees over all STEM disciplines in the U.S. Since female undergraduates outnumber male ones by about 3 to 2, this trend is likely to continue. Further, a recent large-scale study found that previous claims about sex bias in academic science were overblown. Tenure-track women and men in STEM receive comparable grant funding, journal acceptances and recommendation letters, and women have an edge in hiring.</p></blockquote>
<p>What quotas? What preferential hiring? I&#8217;ve been in a lot of job searches over the years, and we&#8217;re told over and over by the administration that there are questions we can&#8217;t ask, and they&#8217;re all about <em>avoiding</em> bias. I&#8217;d agree that there are fewer biases in academia (but not no biases) because of policies Krauss doesn&#8217;t like, and that we&#8217;re dealing with larger societal factors, but academia is part of society, if you hadn&#8217;t noticed.</p>
<p>A good example of those societal factors: undergraduate women outnumber men, especially at liberal arts colleges like mine. Is this a good thing? Nobody thinks so. It&#8217;s not at all because we preferentially admit women &#8212; please, high school men, do apply and come to UMM, we love you all &#8212; but because when universities <em>stopped</em> discriminating against women, many women saw a college education as a tool for escaping traditional roles. Liberal arts colleges also actively encourage students to explore new ideas, which is appealing if you want something more than a fast-track to a job.</p>
<p>Of course, to a white man the barriers are invisible, so they don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Such personal matters are irrelevant to science and essentially invisible. In my 40 years in academia, I have worked with all sorts of colleagues and students. Many were highly eccentric, but that didn&#8217;t matter if they were good scientists. As one colleague put it: &#8220;You are teaching a chemistry or physics course. Your lectures describe concepts and present equations. &#8216;Suppose a magnet is moving relative to a loop of wire.&#8217; You barely know any of your students. You give tests and grade them. You have no idea, nor care about, the &#8216;sexual orientation&#8217; of any of your students. . . . What career barriers are there?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What a blinkered ass‚Ä¶you might as well say, &#8220;no one is trying to rape <em>me</em>, therefore rape and sexual harassment are not a problem anywhere.&#8221; Which is just what a self-centered serial harasser would say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also appalled at the idea that a professor just lectures and gives tests and grades them and doesn&#8217;t need to know anything about their students. What university was this at? Krauss should have mentioned it so everyone would know to avoid it. <em>Of course</em> we are and should be aware of our students&#8217; lives, to a degree. We invite deeper interactions than just talking at and grading them &#8212; I listen when students are struggling and try to help them resolve conflicts and issues.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even understand this factory-style approach to impersonal teaching.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Asking respondents if they&#8217;re &#8220;transgender,&#8221; &#8220;gender non-conforming,&#8221; &#8220;nonbinary,&#8221; &#8220;gender-fluid&#8221; or &#8220;genderqueer&#8221; is patently ridiculous. These are subjective categories, unobservable by others unless the person in question makes it a point to label himself publicly. Most scientists, like ordinary people, couldn&#8217;t even define most of these terms, let alone use them as a basis for discrimination.</p></blockquote>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to define the terms, you just need to categorize your students and colleagues as <q>highly eccentric</q>.</p>
<p>This is peak clueless offensiveness, though. Non-heterosexual identities are <q>patently ridiculous</q> and mere <q>subjective categories</q>? They matter to the people who have them, and what also matters is professors who so callously dismiss their lived identities. You know, the ones who think people who aren&#8217;t like them are not <q>ordinary people</q>.</p>
<p>Jesus. Krauss is making me aware that we do discriminate. If we were interviewing a job candidate and they spewed out that stuff about how teaching is just about giving tests and grading them, calling gay and trans students <q>eccentric</q> and <q>patently ridiculous</q>, it&#8217;s true &#8212; there&#8217;s no way we&#8217;d hire them. We try not to employ assholes.</p>
<p>Also, we&#8217;d rather not hire stupid people. Krauss even quotes the goals of these agencies, but doesn&#8217;t understand them.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>What&#8217;s the purpose of all this? Nature magazine paraphrases a statement from the NSF&#8217;s chief diversity and inclusion officer, Charles Barber: &#8220;Collecting these data will help the NSF and other agencies to analyse employers&#8217; policies and procedures for addressing unintended barriers to employment, advancement and inclusion.&#8221; The magazine then quotes Mr. Barber: &#8220;This gives us an opportunity to create more opportunities and broaden participation to yield equitable outcomes for the LGBTQIA+ community and others.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes. Collecting data to detect &#8220;unintended barriers to employment, advancement and inclusion.&#8221; How would you know if an organization discriminates, unintentionally or otherwise, if you have no information about the population of a class known to be subject to bias? How would you know if an organization has successfully knocked down all barriers to advancement if you don&#8217;t look? Krauss is advocating willful blindness to abuse and harassment and bias‚Ä¶unsurprisingly, for a guy with his history. If those meddling kids hadn&#8217;t noticed and reported his behavior, he&#8217;d still have a job!</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Does that mean quotas?</p></blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>If so, how would one even go about determining the &#8220;correct&#8221; proportion of &#8220;queer&#8221; or &#8220;genderqueer&#8221; scientists? The percentage of the population that espouses these labels is so small that any data the NSF gathers will be statistically useless.</p></blockquote>
<p>The correct proportion is one that roughly matches the proportion in the general population, because that would indicate that there&#8217;s probably an absence of selective bias. That wasn&#8217;t so hard, Larry.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of astonishing to see a <em>physicist</em> dismissing an event as insignificant because the frequency is too low. What happened to 5-sigma, Larry? Does the Higgs boson not matter because it&#8217;s so difficult to see that you have to spend billions of dollars to detect it? Most of the stars in the sky are not exploding, so why waste our time looking for novas? The frequency of stellar class A stars is only 0.63% &#8212; can we just ignore them, then? Heck, our sun falls into a group that makes up less than 8% of all stars. Must not be important, then.</p>
<p>You know we can detect all kinds of numbers if we just look. Here&#8217;s a result of the US census &#8212; over a million &#8216;eccentric&#8217; people <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2019/comm/living-together-same-sex.html">live in same-sex relationships</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/same-sex-couples.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/same-sex-couples-500x528.png" alt="" width="500" height="528" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70276" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/same-sex-couples-500x528.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/same-sex-couples-142x150.png 142w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/same-sex-couples-284x300.png 284w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/05/same-sex-couples.png 618w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>We also know, because people <em>looked</em> at the data, that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-study-estimates-16-million-us-identify-transgender-2022-06-10/">over 1.6 million &#8216;ordinary&#8217; people are transgender</a>, and that the proportion is rising as social barriers fall.</p>
<blockquote><p>A study published on Friday estimates that nearly 1.64 million people over the age of 13 in the United States identify themselves as transgender, based on an analysis of newly expanded federal health surveys.</p>
<p>The study estimates that about 0.5% of all U.S. adults, some 1.3 million people, and about 1.4%, or 300,000, of youth between 13- and 17-years-old identify as transgender, having a different gender identity than the sex they were assigned at birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really don&#8217;t understand this frequency based argument. Can we just ignore 1.3 million people, or worse, oppress and discriminate against them? They&#8217;re statistically useless, you know. It&#8217;s just that they are <em>people</em>.</p>
<p>Wow, Krauss has become a right-wing cartoon at this point.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Another way that AI is hurting us: it&#8217;s being used to generate science spam that is flooding YouTube. Kyle Hill points out that they&#8217;ve SEO&#8217;d their way to the top of video recommendations by, for instance, putting Elon Musk or Joe Rogan or Michio Kaku on the thumbnail (we&#8217;re already in dubious &#8220;science&#8221; territory), and then when you click on it you get this text-to-speech robotic voice reading what sounds like ChatGPT generated word salad accompanied by random images.

<p>A fellow chiropractor ‚Äî whose identity remains a secret to this day ‚Äî saw it and reported her to the Manitoba Chiropractors Association, the regulatory body for her profession.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, some chiropractors believe in an evidence-based approach (then why are they still chiropractors, I wonder?) and others believe in subluxation, which is garbage pseudoscience.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the core of this divide in the profession is subluxation ‚Äî a diagnosis used by some chiropractors to measure the health of someone&#8217;s spine.</p>
<p>If someone has a &#8220;subluxation-free spine,&#8221; there are some in the profession who believe that you don&#8217;t need vaccines or other medical interventions, explained Brian Gleberzon, a Toronto-based chiropractor and former professor at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would be a very traditional belief, and they would hearken back to the developers of the profession,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The subluxationists are out for Carolyn Weiss&#8217;s (the offending believer in vaccinations) blood, sending cease-and-desist letters and demanding the her op-eds be removed and threatening her license to practice chiropractic. They&#8217;re kind of nuts. They police what members say on the net.</p>
<blockquote><p>It led to the association subscribing to a web scraper tool in 2021 that crawls through the professional websites and social media accounts of chiropractors and flags keywords such as &#8220;vaccines.&#8221;</p>
<p>The word &#8220;evidence-based,&#8221; &#8220;principled,&#8221; &#8220;honest,&#8221; and &#8220;ethical&#8221; were also flagged, as the association felt they could be used to make one chiropractor appear superior to another, according to an undated memo from the association to chiropractors obtained by CBC News.</p></blockquote>
<p>The chiropractic association even has a rule that you can&#8217;t discuss vaccination because it is <q>not within the scope of chiropractic practice.</q> Well, yeah. But nothing medical is within the scope of chiropractic. I agree that chiropractors shouldn&#8217;t be dispensing any medical advice, any more than I should, but they are silencing this one thing for all the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never understood why people go to chiropractors &#8212; I suspect it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re cheaper than real physical therapy, they&#8217;re desperate for relief from chronic pain (and haven&#8217;t discovered opioid abuse yet), and chiropractors make wild promises. We have a <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/06/13/chiroquackery-in-morris-minnesota/">quack here in Morris who implied that his chiropractic shop would help cure cancer</a> &#8212; he seems to have adopted a lower profile since I highlighted his sleaze.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="An AI-generated image from Boris Eldagsen's controversial ongoing series, 'Pseudomnesia'" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/boris_eldagsen_THETIE_s-copy.jpg" height="600" alt="An AI-generated image from Boris Eldagsen's controversial ongoing series, 'Pseudomnesia', which shows a black and white, hyper-realistic image of a man and a woman with their arms around each other" width="508"></p> <p>The recent release to the public of a wave of new art and writing tools, such as DALL-E and ChatGPT, has been greeted with an outpouring of alarmist rhetoric. The software, based on artificial intelligence, responds to prompts like &ldquo;create a picture of a woman eating salad and laughing&rdquo; or &ldquo;write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll&rdquo; by searching the web for examples and building on these to create an approximation: an image (though often disturbingly mangled) or something like a poem (at least in the sense that it rhymes). Sometimes the prompt works well and the production can seem magical.</p> <p>Sceptics have been horrified. &ldquo;AI in art&rdquo; is &ldquo;a creditless, thankless, and soulless alternative to the real thing,&rdquo; Jade King complains in the <em>Gamer</em> magazine. Writing in the <em>Washington Post</em>, musician and producer T-Bone Burnett and author Jonathan Taplin worry that AI threatens &ldquo;the core creative act&rdquo; which if &ldquo;radically diminished, or replaced&hellip; will stop culture in its tracks.&rdquo; The underlying fear here is that artificial intelligence will rise up, exploit and replace us. Art &ndash; real art &ndash; is deeply human. These new tools, which scrape the web for content, simply remix and remash without any personal, individual spark.</p> <p>There are real concerns about the way AI picks up source material without payment, just as there were reasonable concerns about the way that early hip-hop artists lifted source tracks without recompensing the original creators. Art under capitalism, like most labour under capitalism, is monetised in ways that benefit those at the top and grind down those at the bottom, and new tech is quickly subverted to that purpose.</p> <p>Exploitation, though, isn&rsquo;t new. Nor is it inhuman. On the contrary, the exploitation of artists is often rationalised by the pretence of art as unquenchable and unbindable individualism. Our most famous music artists may sing about being rebellious and free, but are often trapped in contracts involving financial exploitation, or worse (the latest case being pop star Kesha, accusing her producer of physical and sexual abuse.) If art is your soul, then the business of art is selling your soul, which has some obvious downsides.</p> <p>Why not, instead, embrace the mechanism? Forget originality and the divine afflatus. If the AI is going to control us all, shouldn&rsquo;t we be working to become the AI? Let us seize the means of production of ourselves!</p> <p>That&rsquo;s the essential argument of the wonderful <em>Against Expression</em>, a 590-page anthology of &ldquo;uncreative writing&rdquo; edited by poets Craig Dworkin and Kenneth Goldsmith. Published more than a decade ago, in 2011, it holds some valuable insights for our own fraught cultural moment. The writing in the book is &ldquo;uncreative&rdquo; for the same reason that AI art is often labeled as such. The 100-odd authors in the book create their poems by cutting up or lifting text from other sources: literature, internet detritus, grammar books, psychological testing instruments.</p> <p>The anthology demonstrates the long and rich tradition of such practices. The &ldquo;writers&rdquo; &ndash; including William Burroughs, Kathy Acker, Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol and Claudia Rankine &ndash; find text and then remix and recontextualise. They are less like Byron (&ldquo;Yet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying,/streams like the thunderstorm against the wind&rdquo;) and more like, say, ChatGPT, trawling the internet for content to slice up, rewrite and misinterpret.</p> <p>One of my favorite poems from the anthology is an excerpt from Rory Macbeth&rsquo;s 2007 book <em>The Bible (alphabetized)</em>. It&rsquo;s exactly what the title says: a list of every word in the Bible in alphabetical order, including eight pages of: <br><br>be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be</p> <p>The different authors in the volume aren&rsquo;t different because they have different identities and unique voices. They&rsquo;re different because they draw from different data sets. Macbeth uses the Bible. Nada Gordon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abnormal Discharge&rdquo; (first published in the anthology itself) reproduces post titles from the Women&rsquo;s Health Forum message board (&ldquo;possible pregnancy/vaginal discharge Jessica/Abnormal Pap Smear Jennifer/Abnormal Pap&rdquo;). H. L. Hix&rsquo;s <em>God Bless</em> (2007) is a book of poems entirely composed of phrases from the speeches of George W. Bush and the public statements of Osama bin Laden. Claude Cosky&rsquo;s &ldquo;The First Thousand Numbers Classified in Alphabetical Order&rdquo; begins with &ldquo;Eight, eight-hundred, eight hundred and eight&rdquo; and ends with &ldquo;two-hundred and two.&rdquo;</p> <p>I personally find this impersonal approach to writing exhilarating. I laughed out loud at all those &ldquo;be&rdquo;s. I thought to myself, &ldquo;I never realised that eight was the first number in the alphabetical order.&rdquo; But if you are not, like me, a neurodivergent oddball, you may well be less convinced. Why would anyone read this? Why would anyone write it?</p> <p>Co-editor Goldsmith is most famous for &ldquo;Day&rdquo;, a 2003 poem in which he wrote out the entirety of the <em>New York Times</em> from 1 September 2000. He argues in the preface to <em>After Expression</em> that the rise of uncreative writing is in part a reaction to the increasing manipulability and algorithmicisation of text made possible by the internet. &ldquo;Never before has language had so much materiality &ndash; fluidity, plasticity, malleability &ndash; begging to be actively managed by the writer.&rdquo; T-Bone Burnett sees AI as eating away at originality as it hoovers up old art and spews out garbled and rearranged (but still old) art. Goldsmith, in contrast, thinks the ease of hoovering and spewing is itself a new kind of creation and a new kind of creativity. Which is really more creative: writing (yet another) lyric poem about lost love, or listing every word in the Bible alphabetically?</p> <p>The poetry compiled in <em>Against Expression</em> is a system or a process. When Robert Fitterman rewrites Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s 1926 novel <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> by removing all sentences except for those that begin with the pronoun &ldquo;I,&rdquo; he is both removing the self from literature and centering the self in literature. Is he mocking Hemingway&rsquo;s self-absorption? Enjoying it? Replacing it with his own? It&rsquo;s all of those, I would argue, and also just a joke that makes you laugh &ndash; at once an intimate and universal, and therefore impersonal, response.</p> <p>Similarly, when Dan Farrell turns a psychological diagnostic tool into a series of &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements (&ldquo;I do things that keep me from becoming physically unhealthy. I feel angry. I am pretty angry about things these days&rdquo;), the voice is an eerie mirror of self and soul. There is an &ldquo;I&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not an &ldquo;I&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just an algorithm, a grammatical convenience. The effect is poignant, repulsive, beautiful, uncanny, hard to categorise &ndash; like poetry.</p> <p>To dismiss AI art as &ldquo;soulless&rdquo; is to assume that the purpose of art is to demonstrate soul, to validate a romantic personhood at the centre of culture and existence. But, as <em>Against Expression</em> shows by its inclusion of works by figures like Samuel Beckett and W. B. Yeats, the presence of the soul in art has long been an object of scepticism.</p> <p>This isn&rsquo;t a call for tech utopianism. Algorithmic art, with or without AI assistance, can be moving or tedious, fun or irritating, just like any other kind of creative endeavour. But when we assume we can produce originality via a conventional chord change or rhyming couplet, we may be just another cog in the culture industry&rsquo;s endless grinding soulless reiteration of soul.</p> <p>Artificial intelligence won&rsquo;t free us from this dynamic. But if we listen, it might speak back our own thoughts, or their absence, in words meaningless enough to make some new sense of a tired idea, from &ldquo;be&rdquo; to &ldquo;eight&rdquo; to &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

The soldiers were wholly unprepared, with no masks to protect them.</p> <p>Not wanting to be caught offguard again, the Allies dispatched a chemist to the battlefield, to shed light on this devestating new weapon. Of course, by the time John Scott Haldane and his team arrived the gas had long since dispersed. But subtle clues were left. They noticed a discolouration of the brass buttons on the unfortunate soldiers&rsquo; uniforms. Something had reacted with the zinc and copper in the brass, and the culprit was chlorine.</p> <p>Over 100 years later, inspectors at sites of chemical weapon attacks face a similar problem. The chemical agents are reactive, volatile and frequently work at very low concentrations, all of which make them difficult to detect. Often autopsies are used, but this can be complicated as human remains need careful and considerate collection and transportation.</p> <p>Plants, however, are much easier to work with. This approach has been recently pioneered by a group from TNO Defence in the Netherlands. They exposed plants to mustard gas, sarin (a nerve agent deployed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2013), chlorine and Novichok (used in the 2018 Salisbury attacks). Vegetation survives the exposure, but is not totally unaffected. Each of these agents reacts with proteins within the plants. These modified proteins can be easily extracted and detected using highly sensitive mass spectrometry.</p> <p>The method was tested on basil, stinging nettles and bay laurels, suggesting the approach will likely work for a wide variety of species. The only issue was that exposure to common household bleach generated the same response as chlorine gas. Meaning, in the absence of brass buttons, there is more work to be done to rule out this source of false positives.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the methodology shows strong promise and now just requires some samples from real-world incidents to validate the approach. Let&rsquo;s hope TNO Defence don&rsquo;t get these samples any time soon.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Copyright: The National Gallery" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Ugly-Duchess-cropped-resized.jpg" height="1008" alt="'An Old Woman' - commonly known as 'The Ugly Duchess' - by Quinten Massys. The portrait depicts an old woman with exaggerated features, including a bulging forehead and bosom squeezed into an ill-fitting corset" width="750"></p> <p>It is said that the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis died while laughing at his completed likeness of an ugly old woman. The Flemish artist Quinten Massys survived the painting of &ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&rdquo; (about 1513), but it might have been a close shave. Certainly plenty of people have at least smirked at her in the years since.</p> <p>This is because, and there is no getting around it, she appears ridiculous: bulging forehead, protruding ears, puckered mouth, hairy mole on her cheek, huge horned headdress and shrivelled bosom. She looks beseechingly upwards, clutching a tiny withered rosebud. When the painting was put up for auction in 1920, the <em>New York Times</em> advertised the sale of a &ldquo;portrait which is generally accepted as being the ugliest one in the world&rdquo;. But why is she ugly? And how are we meant to respond?</p> <p>A new exhibition at the National Gallery in London called &ldquo;The Ugly Duchess: Beauty and Satire in the Renaissance&rdquo; successfully answers these questions. It traces the influences on and atmosphere around the conception of &ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&rdquo; &ndash; religious, artistic, misogynistic &ndash; and convincingly places her within a long tradition of negative portrayals of women. There are witches, crones and hags; the incredible grotesques of Leonardo da Vinci; and the creepy John Tenniel illustrations for the 1865 edition of Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. All either influences on, or influenced by, Massys&rsquo; duchess. It is to the considerable credit of this exhibition that it hasn&rsquo;t dampened the fun of these artworks, while brilliantly elucidating the sinister threads that run through them.</p> <p>The first thing that we discover is that the duchess has a partner. A man. Apparently, they were conceived as a pair, then separated and lost to each other for many years. Reunited, they make an odd couple. For one thing he looks remarkably unremarkable, even dull. He is seen in profile wearing a dark velvet cap and dark fur-trimmed coat. He looks prosperous and respectable. He has full lips, heavy lids and a bland expression, with one hand held up towards the duchess. Plainly, an exchange is taking place: his outstretched hand is a response to her proffered rosebud.</p> <p>The exhibition makes clear that this was a familiar trope. The accompanying catalogue informs us that &ldquo;The advent of print culture in the second half of the fifteenth century expanded the repertoire of secular imagery and propelled humorous subjects deriding what were then considered society&rsquo;s ills.&rdquo; One such target of satire was the so-called &ldquo;ill-matched couple&rdquo; &ndash; usually a wrinkled woman or wizened man who is courted by a much younger partner desirous of their wealth. A brilliant example of this genre is provided in the form of an engraving by Israhel van Meckenem called &ldquo;The Unequal Couple&rdquo; (about 1480&ndash;90). A corpse-like woman looks deep into the eyes of a beautiful young man with flowing locks, while his hand travels over the large bag of coins she is clutching.</p> <p><img title="&quot;Alice and the Duchess&quot; (1865) by John Tenniel. Copyright: V&amp;A" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/FF8747.jpg" height="771" width="500"></p> <p>Our couple exhibit more dignified behaviour, yet they too would have been immediately identified as ridiculous. The man (possibly based on the vastly wealthy Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici) is cast as a recognisably smug banker-merchant type, while the woman (rumoured to have been based on the famously ugly Margaret, Countess of Tyrol) is cast as a recognisably freakish grotesque &ndash; a stock character borrowed from Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s <em>visi mostruosi</em> (monstrous faces). Her likeness appears again and again in different works by different artists &ndash; in Florentine engravings, English misericords and French illustrations. In each she is a figure of either fear or fun.</p> <p>One cause for ridicule is her outfit. The outsized headdress and revealing corset, in what was then an outdated and vulgar style, would have immediately marked her out as the &ldquo;embodiment of foolish vanity&rdquo;. The great philosopher Desiderius Erasmus (Massys&rsquo; contemporary and patron) had especial contempt for such overdressed women: &ldquo;Who would put up now with a decent married woman wearing those huge horns and pyramids and cones sticking out from the top of the head and having her brows and temples plucked so that nearly half her head is bald?&rdquo; On seeing such a figure &ldquo;Everyone would laugh and boo.&rdquo; Clearly, in the 16th century, such a get-up was familiar visual comedy: the delusional old woman, full of lust and avarice, mutton dressed as lamb.</p> <p>But amid all the laughing and booing there is also a palpable unease. This is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the exhibition. Old women, their representation made more visceral by the period&rsquo;s furtherance of verisimilitude, are here often depicted as sagging, cackling hags. Due to religious and folkloric superstitions and misunderstandings over how the female body works, there had developed a pervasive fear of women &ndash; in particular, fear of their sexuality. <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> (or <em>The Hammer of Witches</em>, first published in 1486), a treatise written by German Catholic clergyman Heinrich Kramer, declared that &ldquo;all witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which is in women insatiable&rdquo;.</p> <p>This concern can be seen in Massys&rsquo; sly-looking, overdressed hags (those horned headdresses are a sure sign of devil worship), but it finds its battiest representation in the wonderful engraving &ldquo;Morris Dance with the Sausage Woman&rdquo; by the Italian Monogrammist SE. Here, we behold a woman much like the duchess who holds in one hand a spear of phallic sausages and in the other a satanic cloven hoof, while a group of men dance around her.</p> <p>In this image, and elsewhere, older women are depicted as worryingly powerful &ndash; as enchantresses, seducers and subverters of men&rsquo;s rightful position. The most exhilarating example featured in the exhibition is Albrecht D&uuml;rer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat&rdquo; (about 1500). An old, half-undressed woman with sagging breasts and an expression suggesting a full-throated war cry soars across the page on the back of a black, horned goat, scattering four cherubim in her wake. Her hair eerily flows in the opposite direction she is travelling and she suggestively grips the goat&rsquo;s horn. In this disconcerting image of disorder and rebellion there is little for the male viewer to chuckle at.</p> <p><em>In The Witch as Muse: Art, Gender and Power in Early Modern Europe</em>, Linda Hults observes that &ldquo;The sexual drive was believed to be greater in postmenopausal, widowed women. Their sexuality was especially repugnant not only because of their physical appearance but also because it could not lead to procreation.&rdquo;</p> <p>It is interesting that Massys&rsquo; &ldquo;ugliest&rdquo; portrait should have an afterlife as the frightening duchess in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> (beater of babies and owner of the Cheshire Cat). While not mentioned in the exhibition, the portrait also bears a resemblance to the witch in the Studio Ghibli film <em>Spirited Away</em>. She becomes, in these new guises, divorced from the real-life fears and prejudices that shaped her in the first place. She is just a scary template. What is affecting about the items collected at the National Gallery is that they remind us of the uncomfortable themes beneath. In their laughter, sadness or fury, the paintings reflect something in the viewer. Perhaps a guilty conscience.</p> <p>The exhibition holds out the promise of discovering a duchess who is not only grotesque, but also &ldquo;subversive, fierce and defiant&rdquo;. While the curators have gamely tried to reposition her as a more actively destabilising presence, this is ultimately unconvincing. Like it or not, the joke is entirely at her expense. &ldquo;The Ugly Duchess&rdquo; was conceived and executed amid titters, for an audience that was looking for a laugh. Although now, in this concise but wide-ranging exhibition, she might finally be in more sympathetic company.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/The_Beatles_performing_at_The_Ed_Sullivan_Show.jpg" height="641" alt="The Beatles performing on The Ed Sullivan Show" width="921"></p> <p>In my favourite scene from their animated film <em>Yellow Submarine</em>, the cartoon Beatles see a submarine, identical to theirs, going in the opposite direction. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone in it. Look!&rdquo; one remarks. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re waving,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a group of fellas.&rdquo; They wave back, realising that it&rsquo;s themselves, going backwards in time.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve thought often about how strange it must feel, being Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr, seeing their years as the Beatles &ndash; one phase of their long lives &ndash; take on a perpetual existence. And, quite unexpectedly, I&rsquo;ve found myself contributing to that spinning media whirl.</p> <p>In late March, I learned of the existence of an almost complete concert recording of the band made by a 15-year-old student at Stowe boarding school. A few days later, I broadcast the news on my BBC Radio programme Front Row. I had gone to Stowe with the former student, John Bloomfield, to make a special programme about the 60th anniversary of the concert. I had no idea about the tape until Bloomfield, now 75, revealed its existence to me. Listening to the concert transported me back to 4 April 1963, a particular moment in time when a group of privately educated boys saw the future in their encounter with a quartet of working-class boys from Liverpool.</p> <p>Bloomfield had clearly decided now was the time to uncover the &ldquo;lost tape&rdquo;, and I was touched by his trust in me. I alerted Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn and arranged for us to listen to it in full together. Lewisohn told me the tape was genuinely important, for capturing the band in full, at a unique moment and before their gigs became entirely blanketed in screams.</p> <p>Certainly, when Bloomfield played some of the recorded songs from the original school theatre stage, through the modern speakers, I experienced something akin to a transformative moment: a realisation of how mind-blowing the juddering, bone-shaking intensity of their live performance must have been.</p> <p>As time transports us further away from the &rsquo;60s and the Beatles, there is a sense of a growing reverence. Little snippets of film footage or old photographs emerge regularly like religious relics to be gawped at in the news and, as in medieval times, bought up by rich collectors for their private reliquaries. I had no intention of contributing to this trend. My story was really about the social history of that moment &ndash; the unique collision of class and culture that took place during that concert, with its almost entirely male audience.</p> <p>There is a massive mythology that has built up around such moments in the Beatles&rsquo; career, but I think there&rsquo;s a lovely secular power in the fact that the gig has been captured on tape.</p> <p>We have the vision of a sixth-former to thank, who had seen the band perform in the Cavern nightclub and approached the manager. This bold student, Dave Moores (who would go on to become the chairman of Liverpool FC), organised the concert himself, selling tickets at 5 shillings to cover the &pound;100 fee, without involving any schoolmasters. Bloomfield was stage manager and decided to run a tape with a microphone at the front of the stage.</p> <p>There is no denying the intense religious devotion that the band evoke in some fans. Within hours of breaking the story I had messages from several countries, some polite, but most with an edge of urgency, desperately keen to know what was on the set list.</p> <p>One astute reader queried anxiously about whether a photograph of the band at Stowe that night, used to illustrate a newspaper story about my find, had been flipped or mirrored &ndash; they were concerned that Paul and Ringo were holding pens in their wrong hands (Paul and Ringo are left-handed, although Ringo might have signed with his right).</p> <p>New threads to the story have emerged since then, through the people contacting me. One of the very few girls at the gig, a daughter of the couple who ran the tuck shop, got in touch on hearing my report. I connected her to Bloomfield, a boy she&rsquo;d not spoken to for 60 years.</p> <p>In <em>Yellow Submarine</em>, the old sea captain warns the band, &ldquo;If we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we&rsquo;ll all disappear up our own existence.&rdquo; But there is nothing introspective about this story. I was delighted to hear that Bloomfield plans to donate the tape to a public cultural institution. Far from adding to a private reliquary, it looks like the Stowe tape will continue to open up joyful stories for the future.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

The DUNE project will investigate the neutrino &ndash; the tiniest of fundamental particles, meaning &ldquo;the little neutral one&rdquo; in Italian. It is being constructed one mile deep below Sanford Lab in South Dakota.</p> <p>Neutrinos are so tiny that they barely interact with anything and simply glide straight through you, through the Earth and out the other side. But these particles have a mighty role to play in helping us understand some of the most fundamental questions in physics: What is the origin of matter and why is there an imbalance of matter and anti-matter? Is there a grand unifying theory that connects all forces? How do black holes form?</p> <p>More than 1,000 scientists and engineers, from 200 labs and universities across 30 countries, are collaborating to build DUNE in the hope it will reveal key information about this mysterious particle. The DUNE experiment starts with an underground particle accelerator, where particles will smash into a target to generate an intense beam of neutrinos that will travel through the ground towards the detectors. That&rsquo;s the easy part. The real challenge is in the design and construction of huge, highly complex detector systems that are capable of seeing a particle that doesn&rsquo;t want to be seen.</p> <p>Each of four detector modules will be a liquid-argon chamber filled with 17,000 tons of argon. Neutrinos colliding with argon atoms will produce charged particles that in turn knock out electrons that will be detected by 150 2.3m x 6m units of tightly-wound copper beryllium wires, thus providing a signal that can be recorded as neutrino data. And now the DUNE collaboration has announced the exciting news that mass production for this first, colossal detector module has started, after a series of successful prototype tests at CERN.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog.¬†</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,¬† psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book. ¬†Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport S√©ance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.¬† It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.¬† Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.‚Äù<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">¬†University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúReading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you‚Äôre in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world‚Äôs most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.‚Äù<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President,¬†</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúA fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn‚Äôt offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">¬†top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúThis wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.‚Äù<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">¬†Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
