            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">I love it when creationists decide to attack evolution by way of developmental biology. Yes, come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly. Our home is our terrible weakness, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be able to frolic and thrive in our little domain…heh heh heh &lt;twirls mustache&gt;</p>
<p>This fellow, <a href="https://evolutionunderthemicroscope.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">David W. Swift</a>, whose knowledge of development is maybe an inch deep and obtained entirely from information taken from basic textbooks, followed up by a conscious misreading of a few scientific papers with an eye to extracting only bits and pieces that support his conclusion, has decided that embryology is evidence against evolution.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>It is quite well known that at a relatively early stage the embryos of a wide range of vertebrates look similar – a so-called &#8216;phylotypic stage&#8217; – and this is generally regarded as evidence of common ancestry.</p>
<p>What is not well known is that before this stage the early embryonic development of vertebrates is very diverse – right from the earliest stages – which clearly refutes their common ancestry.</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s partly right. It is well known that there are embryonic similarites between vertebrates, and <em>of course</em> that&#8217;s evidence for common ancestry. There is a lot of evidence for common ancestry, and that <em>is</em> one small piece of it.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s wrong when he says that it is <q>not well known</q> that early development is more diverse. Any developmental biology textbook that discusses comparative embryology is going to tell you that. <em>We developmental biologists ALL know that</em>. It&#8217;s been a hot button topic of discussion for at least 50 years, probably longer. Mr Swift perused a select bunch of papers and just skipped over any that brought the topic up, so he could pretend he was the perceptive creationist who noticed, for the first time, a &#8216;weakness&#8217; in evolutionary theory? Such arrogance. It&#8217;s especially annoying because he says nothing novel that he couldn&#8217;t have found prominently discussed in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>Also, the known evidence that early development is a complex process with diverse patterns of execution in different organism does not refute common ancestry. The creationists seem unable to get into their heads that a short-sighted process driven by chance as a core mechanism, running over millions and billions of years, is going to generate complexity and diversity by its very nature. Observing that something is complex and diverse is evidence that an evolutionary process created it, rather than an engineer.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t stop him from expanding that claim into a <a href="https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2022.1/pdf">whole tedious paper, published in the Discovery Institute&#8217;s fake journal, Bio-Complexity</a>. The only difference between it and the short blurb on his website is the wordiness.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>It is well known that the embryonic development of vertebrates from different classes (e.g., fish, reptiles, mammals) pass through  a “phylotypic stage” when they look similar, and this apparent homology is widely seen as evidence of their common ancestry.  However, despite their morphological similarities, and contrary to evolutionary expectations, the phylotypic stages of different  vertebrate classes arise in radically diverse ways. This diversity clearly counters the superficial appearance of homology of the  phylotypic stage, and the plain inference is that vertebrates have not evolved from a common vertebrate ancestor. The diversity  extends through all stages of early development—including cleavage and formation of the blastula, gastrulation, neurulation, and  formation of the gut and extraembryonic membranes. This paper focuses on gastrulation, during which the germ layers originate  and the vertebrate body-plan begins to form. Despite its key role in embryonic development, gastrulation occurs in fundamentally  different ways in different classes of vertebrates. The inference against common ancestry becomes progressively stronger as more  is discovered about the genetic and molecular mechanisms that implement development. It is increasingly evident that these are  of such complexity that it is unrealistic to think that undirected variations (random mutations) could produce constructive changes  to development, such as those required to account for a diversification of development from that of a common ancestor, especially  while retaining a similar phylotypic stage.</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s focusing on gastrulation, which certainly is an interesting phenomenon. Gastrulation is a process by which animals form three embryonic layers from two, and there are multiple ways animals do it: by involution or a kind of folding/migration, or by delamination, or cells leaving a layer to reconstitute another one, and it&#8217;s also strongly affected by maternal investment. Animals that pack a lot of yolky goodies into their eggs have different patterns of cell division and movement than animals that produce small eggs with little yolk, so animal life history and ecology plays a significant role.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s nothing new. It&#8217;s not a significant obstacle to comprehending evolution as the origin of the diversity (again, evolution is really, really good at coming up with diverse solutions, and also complicated Rube-Goldbergian strategies). Somehow, all these really smart scientists have been looking at this problem for decades, and they haven&#8217;t been leaving the evolutionary camp in droves.</p>
<p>For example, Bill Ballard was writing about exactly these issues for a long, long time. He was talking about it when I was a grad student and earlier. He has all kinds of papers specifically discussing the diversity of gastrulation in vertebrates, and he was particularly peeved at people who assumed that embryological homology can be traced all the way back to the earliest stages of development. These were vestiges of an &#8220;antique homological theory&#8221;, he said, that is, Haeckel&#8217;s recapitulation theory, and everyone needed to get over it.</p>
<blockquote><p>It may be that the cells of representatives different classes of chordates or different phyla are behaving in such different microenvironments and being controlled by such different genes and forces that the analysis of their morphogenetic movements will be as difficult to compress into a single account as the description of their early embryonic stages has proved to be. It seems wise, in the meantime, to avoid assumptions of uniformity drawn not from precise observation but from antique homological theory. We should be cautious with the use of terms that have become more and more loaded with implied meaning while they were becoming less and less definable.</p></blockquote>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t reject evolution because of this complexity, though. He suggests that &#8220;it <strong>may</strong> be&#8221; that cells in different organisms may be &#8220;controlled by such different genes and forces that the analysis of their morphogenetic movements will be as difficult&#8221;. Maybe there isn&#8217;t a clean, simple, single principle driving gastrulation, but a whole welter of divergent processes that will be difficult to sort out. That is not contrary to evolution at all!</p>
<p>Also, he wrote that in 1976. That was before evo-devo appeared on the stage, and maybe there will be some comprehensible unified principles establishing a unity in gastrulation, once we start combining embryology and molecules (hint, hint).</p>
<p>David Swift, writing in 2022, has no such excuse. In fact, he&#8217;s going to cite several well-known evo-devo scientists while completely ignoring their explanations. The bulk of his paper consists of pulling out drawings of the gastrula stage of various organisms, and saying, &#8220;See? They look different, therefore evolution is false.&#8221; He&#8217;s so focused on superficial comparisons with no deeper understanding that he shoots himself in the foot without even noticing. Pay attention to the last sentence in his diatribe.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>In view of their morphological similarities, it is understandable that the phylotypic stages of different classes of vertebrates  were interpreted as homologous and as evidence of common  ancestry. However, this apparent homology is refuted by more  detailed embryological evidence; despite their similarities, the  phylotypic stages are formed embryonically in profoundly different ways. The straightforward conclusion to draw from this  radical diversity of their early embryonic development is that it  shows the vertebrates have not evolved from a common vertebrate ancestor. This conclusion can be avoided only if there are  credible explanations for how such diversity of early development might have arisen from the development prevailing in a  common ancestor (whether or not similar to present-day cephalochordates) in an evolutionary way, via changes that (i) had a  realistic probability of occurring, (ii) maintained viability, and  (iii) offered, in most cases, significant advantage that could be  favored by natural selection.  <strong>Further, to be taken seriously, such explanations can no  longer be based solely on putative morphological changes, but  must take account of what we now know about the genetic  and molecular mechanisms through which embryonic development is implemented.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Holy crap, YES. We have to look at the genetic and molecular mechanisms. So why doesn&#8217;t Swift talk about them at all? He has one throw-away image that he doesn&#8217;t discuss, and he quotes important scientists like Rudy Raff, but he doesn&#8217;t seem to understand what they say at all &#8212; or more maliciously, edits out anything they say contrary to his perspective.</p>
<p>For instance, he ends the paper by citing Raff.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>It is more than 20 years since Raff wrote: “One might reasonably expect mechanisms of early development to be especially resistant to modification because all subsequent development derives from early processes”, and the more we find out about how embryonic development is implemented at the genetic and molecular levels, the more it reinforces this commonsense conclusion. Many other authors have also commented on why we would expect early embryonic development to be resistant to change (for examples see Irie and Kuratani). Yet, when it comes to the diverse embryonic development of presumed homologous organs or body-plans, the usual assumption is that their early development must somehow have derived from that of a common ancestor, no matter how improbable the changes required, rather than accept the plain inference that the similar organs etc. are not homologous, at least not in an evolutionary sense. This expectation seems to reflect an ideological commitment to the theory of evolution rather than an objective assessment of the embryological facts.</p></blockquote>
<p>You know by now that when a creationist partially quotes something from a real biology paper, it&#8217;s worthwhile to look to see what they intentionally left out. Here&#8217;s that Raff paper.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/hourglass.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/hourglass-190x300.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-69488" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/hourglass-190x300.jpg 190w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/hourglass-95x150.jpg 95w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/hourglass.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px" /></a>One might reasonably expect mechanisms of early development  to be especially resistant to modification because all subsequent development  derives from early processes. Traditionally, features of early development and  conserved larval stages, even between phyla, have been regarded as strong  homologous characters for the inference of phylogeny. The division of animals  into protostome and deuterostome superphyla is based on the ideas that  embryonic similarities are homologous and have been largely immutable over  hundreds of millions of years (Raff 1996).  A view of development from an evolutionary perspective is both more  confounding and more interesting. Early development is highly evolvable, even  among closely related species. The evolutionary portrait of ontogeny may be that  of an hourglass, as shown in Fig. 1. In this diagram, embryos of two related species  follow different early developmental trajectories, but converge on a similar  phylotypic stage. It is important to note that the phylotypic stages of related  organisms bear major features in common, but also have evolved significantly  (Richardson et a1 1998). Divergence in post-phylotypic developmental  trajectories yields variant adult species morphologies, as suggested by von Baer.  The divergence of pre-phylotypic stage pathways can be extreme. For example,  polyembryonic parasitic wasps have a bizarre early developmental pathway that  does not resemble typical insect early development. Polyembryonic development  produces 2000 embryos from one egg. Nonetheless, these secondary embryos  develop via a characteristic insect phylotypic stage (Grbic et a1 1998)</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess he only read the first sentence, because the rest of the paragraph is pointing out the value of the evolutionary perspective. He also mentions the developmental hourglass, which Swift includes in his paper, which Swift fails to point out is <em>not</em> a creationist revelation, but a routine illustration of the phenomenon of early divergence which <em>every goddamn developmental biologist knows about</em>.</p>
<p>Raff also goes on to explain why this does not refute evolution.</p>
<blockquote><p>With respect to  Van Valen’s view that homologues represent a continuity of information, we find  that some of the processes that underlie the evolution of development can  confound what we mean by ‘continuity’ as well. Should all this be a cause for  despair? No. Biologists have historically used homologies to trace evolutionary  histories and phylogenetic relationships. A deeper understanding reveals that this  cannot be a tidy programme. That is on the face of it unfortunate, and has generated  much hand wringing on the usefulness of the homology concept. However, where  developmental homologies are difficult to identify because of process shifts in  ontogeny, we are actually being told interesting things about evolution.  Ambiguities in development of homologues in embryos reveal where and how  evolutionary changes occur and thus, although confounding, are difficult Rosetta  Stones needed to understand how evolutionary novelties arise</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s the same point Ballard was making! The complications are interesting, they are informative about the evolution of the process, we shouldn&#8217;t expect a tidy, simple program of development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of the cool ideas that emerged from evo-devo is the observation that hey, different organisms are using the <em>same molecules</em> in early developmental processes, like gastrulation. Swift makes the error of talking about the epithelial-to-mesenchyme (EMT) transition, a common process in which cells leave their tidy sheet (epithelium) to migrate as loosely aggregated mesenchyme to new destinations. It occurs in all kinds of developmental processes, as well as in cancer. Here&#8217;s all he says about it.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Behind the above changes that occur at the cellular level are<br />
of course the genetic and other molecular mechanisms that effect these changes. Progress has been made towards elucidating these, and some are depicted in Figure 18.<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/emt.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/emt-500x480.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="480" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-69487" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/emt.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/emt-150x144.jpg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/emt-300x288.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a strange self-own. He finally mentions molecules, and shows an image that lists a bunch of molecules, and I looked at it and was confused. Not because I didn&#8217;t understand it &#8212; those are all molecules I know very well &#8212; but because the diagram was ambiguous. What is this? Human cancer tissue, or a fruit fly embryo? Because it applies equally to all of them. Wnt/Frizzled (he misspelled it!), Delta/Notch, etc.…these are old friends. You can find them if flies and zebrafish and people. Read the Debnath paper Swift took it from, and as it goes through the molecules, it&#8217;s repeatedly saying things like &#8220;Snail was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster,&#8221; &#8220;Twist1 was first identified in drosophila,&#8221; &#8220;ortholog of human GATA6 acts as inducer of EMT in Drosophila endoderm,&#8221; etc., you mean Swift didn&#8217;t notice that we have molecular homologs of all these genes central to gastrulation that are present in multiple phyla? Curious blindspot he&#8217;s got there.</p>
<p>If you are seriously and honestly reading the developmental biology literature, as Swift is not, you can&#8217;t avoid this. It&#8217;s everywhere. Developmental biologists are taking these processes apart using the tools of molecular biology, and practically every paper acknowledges the way every organism is using the <em>same molecules</em> (and also ackowledging differences!) to carry out what may look like different cellular events. Nobody is shy about pointing this out, so it takes a kind of willful ignorance to overlook it. Here, for example, I pulled out a paper I&#8217;ve been reading about polarized shapes in epithelia. Notice the conclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>The recent demonstration that a similar, or even the  same, Fz/PCP signaling pathway regulates both  polarized cell shape changes in flies and CE in  vertebrates suggests that this is an evolutionarily  conserved mechanism. Strikingly, the conservation  extends beyond the core Fz/Dsh signaling module in  PCP and includes vertebrate homologs of other genes  involved in Drosophila PCP [40–43].  Thus, although the end result of cellular  polarization is distinct in different tissues and  organisms, the underlying signaling pathways and  mechanisms seem to be highly conserved. First,  specific aspects of Fz/PCP signaling and their  interaction with other PCP genes are likely to be  similar between flies and vertebrates. Second, specific  Fz/PCP-regulated processes such as activation of  Rho, Rho kinase, myosin and JNK seem to be features  that are shared between Drosophila and vertebrates.  Taken together, therefore, there is growing evidence  for the conserved function of Fz/PCP signaling and  the conserved involvement of other primary genes in  both epithelial PCP in flies and vertebrates, and in  CE in vertebrates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Swift is ridiculously stupid, lacking any real knowledge of the subject he&#8217;s writing about, yet it still manages to get published in an intelligent design creationism &#8220;journal&#8221;. They have no standards at all.</p>

She enquired into people&rsquo;s health and asked how she could be of assistance. One day, she decided to ask an extra question: &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; She noticed that several women didn&rsquo;t even reply. Patil was haunted by their blank stares and silence. What made them feel so low? When she returned soon after, she encouraged these women to speak and spent hours listening to their stories. She discovered they were widows who had been harshly ostracised by their communities.</p> <p>There are more than 55 million widows living in India today. While dealing with the grief and financial loss often caused by losing their husbands, many of these women are pressured into conforming to traditions that have been described as &ldquo;social death&rdquo;. Excluded from festivals and celebrations, many are expected to stay in their homes for a year or longer after the death. These restrictions are accompanied by stigma. In some remote villages, widows are expelled from the community and sent to shelter homes.</p> <p>&ldquo;None of these rituals make any sense,&rdquo; says Patil. But in several parts of India, a woman&rsquo;s identity is still tied to that of her husband. &ldquo;This tradition goes back several centuries and the reason it&rsquo;s followed even today is to curb women&rsquo;s freedom and put restrictions on them.&rdquo; If a widow fails to follow these rituals, she is shamed. People may even accuse her of never having loved her husband.</p> <p>Patil was familiar with these customs, but still she was shocked by the women&rsquo;s stories. &ldquo;It left me numb,&rdquo; she says. One woman was a fellow healthcare worker, Lalita Mudshinge. She was in her early 30s when her husband, a tractor driver, died of a heart attack in 2017. Immediately, she was asked to break her bangles, remove the necklace and vermillion mark associated with married women, and refrain from wearing colourful clothes. Furthermore, she was forbidden from participating in weddings, child naming ceremonies and other celebrations.</p> <p>Mudshinge was prepared for this ostracisation. She also anticipated being blamed for her husband&rsquo;s death, as many widows are. &ldquo;I kept all the medical records safely and even the autopsy report,&rdquo; she says. But despite the evidence that he had died of cardiac arrest, she was still accused by her in-laws and members of the community of playing a part. They also wanted to force her to stay in the house for a year. This was not possible, as Mudshinge, like Patil, worked as a community healthcare worker, which meant regular trips into the centre of the village.</p> <p>&ldquo;The men from the village would stalk me in the streets and make bad comments,&rdquo; she said. The abuse reached a stage where even stepping out of her front door began to feel dangerous. &ldquo;I was so stressed and scared that I often fell ill,&rdquo; she says. The social stigma directly impacted her work, with senior staff yelling at her constantly. &ldquo;Mudshinge was suicidal, depressed, and on the verge of leaving her job,&rdquo; Patil says. However, within a few years, she was helping her fellow widows and battling patriarchal attitudes in her country. How did it happen?</p> <h2>The fight back begins</h2> <p>It all started with that extra question, &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; This simple invitation to speak progressed into hours of conversation, as Mudshinge was finally able to explain her plight. Patil gave Mudshinge her contact details and said to reach out at any time. She also started visiting the woman&rsquo;s home and tried to persuade her in-laws to stop practising the widowhood rituals.</p> <p>Initially, they were not convinced. So, Patil increased the visits. After a few months, Mudshinge began noticing a change. Her in-laws were more accepting of her leaving the house, and even allowed her to wear jewellery and colourful clothes. Men from the community continued to harass her when she did her rounds as a healthcare worker, but after Patil began accompanying her, she found she was more able to face them down.</p> <p>Patil was helping five other widows at the time. They were all coping with challenges, and she felt they were not being adequately supported. So she reached out to a fellow healthcare worker in a nearby village. Together, they began to organise awareness sessions for widows.</p> <p>These healthcare workers understand the plight of widows because they are all women and come from rural communities themselves. They are Accredited Social Health Activists, or ASHA workers. There are over a million ASHAs in India: roughly one for every 1,000 people. They are all female and come from the communities they serve. They do everything from prenatal care to administering vaccines, providing medicines for common ailments and maintaining health records for every community member. <br>Patil started to team up with more ASHA workers, reasoning that widowhood was a serious public health matter and should be treated as such. At first, nobody came to the awareness sessions. They had to squeeze in talking to the widows during routine community visits. Finally, after around six months of this work, with remote counselling done by phone, a few women started showing up to the sessions. &ldquo;It was so powerful,&rdquo; Mudshinge says. &ldquo;It helped me muster the courage to face the stigma.&rdquo;</p> <p>There was still a long way to go, however, when it came to acceptance from the community. That&rsquo;s when Patil came up with a unique idea. She invited all the widows from the nearby villages and asked a local government official to join them for a special event. Patil asked the official to celebrate the widows for their heroism in battling the oppressive widowhood rituals. The official agreed. It was a bold move. News spread in the villages and beyond, and the event was covered by the regional media.</p> <p>Mudshinge printed the photos and kept them in her wallet. &ldquo;From then on, whenever someone abused me, I showed them these photos, and it helped me,&rdquo; she said. She would never have guessed that a photo could change her life. The event expanded into a series, hosted by several villages in Maharashtra. At each event, widows were celebrated and encouraged to break with the rituals and practices that had brought so much suffering into their lives.</p> <p>Around the same time, social activist Pramod Zinjade started a movement asking village heads in Maharashtra to pass a resolution to ban the widowhood rituals outright. In May last year, Herwad became the first village to do so. The state government asked all villages to follow suit, and reportedly 7,500 villages have passed resolutions seeking to curb the practices. However, there are no legal ramifications if these resolutions are not followed through, so it&rsquo;s difficult to say how effective they will be.</p> <h2>Just the beginning</h2> <p>Changing local and state policy is important. But the work doesn&rsquo;t end there. As lawyer and activist Amol Naik says, &ldquo;Implementation is the key.&rdquo; Naik has spent over a decade fighting to protect and uphold the rights of women farmers and agricultural labourers, many of whom suffer greatly if they are faced with widowhood. He points out that widows do have legal rights under Indian law &ndash; such as the right to inherit their husband&rsquo;s property &ndash; but often feel unable to assert these rights. &ldquo;Younger widows are ostracised and made to feel that their relatives are doing them a favour by letting them stay [in their own homes]. Eventually, they stop asking.&rdquo;</p> <p>Akkatai Teli is an activist who has spent four decades working with widows and bringing the perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence to justice. She says that many widows aren&rsquo;t aware of their legal rights and there can often be a vested interest in not telling them. &ldquo;Most of them are denied a share in the property and kicked out of the house because the in-laws fear they will ascertain their rights,&rdquo; she says. Many of these women end up in shelter homes. The problem is so severe that in 2018, the government built a shelter home in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, that can accommodate 1,000 widows.</p> <p>Patil, meanwhile, has continued to work on the root cause of widows&rsquo; problems. Between 2017 and 2022 she trained a team of 20 women, most of whom are widows themselves, to help combat regressive customs. So far, the network has helped hundreds of widows from over 20 villages in Maharashtra. Her attempts are now being formalised into a full-time support system at the village, district and state levels.</p> <p>Patil&rsquo;s goal is not just to help these women heal, but to ensure they can live a life of dignity. This involves practical support; ensuring the widows have the correct paperwork to access government welfare, training them to become self-reliant and helping them start their own businesses. She also helps them access mental health treatment. &ldquo;Telling their stories can be triggering for the women,&rdquo; she says, so they have learned to be careful in their work.</p> <p>But there is another challenge. As an ASHA, Patil isn&rsquo;t paid for her work with the widows, nor is she trained to provide counselling. &ldquo;The health department doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge our work,&rdquo; she says. The work with widows is classed as voluntary. She says that ASHAs aren&rsquo;t paid enough in any case, and could achieve much more with adequate compensation.</p> <p>While the exact figures vary across states, they are uniformly low. In Maharashtra, ASHAs earn an average of 3,500-5,000 Indian Rupees (&pound;34-50) per month. They are paid per task &ndash; for example, for providing antenatal or postnatal care and overseeing a pregnancy in a public hospital, they earn &pound;4.90. &ldquo;ASHAs are a support system for millions of people,&rdquo; Patil points out. &ldquo;If the government starts paying us adequately and on time, many [more] ASHAs can help women recover from their trauma.&rdquo;</p> <h2>A turning point</h2> <p>Ongoing support is important, as even if the lives of widows improve, they still have to recover from the abuse and ostracisation. When Anjali Pehelwan, 39, lost her husband to Covid, her relatives weren&rsquo;t concerned about her grief. &ldquo;All they wanted was to forcefully take away my jewellery and toe rings,&rdquo; she remembers. Although Pehelwan resisted, a few women pulled off her jewellery, bruising and cutting her. The cuts healed in a week, she says, but it took a year before she recovered from the mental trauma.</p> <p>Luckily, Pehelwan was able to access support. She was put in touch with Maya Patil, the ASHA worker who had helped Netradipa organise the very first awareness sessions for widows. (Netradipa and Maya share a last name but are not related.) Maya Patil started counselling Pehelwan on the phone and in person. Gradually, Pehelwan started wearing her jewellery again, began to leave the house, and started asking people to treat her as an equal to other women. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. &ldquo;The community members were so aghast that they started calling me ill-omened and a witch,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>Then, in April 2022, Maya Patil came up with the idea of celebrating Gudi Padwa (Maharashtra&rsquo;s new year), considered to be the most auspicious occasion in the Hindu calendar. &ldquo;Traditionally, while a widow is allowed to celebrate this occasion, they are barred from performing any rituals,&rdquo; Pehelwan explains. Maya Patil was determined to change this. She called a group of 20 women together, including Pehelwan and another widow. &ldquo;I started talking about the discriminatory practices and why we should raise our voice,&rdquo; she says. At first, the other women stepped away from the widows, but Patil wouldn&rsquo;t give up. She convinced them to celebrate the new year festival together, with Pehelwan taking the lead.</p> <p>There was a backlash from certain members of the community. People spread a rumour that Pehelwan was celebrating the festival because she had remarried. (Widows in India are allowed to remarry, but in reality they are often ostracised if they do.) A scandal was brewing, but fortunately the local journalists reported the event accurately, confirming that Pehelwan was still single. &ldquo;That was the best time to shut down all such conspiracy theories,&rdquo; she recalls, laughing at the memory.</p> <p>Later, Pehelwan discovered that there were 450 widows and separated women in her village of Arjunwad alone. &ldquo;We need to stop using the word &lsquo;widow&rsquo; and come up with better words,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;&lsquo;Widow&rsquo; is never a woman&rsquo;s identity. It&rsquo;s no fault of hers that her husband has died.&rdquo; She found that many women wanted to oppose the rituals, but didn&rsquo;t speak up because of the patriarchal system. &ldquo;My goal is to help them voice their concerns.&rdquo;</p> <p>Pehelwan works long hours as a data entry operator. But although her work is tiring, she spends her evenings taking phone calls from other widows, encouraging them to leave the house and assert their rights. &ldquo;People think it&rsquo;s a burden, but it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Whenever I see a woman healing, I feel I have given someone a new life. While this can never make up for my loss, I am proud to help bring an end to the trauma of other women.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Spider webs, especially cobwebs, are so complex that it can get annoying. They&#8217;re also hard to photograph &#8212; so many thin threads going every which-way in 3 dimensions, it&#8217;s easy to get lost. I&#8217;ve been gratified lately to find that I can confine spiders to make mostly two-dimensional sheets using a wooden frame in a plastic container (they prefer natural substrates), but I have no illusion that this reflects the sophistication of their natural behavior. It&#8217;s mainly a good way to get them to pose nicely for me, and to simplify moving them from one place to another.</p>
<p>But some people <a href="https://studiotomassaraceno.org/hybrid-webs/">manage to capture those 3-D webs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/cobweb.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/cobweb-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-69484" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/cobweb-500x333.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/cobweb-150x100.jpg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/cobweb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/03/cobweb-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Forget about spider man and his meek two-dimensional webs! Even though spider webs have been around for at least 140 million years, we have never managed to preserve, measure and display their webs in a three dimensional form. Tomás Saraceno has opened our eyes to the intricate geometry of spider webs with his newly invented scanning instrument that digitized for the first time a three-dimensional web. In fact, there is no single museum in the world with a collection of this kind. His spider web sculptures are a breakthrough in both science and art, and thanks to his methods and technique he has enabled much needed comparative studies in mathematics, engineering and arachnology, opening new fields of studies.”</p>

<p>There are lots of pretty pictures at that link. Everybody loves orb webs, but cobwebs are much more intricate and confusing.</p>

<p class="lead">I was living in Philadelphia during the OJ Simpson trial, and every day on my commute I&#8217;d pick up a copy of the Daily News, the city&#8217;s tabloid paper, and it was pretty much non-stop OJ coverage. It was weirdly fascinating, since OJ was that terrible combination of rich, famous, and obviously guilty. The trial was a prolonged spectacle of justice twisted to support a joyful media that knew a cash cow when they saw it, and a team of showboating lawyers who were more about putting on a show than practicing law. And then OJ was acquitted! The rich guy got off (although that was complicated by the fact that it was the rich <em>black</em> guy who escaped justice &#8212; there were a lot of people cheering for him, too.)</p>
<p>The latest law event comparable was the Alex Murdaugh trial. It was inescapable! It was unbelievable! It was a string of crimes where the culprit was clearly the corrupt Southern lawyer who seemed to think he could distract the law as it came crashing down on him by committing yet another clumsily executed murder, butchering his own family members. He was so obviously guilty that every death of everyone with any connection to the family began to look like another victim of a Murdaugh conspiracy.</p>
<p>I am so cynical that as the evidence piled up, I was convinced that Murdaugh was also going to be acquitted. The more damning the evidence became, the more certain I was that he was going to walk, because justice in America is synonymous with money. I was surprised when the jury adjurned and came back with a guilty verdict in only 45 minutes!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/03/06/the-alex-murdaugh-verdict-matters-no-shame-in-being-fascinated-by-this-true/">Amanda Marcotte has been reading my mind all this time</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ah yes, why would cable news fixate on this truly bonkerballs string of crimes — corruption, fraud, drug abuse, and of course, murder — that would put any Southern gothic novel to shame? It hardly seems a mystery, especially when it seems that time spent not on this murder is instead dedicated to endless speculation about presidential primaries that are a year away and already have painfully predictable outcomes. (It&#8217;s Donald Trump and Joe Biden again, folks. Sorry to spoil the surprise.) And it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re going to suddenly start having fruitful discussions on policy that will no doubt invite viewers to turn the channel. </p>
<p>Accusations of frivolity are something true crime fans have had to deal with for roughly forever. It&#8217;s a charge that has more than an air of sexism to it, as most such enthusiasts are women. But the Murdaugh case thoroughly exposes how wrong the &#8220;crime stories don&#8217;t matter&#8221; talking point is. The case cuts straight to the heart of so much of what is driving our current social-political climate, and in a more insightful way than most of the content the Beltway press is producing. (Oh boy, another interview with weaselly Trump voters in diners!) We&#8217;re in the midst of what is likely a decade, if not longer, of <strong>American crisis over exactly how much impunity we&#8217;ve allowed white men, especially those with money</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve adopted a bleak mindset in which I&#8217;m helpless as rotten, stupid, <em>rich</em> men are going to trample all over the country with impunity. We can think of a few, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<blockquote><p>Donald Trump attempted a coup that led to a violent insurrection and he is not in prison yet. (And may be president again!) Social media owners like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are profiting off the destruction of democracy, and there seems to be no check on their power. Sure, Harvey Weinstein finally went to prison, but the powers that protect pampered white men have come roaring back, shielding other accused abusers like Johnny Depp and Kevin Spacey from consequences. Endless whining about &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; and &#8220;wokeness&#8221; is the battle cry of white male privilege — they will never fold to the forces demanding accountability! </p>
<p>The Murdaugh family story resonates because it&#8217;s so in tune with these societal concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m still in disbelief that Trump is <em>campaigning for president</em> right now. The most corrupt and incompetent president in my lifetime, and he gets a free pass because he&#8217;s rich.</p>
<p>There are more.</p>
<blockquote><p>Clearly, however, Murdaugh and his lawyer hoped he could bullshit his way out of this situation. It wasn&#8217;t a baseless belief. Murdaugh has a long history of evading justice that suggests he could pull it off. So it wasn&#8217;t hard to draw the connection between Murdaugh and the endless stream of glib rich white guy liars we&#8217;re subjected to on a daily basis: Trump. Tucker Carlson. Steve Bannon. Ben Shapiro. Ron DeSantis. I could go on forever. Men are always pissing on our legs and telling us it&#8217;s raining. We&#8217;re drowning in it. </p></blockquote>
<p>What the Alex Murdaugh conviction tells us, though, is that there&#8217;s hope. Maybe, sometimes, we&#8217;ll see the wealthy and their puppets get their comeuppance.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Robert Pirsig's 1974 bestseller continues to serve as a gospel for long-distance bikers" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/iswanto-arif-m1nHYuMvBAI-unsplash-small.jpg" height="1448" alt="A man on a motorbike in the mountains" width="1448"></p> <p>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, published in 1974, was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon. A work of fictionalised autobiography, the book follows its author Robert Pirsig on a long motorcycle ride through the US, from Minnesota across the prairie to Oregon, then down to southern California. The muscles of that skeletal journey are Pirsig&rsquo;s philosophical musings on the notion of Quality. Pirsig created the concept in order explain the relationship between human values and societal values.</p> <p>At once both obvious and ephemeral, Quality escapes easy definition. (And brings to mind American supreme court justice Potter Stewart&rsquo;s comments about pornography: &ldquo;I know it when I see it.&rdquo;) In his original formulation, Pirsig describes it, not a little paradoxically, as &ldquo;a characteristic of thought and statement that is recognised by a non-thinking or intuitive process.&rdquo; At another juncture, Quality is defined as the event which occurs between the observer and the observed. Pirsig&rsquo;s search for clarity stretched his mind to the breaking point, ultimately landing him in a psychiatric facility where he was subjected to electroshock therapy.</p> <p>And yet, the concept has been influential. The book, a bestseller, continues to be read by motorcyclists, philosophers and everyone in between. This year, a long-awaited collection of writings has been published for the first time, giving us a deeper look at how Pirsig shaped his concept. Edited by Pirsig&rsquo;s widow Wendy, an archivist and Pirsig&rsquo;s frequent collaborator, On Quality uses outtakes from unpublished letters and lectures, and from Pirsig&rsquo;s two books (Zen and 1991&rsquo;s Lila). It is an intimate and highly selective look at his journey through the work of the early Greek philosophers, Asiatic mysticism and beyond.</p> <p>Again and again, he approaches the concept from different angles, employing simile, analogy and deductive reasoning. Often, he only tightens the knot he has created. But there are moments of brilliance. In a letter written in 1995, Pirsig outlined where he saw Quality fitting among the pantheon of religious philosophy, placing it beside Hinduism&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oneness&rdquo; Buddhism&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nothingness&rdquo; and the monotheist&rsquo;s &ldquo;God&rdquo; as a fourth path leading up &ldquo;the mountain of understanding&rdquo;. Optimistically, he singles out Quality as the one that cannot be dismissed by the &ldquo;scientifically minded&rdquo; as &ldquo;meaningless, metaphysical claptrap&rdquo;.</p> <p>Quality then, is a kind of religion, though one preaching improvement for its own sake, rather than in the service of some deity. It is less concerned with eternal life than with the pursuit of truth and beauty. Much of its appeal lies in Pirsig&rsquo;s prose, which combines his repetitive, mantra-like style with a pragmatic, matter-of-fact charm. The book is illustrated with photos of his collection of tools &ndash; spanners, drills, pliers and the like &ndash; a reminder that this was a philosopher with dirt under his fingernails.</p> <h2>The goal of truth</h2> <p>I first read Pirsig in 2012, while preparing for my own long motorcycle journey, from the Canadian prairie to the Argentinian Pampa. It strikes me now as a voyage from one cattle country to another, though at that time it was too sinuous and ill-planned to be so clearly defined. I had none of Pirsig&rsquo;s discipline, but like him, I struggled to find meaning in what I was pursuing. Was I travelling as catharsis? For freedom? For evasion? Adventure seemed the most likely reason, but I was too often alone and inconsolable to convince myself of that pursuit.</p> <p>If Quality is the quasi-religion of what Pirsig called the &ldquo;Church of Reason&rdquo;, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is its holy book. I wasn&rsquo;t the only one to treat it as such. Motorcyclists I met on that trip, and have met since, talk about Zen as a kind of compendium for life. Like most adherents, there was among them more enthusiasm (which means, as Pirsig points out, &ldquo;filled with theos&rdquo;, or God) for Pirsig than drive for understanding.</p> <p>When Zen was first published, motorcycle travel literature was not yet the identifiable genre it is today. That variety of travelogue began in earnest in 1979 with the appearance of Ted Simon&rsquo;s Jupiter&rsquo;s Travels, the story of a five-year round-the-world odyssey between 1973 and 1977. If Pirsig was a kind of modern Homer, Simon was like Virgil: pagan and worldly, inured in scholarship of prose, yet beset with laurels of deism. &ldquo;Of all the gods in the pantheon,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;Jupiter is the one I fancy most. A lovely name, Jupiter, like cream and honey in the mouth. And a sense of great distance and closeness at the same time.&rdquo;</p> <p>Compare that to Pirsig, who wrote in Zen that &ldquo;The primary goal of the Church of Reason... is always Socrates&rsquo; old goal of truth, in its ever-changing forms, as it&rsquo;s revealed by the process of rationality.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s easy to see why motorcyclists might choose the path of Simon&rsquo;s self-aggrandisement over Pirsig&rsquo;s &ldquo;goal of truth&rdquo;. There was always the temptation to play at being god. While my own pan-American odyssey was underway, I came to recognise a particular mindset in fellow riders: an air of being separate in space and time, of being out of reality and untouchable. There were plenty of vengeful Odins and chaotic brothers of Mars riding into town with conquering on their minds. My own choice of god at the time was the callous and boozy Dionysus.</p> <p>Unambiguously foreign, strangely dressed, noisy, incorrigible, we rode our machines across the world as though it were the plains of Troy. We were given beds, food and love &ndash; offerings we accepted as tributes for our appearance on the battlefield. When we left, it was not uncommon for crowds of people to appear to see us off. The effect was inebriating, nectar for the ego. Today, those events put me in mind of Patrick Kavanagh&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Epic&rdquo;, which ends with the lines: &ldquo;Till Homer&rsquo;s ghost came whispering to my mind. / He said: I made the Iliad from such / A local row. Gods make their own importance.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Wreaking havoc</h2> <p>But therein lies the trouble with gods &ndash; they do not go out into the world to learn, but to teach, to wreak havoc, have their way with mortals; they live in the world as they want it, rather than as it is. Passing through one country after another, often without our &ldquo;required&rdquo; documents, and with the freedom of our vehicles, we felt that we had passed beyond the rules of society. I rode all over the Americas illegally, my expired paperwork needing only a few flicks of my pen to change the date.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand why travelers feel out of step with the world around them. Society is largely based on repetition and reliability, neither of which travel provides. But enough time ignoring the rules and a detached superiority begins to settle in. And then, the worst: bored with the thrills offered by the natural world, by spontaneity, by socialising, such riders turn from life to arithmetic: tallying up miles ridden, countries entered, tyres blown, meals eaten. Quantity becomes synonymous with merit, and the most venerable are those who have &ldquo;done more&rdquo;. As the urge to quantify rises, Quality suffers.</p> <p>Simon ends Jupiter&rsquo;s Travels with this reflection: &ldquo;Often I dream of riding over the hard red floor of a great forest, beneath a high canopy of translucent green, spreading on and on. An enchanted forest, perhaps, where men may still sometimes play at being gods.&rdquo; Pirsig ends Zen in a very different manner, by saying that &ldquo;to understand Quality, he would have to leave the mythos.&rdquo; It continues: &ldquo;[he] emerges as if from a dream, seeing that his whole consciousness, the mythos, has been a dream and no one&rsquo;s dream but his own, a dream he must now sustain of his own efforts.&rdquo;</p> <p>There is much to admire in motorcycle writing, but too much of it today is a poor imitation of the genre&rsquo;s forefathers. We will not produce another writer like Robert Pirsig until we can differentiate quantity from Quality. And we have to stop playing at being gods.</p> <p><em><span class="Apple-converted-space">This article is a preview from our New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here.</a></span></em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ageofstrongman.jpg" height="697" alt="The Age of the Strongman by Gideon Rachman" width="462"></em></p> <p><strong><br>The Age of the Strongman</strong> (Bodley Head) by Gideon Rachman</p> <p>The rivalry between democracy and autocracy promises to define much of this century. The Age of the Strongman by the Financial Times&rsquo; chief foreign affairs commentator Gideon Rachman attempts to explain how we got here. The central thrust is that, since the 1990s, the rise of a certain type of leader has become the key feature of &ldquo;the most sustained global assault on liberal democracy since the 1930s&rdquo;. By profiling 14 current-day leaders with authoritarian tendencies &ndash; from central Europe to South America to the Philippines &ndash; Rachman hopes to provide &ldquo;political liberals&rdquo; with an &ldquo;understanding of what they are dealing with&rdquo;.<br><br>Rachman begins with an outline of the &ldquo;playbook&rdquo; that has propelled strongmen into power. A common tactic is populist nationalism, which paints the strongman as a national saviour, pitting an ethnically and/or religiously defined nation against outside threats such as minority groups, migrants or a shadowy elite. In power, the erosion of civil liberties is a natural consequence. Rachman reminds us how strongmen have subjugated ethnic and religious communities in their countries. Whilst China&rsquo;s Xi detains Uyghurs in &ldquo;re-education&rdquo; camps, Narendra Modi has effectively stripped millions of Muslims of their Indian citizenship. Independent institutions and organisations are neutered. While some strongmen, like Viktor Orb&aacute;n, are known for hollowing out their country&rsquo;s independent media, others, like Vladimir Putin, preside over countries where journalists regularly turn up dead.<br><br>Rachman refuses to explain the rise of this authoritarianism through the talents of strongmen alone, nor does he assert that certain countries are predisposed to this rule. Chapters on Boris Johnson and Donald Trump dispel the myth that the west is impervious to democratic decline. Instead, Rachman argues that the success of strongmen is a &ldquo;symptom of the crisis of liberalism&rdquo;, which has economic, political and diplomatic dimensions.<br><br>Driving this crisis, according to Rachman, is an &ldquo;overconfidence in the power of liberal ideas born from &lsquo;victory&rsquo; in the Cold War&rdquo;. This prevented politicians and commentators from judging the true character of strongmen early in their careers. Rachman includes himself in this, going so far as to quote from one of his past articles that celebrated Modi&rsquo;s &ldquo;thrilling&rdquo; rise. The free market&rsquo;s most ardent defenders have since had to reckon with the compatibility of the system with authoritarianism.<br><br>But despite beginning what promises to be a meaningful critique of the liberal world order, Rachman never quite gets down to it. Instead, he regresses into clich&eacute;. His acknowledgement of the ills of globalisation is descriptive at best. The term &ldquo;neoliberalism&rdquo; is dismissed as an invention of the populist left, as if it wasn&rsquo;t the object of serious academic enquiry. Meanwhile, strongman critiques of the liberal world order go unexplored. Grievances against US foreign policy, Nato and the EU &ndash; some of which may be justified &ndash; are dismissed. It is unclear what Rachman has learnt from reckoning with post-Cold War politics.<br><br>This reversion to type is finalised in the book&rsquo;s conclusion, where the strongman is dismissed as a short-lived fad, and we are told to trust the US to lead a new &ldquo;human-rights based world order&rdquo;. Rachman fails to take seriously the US&rsquo; vulnerability to a Trump-like resurgence, or the grisly legacy of its foreign intervention since the Second World War. In the end, his pages are haunted by the same liberal overconfidence he finds complicit in the rise of the strongman. To strengthen liberalism against rising authoritarianism requires tougher questions of its historical record; perhaps even a consideration about the case for reinvention, something Rachman firmly rules out.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Mass graves in Izium, Ukraine" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2K1D0CX.jpg" height="667" alt="Mass graves in Izium, Ukraine." width="1000"></p> <p class="p1">It was a beautiful, fresh October day in the pine forest near Izium, eastern Ukraine, when I walked among the empty graves, avoiding the discarded plastic gowns and gloves &ndash; the Russian army trash. The sandy ground, once a place for picnics, was marred by gaping holes, splintered coffins, makeshift markers and spooled police tape. 447 people had been exhumed here.</p> <p class="p3">Ahead and behind me, Ukrainian writers &ndash; from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and elsewhere &ndash; also lost for words, were moving slowly through the carnage. They had come, a <br>busload of them, to the recently liberated areas east of Kharkiv, looking for news of their colleague Volodymyr Vakulenko. Looking for grave 319, and hoping that the rumours were true, that he was never there.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;He was a very special man,&rdquo; his friend Maksym Bespalov told me, then immediately corrected himself. &ldquo;He is a very special man. Idealistic.&rdquo; They&rsquo;d met more than a decade ago &ndash; Volodymyr was hugely active in the literary scene, publishing almanacs and magazines, getting published himself and winning awards for his books and poetry, organising festivals and encouraging younger writers. He turned to children&rsquo;s books after the birth of his son. Maksym tells me Volodymyr &ldquo;tries to be everywhere, involved in everything. A little bit crazy, perhaps. But we like him because he is him.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">What are his ideals, I asked Maksym. Without hesitation, he replied: &ldquo;For all of the good versus all of the bad&rdquo;. Volodymyr was an idealist; an outspoken, strident patriot who didn&rsquo;t just write about the Ukrainian struggle but put himself on the line during the revolution of 2014.</p> <p class="p3">Those who loved and admired Volodymyr &ndash; and there are many &ndash; had hopes he was in a Russian prison, awaiting trial. &ldquo;We all understand the most truthful version is that he is dead,&rdquo; Maksym said bluntly. &ldquo;But when we speak about Volodya, we always say that we hope he&rsquo;s still alive.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">It was a hope shared by Olena Ihnatenko, the writer&rsquo;s mother. Our next stop, once we&rsquo;d made it through half-destroyed Izium and down cratered roads to the village of Kapytolivka, was Olena&rsquo;s flat. She lives with her husband Vasyl and, now, Volodymyr&rsquo;s son Vitalik, who has autism and cannot speak. Volodymyr had hoped that the fact he was Vitalik&rsquo;s sole guardian would mean the soldiers would leave him alone. He was wrong.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Abducting a civilian</span></h2> <p class="p3">We all crammed into the flat and sat on the floor around Olena and Vasyl, like schoolchildren being told a story. They described the bombardment, the month in a cellar, the freezing cold and near-starvation. Then the troops arriving in the bombers&rsquo; wake. Volodymyr, who had been living with Vitalik and his own father elsewhere in the village, apparently ran out when the soldiers came, and shouted, &ldquo;The rashists are here!&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;Rashist&rdquo; is a neat portmanteau of Russian, racist and fascist that provokes ire in Russian soldiers: it expresses the widely-held Ukrainian view that Russians are now little different to Hitler&rsquo;s forces, which also invaded at 4am, 81 years earlier. It was in keeping with Volodymyr&rsquo;s stubborn, proud and undaunted character that he would shout this as the invaders arrived. It was also incredibly dangerous.</p> <p class="p3">Vasyl, with pure white hair and bushy eyebrows, seems a kind, gentle old man; as he speaks to us he is calming Vitalik, stroking his shoulder and murmuring to him. Vitalik is rocking, agitated, staring at the strangers. He knows what&rsquo;s going on, his grandmother insists &ndash; just can&rsquo;t express himself. The idea of this highly strung, nervous boy being seized by troops is almost incomprehensible. But on 22 March, that&rsquo;s what happened.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your nationalist?&rdquo; a soldier nicknamed &ldquo;Bes&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Demon&rdquo;, had demanded of Volodymyr&rsquo;s elderly father. His men turned the house upside down looking for pro-Ukrainian literature. Volodymyr, sensibly, had hidden the flags he&rsquo;d kept from his time on the Maidan &ndash; Ukraine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Revolution of Dignity&rdquo;, which overthrew corrupt ruler Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.</p> <p class="p5">Both Volodymyr and Vitalik were taken to a nearby &ldquo;special department&rdquo; for a few hours, where Volodymyr was beaten, then both were returned home. Olena thinks it was probably a mistake that they took Vitalik. But Volodymyr knew they&rsquo;d be back for him. It was at this point he took a shovel and dug a hole under the cherry tree in his father&rsquo;s garden. He buried the notebook in which he&rsquo;d been describing their life under occupation.&ldquo;Give it to our guys [as everyone calls the Ukrainian Armed Forces] when they come,&rdquo; he told his father.</p> <p class="p3">A little later the soldiers returned, grabbed the writer while he was cooking on an open fire in the garden, and threw him into a bus on which they&rsquo;d daubed their infamous invasion symbol, the latin letter &ldquo;Z&rdquo;.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">The torture of not knowing</span></h2> <p class="p3">For Volodymyr&rsquo;s ex-wife, Vitalik&rsquo;s mother Iryna Novitska, the lack of information was unbearable. She lives in central Ukraine and had begged him, as everyone had, to get out while he still could. Their last communication was on 7 March when he&rsquo;d called to say troops had entered the village. Then a message, later that night: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wiped my phone contacts&rdquo;, to protect their identities from the soldiers, in case he was picked up.</p> <p class="p3">The mobile networks were knocked out, one by one. Silence. Kapytolivka, like all the other villages and towns the Russians occupied, was swallowed up. It just disappeared into an information blackout for six long months. Relatives in free Ukraine had no idea if their loved ones in the occupied territories were hungry or fed, wounded or safe, imprisoned, scared . . . dead. Meanwhile, those inside the &ldquo;dark zone&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t know what had become of the rest of the country. Propaganda from Moscow told them lies: Kharkiv has fallen, Kyiv has fallen.</p> <p class="p3">In the occupied towns, troops &ndash; both from Russia and conscripts from the so-called &ldquo;republics&rdquo; of Donetsk and Luhansk &ndash; roamed the streets, drunk and dangerous, searching men for &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; tattoos, and taking them to torture cells, ten of which were later found in Izium alone. Informers were apparently active in the village. Volodomyr&rsquo;s family suspect this is how he was picked up. Long before the invasion, he had predicted that the neighbours would turn him in.</p> <p class="p5">Throughout the spring and summer, 71-year-old Olena, struggling with the lack of food, medicine, gas, water and electricity, traipsed back and forth to checkpoints and distant military commanders&rsquo; offices, searching for information about her son, and pleading with the Russians to let him go. The couple made written statements to the new &ldquo;authorities&rdquo;; detailed descriptions of Volodymyr and his arrest. The men promised they weren&rsquo;t holding him; scoffed at the very suggestion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not Nazis!&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Some rumours reached her; that her Vovka was in Russia, awaiting trial. Or in a prison in occupied Donetsk. After the region was liberated in September, there was a terrible confusion over the mass grave lists: &ldquo;Vakulenko&rdquo; from Kapytolivka was listed. But no date of death was given, and authorities said it was a woman&rsquo;s body in that pit. Could it have been a mistake? &ldquo;I am living on hope,&rdquo; Olena told me, that day in October. &ldquo;I have to. He&rsquo;s my only son.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">The Executed Renaissance</span></h2> <p class="p3">The idea that a children&rsquo;s writer can be murdered because he believed in his own country is so absurd, so appalling, that you want to find another version of events to believe in. But actually, none of the writers I was with seemed surprised by what had likely happened to Volodymyr. Horrified, deeply angry, but not surprised. The killing of writers and artists, of creative people who shape a national culture, is nothing new in the grim history of Ukrainian&ndash;Russian relations.</p> <p class="p3">Back in Kharkiv with the writers, I stayed one cold and eerie night in a building that stands as testament to Russia&rsquo;s repeated attempts to wipe out Ukrainian cultural life: the House of the Word, or Slovo. Built in the late 1920s, it contained high-end apartments that accommodated Ukrainian writers and intellectuals. They were prized by the state in the brief period when Kharkiv was capital of Soviet Ukraine and had a flourishing literary scene. But then came the 1930s. The very idea of Ukrainian culture became anathema. In the countryside, Stalin killed millions with man-made famine, and in Kharkiv&rsquo;s Slovo he killed the poets, playwrights and novelists. I lay awake in the dark listening to intermittent air-raid sirens and thinking of the night-time knocks from NKVD officers which preceded the execution of 33 of this building&rsquo;s residents. But their senseless deaths &ndash; many in a camp in northwest Russia &ndash; did not prevent this group, known as the Executed Renaissance, from having a lasting influence.</p> <p class="p5">Victoria Amelina is their cultural descendant: a writer who vividly describes life, who is actively engaged in that old, old struggle to build a sovereign, free Ukraine. It was she who dug up Volodymyr&rsquo;s notebook in September, shortly after the Russians had fled Kapytolivka. She was in the area to document war crimes with an NGO. It took a few minutes of digging to find the little parcel. The day made a lasting, deep impression on her. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re digging up the diary of a kidnapped writer from under a cherry tree, well &ndash; you feel you&rsquo;re somewhere in the 30s, when our writers were shot. Or in the 40s, under Nazi occupation,&rdquo; she told a TV news crew covering the story.</p> <p class="p3">Victoria [who was interviewed in the Summer 2022 <em>New Humanist</em>] kept a little acorn from the garden that day, a physical memory, and was still carrying it in her pocket when we spoke in November. &ldquo;You know they took literature from his room?&rdquo; she asked me. &ldquo;Books with blue and yellow, or the trident [the Ukrainian national symbol]. They took some as proof of his being Ukrainian, they equal this with &lsquo;Nazi&rsquo;. This is how genocidal logic works.&rdquo; With the family&rsquo;s permission she handed the diary to the Kharkiv Literary Museum for safekeeping. &ldquo;The museum has manuscripts of writers from the Executed Renaissance period; it&rsquo;s symbolic.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">When I go to the museum, on a cold November day marked by power blackouts and snowfall, the curator, wearing white cotton gloves, gently pulls back the tissue paper and shows me the densely scrawled text, in black and red biro, scored out in places and spilling over into the margins. The very last line Volodymyr wrote in the diary he buried &ndash; &ldquo;I believe in victory!&rdquo; &ndash; is the same line I hear across Ukraine, day after day, week after week, as the war grinds on and people cling to their faith in their armed forces to drive out the occupier. Belief &ndash; hope &ndash; is non-negotiable. You must keep it, in order to keep going in the face of horror and terror.</p> <p class="p3">But hope can be terrible too. After the bodies from the mass graves were exhumed and taken to Kharkiv for analysis in September, the family were told to wait for DNA results. Olena still felt her son was alive. Nobody released from Izium&rsquo;s many torture basements had seen Volodya that whole time. Perhaps he&rsquo;d gone to prison?</p> <p class="p3">In mid-November, while in Donbas reporting near the front line, I got a message from Iryna Novitska, Volodymyr&rsquo;s ex-wife. &ldquo;Hope has turned to darkness,&rdquo; she said simply. A photograph had emerged: gruesome, awful and irrefutably depicting Volodymyr before he was buried. Olena had seen it. It was all over.</p> <p class="p3">Ukrainian journalists found the man who took the picture &ndash; a local, tasked with collecting bodies and burying them in the pine forest during the occupation. He&rsquo;d taken photos so relatives could identify the bodies later. Volodymyr&rsquo;s body had not been taken from a morgue or basement but from a spot by the side of the road where he may have lain for weeks. The body had bullet holes in the stomach and chest, from a Soviet-era &ldquo;Makarov&rdquo; pistol.</p> <h2 class="p4">Echoes of the past</h2> <p class="p5">The next day I took a detour on the way back to Kharkiv, to see Olena one last time. She was heartbroken and furious, thinking back to those long months walking, exhausted, round the checkpoints for information. She recalled a meeting in April with a Russian commander, how he looked at the wall behind her, not meeting her gaze: &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re looking, there&rsquo;s no information&rdquo; &ndash; and I knew then that he knew everything,&rdquo; she said, shaking with anger. &ldquo;Where my son was, what happened to him, everything. There was not the slightest point &ndash; everyone knew, but no one was going to say.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Vitalik&rsquo;s cartoons were playing in the background, and he was laughing at the TV. She hadn&rsquo;t figured out how to tell him yet. He and Volodymyr were joined at the hip. It pained her that this boy was left without a father. She won&rsquo;t be able to cope with his 24-hour-care for ever. Volodymyr used to joke with his mother that he&rsquo;d live a long life, always taking care of Vitalik, going to a nursing home together in old age so they could be together for ever.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;Oh and what have you done,&rdquo; she cried suddenly, berating her son. &ldquo;What have you done, oh God, oh my God.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">As a writer, his ex-wife Iryna said, Volodymyr &ldquo;tried to say something in a way that no one had said before&rdquo;. He loved the unusual, the amazing, the unique; his interests were wide-ranging, and though his heart and soul were in the Ukrainian fight, he made common cause with other people living under the shadow of Moscow&rsquo;s empire: the Crimean Tatars, Armenians, Ichkerians, Belarussians.</p> <p class="p3">The investigation into who shot him and why will go on, as will countless others; a long slow reckoning that will never provide all the answers. But the soldiers who took Volodymyr were clear: it was his &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo; that made him guilty. So many stories like this have been uncovered, of Russian soldiers convinced by propaganda back home that Ukraine is a nest of Nazis. Stripping people and ransacking houses for &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; like blue and yellow ribbons, trident tattoos, books in their own language.</p> <p class="p3">Too often in this war, the echoes of the past are deafening: not just of the atrocities committed by the Nazis, but of Stalin&rsquo;s terror the decade before that. We, in recent years, comfortably consigned all that to history, at least in Europe. The mass executions and jackbooted soldiers, the columns of tanks and sadistic torturers, informants and brave resisters, existed in a black-and-white era.</p> <p class="p3">To the Ukrainian woman digging up a diary of a disappeared children&rsquo;s writer, just a few miles away from the heavy stench of mass graves, it is not history. Victoria Amelina thinks she knows why it&rsquo;s happened again: there was never any reckoning for the Soviet Union&rsquo;s crimes in Ukraine. And certainly no reckoning for what she calls the &ldquo;annihilation of an entire generation of Ukrainian culture&rdquo; in the 1930s: the execution of all those writers.</p> <p class="p3">As there were blacklists then, there are blacklists now, she concluded. Activists, influencers, people to be removed first. The Russians [according to Ukrainian authorities] came with 45,000 body bags. &ldquo;But they expected to win the war in three days,&rdquo; Victoria said. &ldquo;So those thousands of body bags were for whom? For me, I guess, and everyone else like me.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>
