<p class="lead">As anyone who has ever raised aquarium fish knows, they&#8217;re all <em>different</em>. Maybe you think a fish is just a fish, not very different from one another and all rather stupid, but I spent <em>years</em> sitting next to tanks of zebrafish, and I can tell you you&#8217;re wrong. I&#8217;d watch them gamboling about, and you&#8217;d quickly realize that oh, that one is aggressive, that one likes to hid, that one gets the zoomies and darts about the tank. You can learn to recognize individual fish by their behavior.</p>
<p>I always wondered about that. These were highly inbred animals, with only slight genetic differences between them, but could those little genetic variations account for strong differences in behavior? Then I acquired a new line of zebrafish, one that was the product of hybridization between our inbred lines and wild-caught native stocks, and oh boy, their behavior was radically different, instantly distinguishable. Maybe it is genetic. Maybe? I never did a formal, rigorous behavioral experiment, so I don&#8217;t know for sure.</p>
<p>But now a new study comes along that does what I would have been excited to know about 20 years ago (and I still am!). This is an analysis of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34113-y"><i>The emergence and development of behavioral individuality in clonal fish</i></a>, and it&#8217;s a bit surprising. Laskowski and others are working with the Amazon Molly, a small tropical fish that <a href="https://www.txst.edu/research/story-archive/2018-stories/amazon-molly-genome-research.html">reproduces clonally</a>, producing clutches of babies that are all genetically identical to each other &#8212; so even better than my old zebrafish &#8212; that can then be separated and raised apart from their mothers and siblings. This rules out the possibility of genetic differences causing individual differences, and leaves us to consider alternative sources of variation.</p>
<blockquote><p>To determine the causes and mechanisms that can generate behavioral individuality in the absence of genetic and environmental differences, it is essential to first pinpoint when behavioral individuality emerges and how it continues to unfold after emergence. Birth marks a critical time point: if individuality is present at birth, this points to pre-birth influences––such as epigenetics, maternal effects, and/or pre-birth developmental stochasticity––as being key drivers of individuality. Alternatively, it could be that individuality primarily emerges after birth. This emergence could happen both gradually throughout early life, which would suggest that individuality is driven by positive feedbacks between behavior and the internal and/or external environment, or abruptly at particular points early in life, if it is linked to critical sensitive windows.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if cloned fish are behaviorally identical to one another at Day One, but become different later on, that suggests the differences are generated by varying experiences over time. If, on the other hand, the genetically identical fish are different on Day One, that suggests that pre-birth factors (I&#8217;d lean towards favoring developmental stochasticity, just random variations at the cell and molecular level) generated the variation.</p>
<p>To cut to the conclusion, Amazon mollies differ on Day One, with all that implies.</p>
<p>I think their chosen behavior is a bit simple, they&#8217;re just looking at mean swimming speed &#8212; does a fish have the zoomies, or is it a calm quiet little guy? &#8212; which is fine, since they do get an early difference. They also used motion analysis software, so I presume they could go back and reanalyze the data for more subtle differences, but they got their answer with just one parameter. They also looked for other possible correlations.</p>
<p>Individuality is present at day one after birth and is not explained by differences in maternal identity or body size.<br />
<div id="attachment_68379" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/individuality-at-birth.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/individuality-at-birth-500x174.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="174" class="size-large wp-image-68379" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/individuality-at-birth-500x174.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/individuality-at-birth-150x52.jpg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/individuality-at-birth-300x104.jpg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/individuality-at-birth.jpg 685w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Repeatability of median swimming speed at hourly intervals on the first day after birth (A); each line represents one individual (N = 26). Maternal identity (B) did not explain variation in swimming speeds among individuals. Small and large points indicate the hourly (i.e. 11 data points per individual) and daily median swimming speeds, respectively, of individuals from each mother on day one after birth; see also Table 1. Behavior on day one after birth (C) was not related to an individual’s total length on their first day of life; see also Supplementary Table 3. Small and large points indicate hourly and daily median swimming speeds for each individual respectively; gray lines indicate posterior estimates for the effects of body size on behavior. Throughout, lines and points are colored according to the individual’s behavior in hour one on day one (yellow represents higher swimming speeds; purple indicates lower swimming speeds).</p></div></p>
<p>In panel A you can see that there was a huge amount of individual variation in swimming speed. In B, different mothers all produce progeny with a wide range of behaviors. That one has me wondering, though: Mama a&#8217;s babies were all a bit on the sluggish side. If they raise a second clutch from Mama a, does the second set exhibit a range of behaviors similar to that of the first set? Is there any genetic bias at all in this behavior?</p>
<p>Panel C shows that there was also variation in body length on Day One, which doesn&#8217;t surprise me at all &#8212; developmental stochasticity again. Body length is not a predictor of swimming speed, though, these seem to be unlinked variables.</p>
<p>Another feature of the study is that they observed the fish longitudinally, over 10 weeks of development. Variation increased, which would surprise no one, and it was correlated with Day One behavior. Zoomy fish stayed zoomy and became even more zoomy, while slow fish generally stayed slow for their life.</p>
<p>Individuality increases gradually throughout the first 70 days of development.<br />
<div id="attachment_68380" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/variation-over-time.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/variation-over-time-500x392.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="392" class="size-large wp-image-68380" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/variation-over-time-500x392.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/variation-over-time-150x118.jpg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/variation-over-time-300x235.jpg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/11/variation-over-time.jpg 685w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The predicted values of median individual swimming speed diverge over time (A) leading to gradual increases in the among-individual variance and hence repeatability (B, not shown here) of behavior. These models included only the 26 individuals on which we had complete data for the first 10 weeks of life to ensure that absolute levels of variation would remain comparable over time. Individual lines in (A) are colored according to their predicted behavior in week 1 with yellow indicating greater swimming speeds and purple indicating lower swimming speeds.</p></div></p>
<p>What have we learned?</p>
<blockquote><p>Evidence is accumulating that even genetically identical animals reared under near identical conditions develop behavioral individuality, yet little is known about when exactly these differences emerge during ontogeny and how they continue to change during early life development. We show that genetically identical individuals already exhibit substantial behavioral individuality on their first day of life, highlighting pre-birth influences as being of critical importance to initializing durable behavioral differences among individuals. Epigenetic and maternal effects mediated through mechanisms such as changes to DNA methylation patterns or differential resource or hormone allocation, could influence the phenotype of offspring.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m still intrigued by the role of chance in development and evolution.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another non-mutually exclusive hypothesis is that the behavioral variation we observed is the result of developmental stochasticity, that is, stochastic variation in any molecular, neurological or physiological markers that occur over ontogeny. An intriguing possibility is that the phenotypic variation we observed here––whether arising from epigenetic, maternal, and/or developmental stochasticity effects––might itself be adaptive, for example, as a potential bet-hedging strategy. Generating phenotypic variation among one’s offspring by such non-genetic means might be especially relevant in clonal organisms such as the Amazon molly. There is, for example, evidence in clonal fish, and poecilid fish specifically, that DNA methylation mechanisms and developmental plasticity more generally might be especially sensitive to environmental influences, offering a mechanism through which mothers can generate variation among their otherwise genetically identical offspring.</p></blockquote>
<p>Developmental stochasticity as part of an evolutionary bet-hedging strategy sounds like an interesting model, and probably important in species like fish (and spiders!) that pump out huge numbers of offspring with concommitant high likelihood of death.</p>
<p>This kind of behavioral analysis of organisms with limited genetic variation is one motivation for what I&#8217;m doing in the lab &#8212; taking the offspring of one spider parent and then inbreeding them over multiple generations to reduce genetic variability in one lab population. A couple more generations, and then it&#8217;ll be time to work out some behavioral assays to identify differences that we can select for. Swimming speed won&#8217;t be one of our parameters, though. Not even speed in general, they tend to all be quiet lurkers.  Web configuration, aggression, pigment patterns, though, those are all candidates for analysis down the line.</p>

<p>They think students should just toughen up, they can&#8217;t possibly be stressed. And if they&#8217;re stressed, they shouldn&#8217;t be able to find the energy to protest injustice. They really are serving up a heaping bowl of bullshit in this segment. If you like cats, you&#8217;re a snowflake! If you can&#8217;t make it in college, then just drop out, said in a pitying tone of voice, because spending four years in advanced and difficult studies of complex topics is soooo easy, and they&#8217;re there just to <q>take advantage of the freebies</q>.</p>
<p>What freebies? College is expensive (it shouldn&#8217;t be) and it&#8217;s mainly a lot of hard work and stress, genuine stress.</p>
<p>Then they invent stupid problems, like that students are <q>man-handling</q> the cats. They think the appropriate way to help students learn is to take the George C. Scott approach, and slap them. Nope. Colleges are staffed with trained professional educators who know better, and are aware that physically assaulting people is not a good way to motivate them.</p>
<p>Who are these appallingly stupid people on this panel? I don&#8217;t want to know. I also don&#8217;t understand how this is going to appeal to their base. Where I live, that base is a population of farmers with barn cats and a good ol&#8217; dog on the front porch and kids who are in 4H and love their farm animals to bits, who will watch movies like <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ugmb4G"><i>Old Yeller</i></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3NpLhvL"><i>Dog</i></a> and struggle to hold back a tear at the end. This is just desperate reaching for something to despise about young people getting educated, and being smarter than every hateful dolt on that network.</p>

<p class="lead">Uh-oh. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/10/31/productivity-down-employers-worried-recession/">workers aren&#8217;t working as hard as they should.</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Employers across the country are worried that workers are getting less done — and there’s evidence they’re right to be spooked.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2022, productivity — the measure of how much output in goods and services an employee can produce in an hour — plunged by the sharpest rate on record going back to 1947, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>The productivity plunge is perplexing, because productivity took off to levels not seen in decades when the coronavirus forced an overnight switch to remote work, leading some economists to suggest that the pandemic might spark longer-term growth. It also raises new questions about the shift to hybrid schedules and remote work, as employees have made the case that flexibility helped them work more efficiently. And it comes at a time when “quiet quitting” — doing only what’s expected and no more — is resonating, especially with younger workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>That certainly is troubling to employers. This article tries to answer why, and the journalist sets off on a quest to find the causes. I&#8217;m not going to discuss the answers at all because they&#8217;re garbage, but I instead browsed the article to see who they talked to.</p>
<p>&#8220;professor of economics…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tech CEOs…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Microsoft chief executive…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaders…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;founder of Career/Life Alliance Services…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Managers…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;chief operating officer…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;economist Lawrence H. Summers…&#8221; (Fuck Larry Summers)</p>
<p>&#8220;lead economist…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;chief economist…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;chief economist at the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;senior economist…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;many economists…&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow. That reporter sure spent a lot of time on the phone &#038; email talking to people about why workers were in a slump. There&#8217;s talk about burnout, and the pandemic, and the recession, and the labor shortage, and workers setting more boundaries, and &#8220;quiet quitting&#8221;, but I noticed that someone was missing. There&#8217;s someone &#8212; a lot of someones &#8212; nobody talked to.</p>
<p><strong>Workers</strong>.</p>
<p>Gosh, that&#8217;s a peculiar omission. You try to find out why worker productivity is down, so you go talk to the employers to try to figure out why, and you get a lot of fuzzy, vague answers and shrugs. I wonder why?</p>
<p>My personal answer would be that what I&#8217;ve experienced and learned in the last few years is that I don&#8217;t like managers and tech CEOs and bosses and economists and think tanks and executives and good goddamn, <em>fuck</em> Larry Summers and why the hell do journalists still talk to him? It&#8217;s clear to me now, at last, in my old age, that capitalist businesses and institutions don&#8217;t care about workers except as hands and brains and eyes to be exploited to make money for the middle men and executives, and that very little of the vast profits management makes will trickle down to the people who do the work. Instead, they&#8217;ll use that money to buy politicians and found new companies that will find fresh ways to squeeze blood from the masses. Oh, you brought home a few pennies from a day&#8217;s work? Then you can afford to spend them on insurance and health care, those executives love to wring out your pockets, too. What&#8217;s this? You need a place to live? All the houses have been bought by landlords, who are eager to raise your rents. And if anyone notices they&#8217;re being gouged, well, we&#8217;ll distract them with lurid tales of drag queens reading children&#8217;s books and trans people using the bathroom and black folk protesting the denial of their rights and if that&#8217;s not enough, we&#8217;ve got a well-armed paramilitary police force staffed with bullies and haters.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my answer. The system is so broken that the curtain hiding the machinations of the CEOs and big money executives is in tatters, and we are starting to see how our labor is stolen by the people we used to trust to manage our workplace, our communities, our country. Why should I work harder? Any extra effort is going to gain me nothing, because it&#8217;s going to be siphoned off by some asshole in a suit with a McMansion and a vacation home and an overpriced car and a condo in Cabo, paying private school tuition to keep their kids away from my kids, all built on <em>my</em> faith and trust and confidence in the system.</p>
<p>Well, guys, my faith and trust and confidence have been blown to flinders in the last few years. You&#8217;re going to have to find some other sucker to play your con game. I suspect a lot of workers are feeling the same way.</p>
<p>But you won&#8217;t know because you don&#8217;t talk to them.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
