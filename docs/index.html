<p class="lead">The first step in making money with Twitter is to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/musk-reshapes-twitter-academics-ponder-taking-flight">drive away all those scientists</a>. They&#8217;re so critical!</p>
<blockquote><p>Still, with uncertainty about how Twitter will change under Musk, many of the thousands of medical and scientific experts on the platform have started to look for alternatives or are considering giving up on social media altogether. For a while the hashtags #GoodbyeTwitter and #TwitterMigration were trending, and many researchers have been posting their new Mastodon handles, encouraging others to follow them to the site, which has gained more than 100,000 new users within days of Musk completing his purchase.</p>
<p>For the moment, most researchers are waiting to see what happens with Twitter. “I’m hedging my bets with a Mastodon account but not planning to leave in the short term,” says biologist Carl Bergstrom (@CT_Bergstrom, 163,000 followers) of the University of Washington, Seattle. Many other researchers are doing the same. That means even if little changes for now, the groundwork is being laid for what could quickly become a digital mass migration of scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once those old crotchety stick-in-the-muds are gone, Twitter will prosper. Just like when chasing away those computer scientists made it possible to sell <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/10/01/musks-demo-was-bad-and-he-should-be-ashamed-and-his-cheering-stans-should-be-embarrassed/">dancing serfs as robots</a>, and making the neuroscientists <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2019/09/26/neuralink-is-99-hype/">roll their eyes at Neuralink</a> opened the door to brain surgery on his fans, and <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/02/26/somebody-else-says-it-musk-is-a-charlatan/">horrifying space science realists</a> makes it possible to sell seats on a rocket to millionaires, Musk has a grand plan. By antagonizing all the rational people, he&#8217;s left with a market packed with fools &#8212; it&#8217;s like those Nigerian prince scams, where the skeptics get turned off by the subject line, but if the mark reads through a whole paragraph, you know you&#8217;ve got a potential sucker.</p>
<p>Like Bergstrom, I&#8217;m staying on Twitter for now &#8212; for the lulz, if nothing else &#8212; but I also have a backup plan with an account on mastodon that I set up 5 years ago (I&#8217;m on <a href="https://octodon.social/@pzmyers">octodon.social/@pzmyers</a>, if you want to track me down). There, I&#8217;ve noticed a recent flood of familiar science-related names showing up, which is nice. It&#8217;s always been a pleasant crowd over there, but I was sad that I had to go to Twitter to hang out with most of my science-related online pals, and now Twitter is becoming less and less essential.</p>
<p>By the way, if you find Mastodon confusing, <a href="https://skullsinthestars.com/2022/11/07/an-intro-to-mastodon-from-a-relative-newcomer/">DrSkySkull has written a short guide</a>.</p>

He spearheaded a new field known as paleogenomics, renewing debates about interbreeding between our earliest ancestors and their Neanderthal neighbours. We now know, for instance, that European and Asian populations have inherited around 2 per cent of their genome from Neanderthals: evidence of an intimacy between our species that had long been questioned. <br><br>We diverged from Neanderthals around 650,000 years ago. They had similar sized brains to us and were an intelligent and social species. Despite this, the superior cognitive capacities of early modern humans &ndash; evidenced through superior technology, art, and cultural practices &ndash; may have allowed them to eventually outcompete our doomed cousins.<br><br>In the same month as receiving the Nobel, P&auml;&auml;bo&rsquo;s team published research in the journal Science, providing compelling evidence of the genetic changes underlying this cognitive divergence. They considered the TLKT1 gene, in which only one amino acid out of hundreds differs between Neanderthal and modern human DNA. The human version of TLKT1 is preferentially expressed in the neocortex during fetal development, a region of the brain involved in complex tasks like conscious thought and language.<br><br>Based on these observations, the team hypothesised that the human-specific changes may have been a key driver of advanced cognition during human evolution. They were able to demonstrate that the human version of TLKT1 drives significantly greater proliferation of young brain cells in the neocortex, known as neural progenitors, when compared to the Neanderthal version.</p> <p>The work provides compelling evidence that a single genetic change may have driven growth of the neocortex, or a greater density of neurons within it, among early humans, potentially contributing to our cognitive advantage over Neanderthals and other extinct hominins.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from our New Humanist winter edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Lightning-fast quantum computers are set to revolutionise how we solve complex mathematical and modelling problems, helping us with big challenges from the climate crisis to the future of healthcare.<br><br>The underlying physics behind these technologies is quantum entanglement. This strange concept describes how entangled particles share a correlation to each other, maintained no matter how far apart they are in the Universe. If we know what the correlation pattern is &ndash; for example, for an entangled pair it could be black and white, or up and down &ndash; measuring one lets us know what state the other is in, without us having to check. <br><br>Already mind-boggling? Well, here comes the even weirder part. Under the realm of quantum mechanics, the state of a particle is only determined once it is measured or observed. Before this happens, the particle exists as a superposition of all the possible states it can be in. <br><br>So, for entangled pairs, how can they be correlated if they cannot be in pre-determined states at the point of creation? Do they send signals to each other across vast distances at the point of measurement? No, light can only travel at the speed of light and not instantaneously between distances. Do they carry secret, hidden instructions about what state to be in once measured? <br><br>The answer to this last question is also no. And the evidence for this was provided by genius experiments designed by John Clauser, Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger. Together, they have been awarded this year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work exploring the strange-but-true phenomenon of quantum entanglement &ndash; or &ldquo;spooky action at a distance&rdquo;, as Albert Einstein described it. <br><br>This work is important, because once we are able to understand and apply the principle of quantum entanglement in a practical way, we unleash the power of quantum technology to transform our world, turning the dream of a quantum revolution into a reality.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from our New Humanist winter edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Credit: Garry Knight" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Mahsa_Amini_Protest_2__52375007956_.jpeg" height="683" alt="Photos taken at a protest at London's Piccadilly Circus against mandatory hijab in Iran." width="1024"></p> <p>Protests across Iran, sparked by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, have put a long overdue spotlight on the repressive Islamic Republic and the notorious <em>Gasht-e Ershad</em>, or morality police. Arrested for wearing her hijab in an &ldquo;improper manner&rdquo; on 13 September in Tehran, Amini&rsquo;s death three days later in police custody, under suspicious circumstances, has drawn global condemnation for what looks to many like the murder of a young woman on the grounds of her clothing. <br><br>&ldquo;Women, life, freedom&rdquo; is the slogan of the wave of protests taking place across the country. The brutal crackdown has led to at least 234 deaths, <a href="https://iranhr.net/en/articles/5535/#:~:text=Iran%20Human%20Rights%20(IHRNGO)%3B,up%20the%20killing%20of%20protesters.">according to the Oslo-based Iran Human Rights NGO</a>, including 29 children. That was the death toll published on 25 October, a day before the gathering at Amini&rsquo;s grave to mark 40 days since her death &ndash; the end of the traditional mourning period in Iran. This saw a spike of arrests and violence again, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/27/iran-protests-mahsa-amini-memorial">shots fired at protesters</a> and tear gas used on the thousands of mourners who gathered in Saqqez in the western Kurdistan province, Amini&rsquo;s home town. <br><br>The forced hijab, long a symbol of repression, has now become a renewed focus of the struggle for the emancipation of women and for the rights and freedom of all people in Iran. For many, &ldquo;women, life, freedom&rdquo; is also a call for a democratic, secular nation, shouted alongside &ldquo;death to the dictator&rdquo; and &ldquo;down with theocracy&rdquo;. <br><br>Wearing the veil has been compulsory in Iran since the Islamic revolution and the birth of the Republic in 1979, when the nation was placed under the rule of a theocratic elite. The morality police force was officially set up in the early 1990s, and while it has the authority to discipline all citizens, it is women who in reality bear the brunt of oppression from the force, which has access to arms and what they call &ldquo;re-education centres&rdquo;. Amini&rsquo;s brother <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/09/16/woman-dies-custody-irans-morality-police">was told</a> that his sister would be brought to an &ldquo;educational and orientation class&rdquo;, before he discovered she had in fact been taken to hospital in a coma, where she later died.<br><br>Will the protests bring about real change? The Iranian state certainly seems fearful of this prospect, unleashing the full brutality of its police and intelligence services in order to crush the spirit of the protestors: firing live ammunition, issuing fatal beatings and using torture, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/iran-leaked-documents-reveal-top-level-orders-to-armed-forces-to-mercilessly-confront-protesters/">according to Amnesty International</a>. <br><br>Global support is crucial. Protests in Berlin, London, the US and elsewhere have built pressure and no doubt boosted morale, with women taking to the streets and cutting off their hair in solidarity with protestors in Iran who are cutting or shaving their hair, and burning their hijabs. <br>Yet so far, international measures have been limited. In October, the UK put sanctions on the morality police, banning them from coming to the UK and freezing any assets held here. The EU and US have also imposed sanctions on the morality police and some senior security figures. This might discourage some people from joining the <em>Gasht-e Ershad</em>, but it is unlikely to have a significant change on the behaviour of the Iranian regime as a whole. There is little sign thus far that western countries will cut diplomatic ties with Iran. The US is particularly loath to do so, fearing it would threaten ongoing nuclear talks. <br><br>We have a clear responsibility to support the protestors against a state that enjoys impunity while it systematically violates the human rights of its citizens, and subjugates half of its population. As Humanists UK vice-president Shaparak Khorsandi <a href="https://humanists.uk/2022/09/21/shaparak-khorsandi-condemns-killing-of-iranian-woman-over-hijab-law/">said</a>: &ldquo;The Iranian regime kills women for trying to live freely. This is not just Iran&rsquo;s problem, it is the world&rsquo;s problem.&rdquo; <br><br>Controlling how women dress is a hallmark of despotic regimes around the world. As Iranian judicial officials <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/31/iran-to-hold-public-trials-for-up-to-2000-detained-amid-protests">announce their intention</a> to put up to 2,000 protestors on trial, we must see this fight for what it is: a struggle for freedom that affects us all.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistLaurieLimbosmall.jpg" height="1281" alt="Laurie Taylor cartoon by Martin Rowson" width="1636"></p> <p>Several of my ageing friends are moving house. Ian McDonald, who always seemed as much a part of Chelsea as the King&rsquo;s Road, is upping sticks and heading for a largely unpronounceable dwelling in the north of Scotland. Meanwhile, Geoff Holdsworth, who always appeared as settled in Soho as The French House, emails me to say that he is returning to his roots in Leicester. One can readily understand these moves as a desire for a second childhood. Having been out in the big wide world for most of their adult lives, these good old friends of mine are now saying goodbye to the supposed artificialities of London life and returning to what they conceive of as the simple authenticity of their formative years.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m unlikely to follow them. Not because I lack sentiment about my childhood homes. I can readily conjure up happy visions of walking through the vast open spaces of Sutton Park or taking a bracing dip in the brown waters of the River Mersey after a picnic on Crosby beach. But I&rsquo;m now far too old to imagine that I might be allowed to enjoy the indulgence of any more lifetime experiences. This is my last life on Earth.</p> <p>This, of course, is the whole problem with atheism. It robs you of the delightful possibility of an after-life. I believed years ago, with an absolute Catholic certainty, that my final days would not be spent in a Scottish croft or a suburban Leicester villa, but in a resting place for my Christian soul. From an early age, I reckoned that place would be Purgatory &ndash; a realm reserved for minor sinners, and a relatively pleasing prospect when compared to its infernal alternative.</p> <p>However, in Catholic theology, it was not a particularly well-defined location. Heaven, by comparison, was well documented. There would be clouds to sit upon, harps to strum and a diet of milk and honey to be enjoyed in the blessed company of saints and martyrs.Hell, if one excludes Dante&rsquo;s poetical cornucopia of horrors, was even more straightforward. It was hot. Very, very hot. Burning hot. But not quite hot enough to consume you and thereby end your suffering. Purgatory, though, lacked all such detail. There was no promise of happy harpists or fork-tongued devils, but only the prospect of a somewhat barren landscape in which you were required to wait and wait until your sentence was deemed to have been served, your sins to have been purged.</p> <p>The great problem with Purgatory was the length of that sentence. It was not eternal, like Heaven and Hell. One could hardly go on being purged for ever. But were we talking months or years or decades? Fortunately, there was some clarification in the Catholic catechism. Here, one learned that the regular recital of certain prayers and regular attendance at acts of devotion might reduce your sentence by an explicit number of days. Three carefully recited rosaries earned an indulgence &ndash; a time-off for good behaviour bonus &ndash; of precisely 28 days. There it was, in neat brackets, in my personal catechism. I can clearly recall the childhood years when I would systematically tot up these indulgences in order to effect a speedier transit to eternal bliss.</p> <p>As an unbeliever, thankfully, I have one last hope of securing eternal life in Paradise: entrance into Limbo. According to Catholic teaching, this is a special part of Hell for those who were born before the birth of Christ. These unfortunate individuals never had the opportunity of gaining the usual visa requirements by being baptised into the true faith. Now, I was hardly born before the birth of Christ. However, according to my mother, I was baptised by a rather simple-minded and somewhat tipsy priest who apparently announced at the service that &ldquo;Florence&rdquo; Taylor was now &ldquo;a child of Christ&rdquo;.</p> <p>Might that mere slip of the tongue get me off the hook? Detach me from the devil&rsquo;s fork? Allow God to overlook all my years of disbelief and blasphemy and unrelenting sinfulness? Usher me into Paradise? I&rsquo;ll do my level best to let you know.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistQuantamComputer.jpg" height="841" alt="Martin Rowson cartoon on quantum computers" width="1000"></p> <p class="p1">It&rsquo;s 2042. A schoolgirl sits in her bedroom and sets her computer a problem. It splits into trillions upon trillions of copies of itself, each of which works on a separate strand. After only a few seconds, they all come back together and a single answer pops up on the screen. It is an answer that would have taken the fastest supercomputer in the world more than the age of the Universe to obtain. Satisfied that her homework is done, the girl shuts down her computer and goes out to play. This, in a nutshell, is a quantum computer.</p> <p class="p3">Quantum computers have the potential to change the world as profoundly as electricity did. &ldquo;If you imagine the difference between an abacus and the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputer&rdquo;, said BBC journalist Julian Brown, &ldquo;you would still not have the barest inkling of how much more powerful a quantum computer could be compared with the computers we have today.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Currently, all we have in laboratories around the world are stepping-stones on the road to building a useful quantum computer. The holy grail would be a general-purpose machine that could solve any conceivable problem in a fraction of the time of a conventional computer. But even if this proves impossible to achieve, we could still develop a more limited type of quantum computer that could, for instance, discover new drugs without the need for time-consuming and costly trials. The expectation is that one or other of these kinds of quantum computer could be with us within only 10 to 15 years.</p> <p class="p3">So, how do they work? Either a quantum computer behaves <em>as if</em> it exploits trillions upon trillions of copies of itself in parallel universes, or it actually does. Most physicists believe the former. However, one of the pioneers of quantum computing, David Deutsch of the University of Oxford, believes the quantum computer is something entirely new: the first device ever built that exploits parallel universes, or realities. He has a good reason for believing this. But first, some necessary background on quantum theory and how it makes possible quantum computers.</p> <h2 class="p4">Weird waves</h2> <p class="p5">Quantum theory is our best description of the submicroscopic world of atoms and their constituents. Experiments in the early 20th century revealed something scarcely believable about electrons, photons and all the building blocks of matter: they can behave both as particles (like tiny billiard balls) and waves (like ripples on a pond). The waves are peculiar: they are mathematical entities which are imagined to spread through space according to the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. Where the waves are big, there is a high chance of finding a particle such as an electron, and where they are small, there is a low chance.</p> <p class="p3">It follows that particles can do all the things that waves can. Imagine the sea on a stormy day. Big rolling waves are marching across it. Now imagine the next day when the storm has passed. The gentle breeze is driving small ripples. If you have ever looked closely at waves at sea, you will know that it is possible to have big rolling waves whose surface is rippled by the wind. This is a general property of all waves. If two or more waves are possible, so too is a combination.</p> <p class="p3">Now imagine a quantum wave that represents an oxygen atom and which is highly peaked on one side of a room (so there is an almost 100 per cent chance of finding it there) and another quantum wave that represents the same oxygen atom that is highly peaked on the other side of a room (so there is an almost 100 per cent chance of <em>also </em>finding it there). Remember, if any two waves can exist, so too can a combination. In this case, it represents the oxygen atom on both sides of the room at the same time. Bizarre as it seems, a quantum particle can not only be in more than one place at a time, they can also do more than one thing at a time. So, atoms and their constituents can do many things at once. A quantum computer simply exploits this ability in order to do many calculations at once.</p> <h2 class="p4">More calculations than fundamental particles</h2> <p class="p5">I first came across the term quantum computer in 1983 while at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and taking a series of lectures by Richard Feynman. Feynman had worked on the atomic bomb and won the Nobel Prize for Quantum Electrodynamics (and he played the bongos). At the time, he was recovering from cancer surgery so was indulged by the Caltech faculty and allowed to teach whatever he liked. His course was called &ldquo;Potentialities and Limitations of Computers&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">Feynman was interested in the ultimate physical limits of computers &ndash; how small components could be made, how fast, and so on. At the time, a transistor &ndash; the basic component of a computer &ndash; consisted of about 100 billion atoms. Nowadays, it is down to about 25,000. But Feynman realised miniaturisation would ultimately result in transistors made of single atoms, at which point they would dance to the tune of quantum theory. This would be a new kind of beast, he realised: a quantum computer.</p> <p class="p3">Whereas a normal computer consists of transistors, each of which represents a bit (a 0 or a 1, depending on whether the transistor allows an electric current through or not), a quantum computer consists of quantum bits, or qubits, each of which can represent a 0 and a 1 at the same time. Consequently, a qubit can be involved in two calculations simultaneously (one in which it is a 0, and another in which it is a 1). A pair of qubits can represent four possibilities simultaneously (01, 11, 10, 00) and so can be involved in four calculations at once; three cubits, eight calculations; and so on.</p> <p class="p3">The power of a quantum computer becomes clear. With each additional bit, a normal computer increases its power only marginally. With each extra qubit, the power of a quantum computer doubles. Very quickly, such an exponential growth in computing power beats into submission even the biggest supercomputers.</p> <p class="p5">Here is another way to appreciate the power of quantum computing. In 1965, Gordon Moore, head of the American chip manufacturer Intel, realised that computing power &ndash; the number of bits a computer can process, the number of bits it can store in its memory, and so on &ndash; was doubling roughly every two years. This has been going on since 1949 and is known as Moore&rsquo;s Law. Contrast this with the number of qubits available, which is doubling roughly every five years. Perhaps this appears less impressive. But, remember, each additional qubit doubles the power of a quantum computer. Quantum computers are therefore increasing their power as an exponential of an exponential. To put it another way, after four Moore&rsquo;s-Law-doublings, a conventional computer would be 16 times as powerful, whereas a quantum computer would be about 64,000 times as powerful.</p> <p class="p3">Currently, the record-holding quantum computer, announced by IBM in November 2021, has 120 qubits, almost doubling the number of qubits of the previous record-holder, built by Google. If a quantum computer were built that could manipulate a mere 270 qubits, however, it would reach a critical threshold: it would be able to do more calculations simultaneously than there are fundamental particles in the universe.</p> <p class="p3">This is why Deutsch thinks it is legitimate to ask: <em>where</em> is the quantum computer doing its calculations? The universe does not have the physical resources. Your computer, after all, can do only the calculations for which it has sufficient memory. Deutsch&rsquo;s answer is that the quantum computer exploits physical resources in parallel universes. It is a device, he claims, that literally forces us to take seriously such universes.</p> <p class="p3">Among other things, a general-purpose quantum computer might deliver true superior-to-human intelligence. But we face some challenges when it comes to creating a useful quantum computer.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">What problems could a quantum computer actually solve?</span></h2> <p class="p3">Firstly, in order to function, quantum systems need to operate in total isolation. This is because qubits are fragile and lose their ability to do many things at once if they are impacted by their surroundings. While it&rsquo;s relatively simple to isolate a single atom in a vacuum, it is harder with larger systems. The solution is to hold the qubits &ndash; which may be atoms or electrons or some other kind of quantum object &ndash; in an extreme vacuum so air molecules do not bounce off them, and to keep them cooled to close to absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, so &ldquo;photons&rdquo; of heat do not bounce off them.</p> <p class="p3">But this is impossible to do perfectly. There will always be stray air molecules and photons of light bouncing off qubits, causing them to lose their quantumness and &ldquo;decohere&rdquo; into normal bits. This can be corrected for; but each qubit requires anything from 10 to 100 qubits for the &ldquo;error correction&rdquo;. A conventional computer develops an error &ndash; a 0 flipping to a 1 or vice versa &ndash; about once every trillion trillion operations. The quantum computers under construction today develop an error about once every 1,000 operations. This is crippling, and makes it hard for these computers to perform even limited useful calculations.</p> <p class="p3">So, while IBM&rsquo;s quantum computer uses the most qubits of any existing prototype, most of these are needed simply for the task of error correction. To surmount this challenge, error correction would need to outpace the accumulation of errors &ndash; but it&rsquo;s unclear whether this will ever be possible.</p> <p class="p5">Once we&rsquo;ve built a powerful quantum computer, we would then be faced with the challenge of giving it useful tasks. A quantum computer operates by splitting into trillions upon trillions of copies of itself, each of which works on a separate strand of the same calculation. In the end, the strands come back together and the computer spits out a single answer. It is not possible to access these separate strands, as that would entail interacting with the quantum computer, destroying its quantumness. Put bluntly, it is very hard to find problems that require lots of parallel calculations that spit out a single answer.</p> <p class="p3">Nevertheless, in 1994, Peter Shor found just such a problem. He realised that a quantum computer could, in theory, break the RSA code used to encrypt all banking and internet data. RSA encryption relies on something that is easy to do but extremely hard to undo. It is easy to take two very big &ldquo;prime&rdquo; numbers and multiply them together, but is hard to take such a big number and find its prime factors. The security of an encrypted message relies on the fact that it would take centuries, even on the fastest supercomputer, for the code-breaker to find those prime factors. Shor showed that a quantum computer could achieve this in a split second.</p> <p class="p3">Shor&rsquo;s algorithm made people sit up. It did not matter that in 1994 no quantum computer existed that could implement the algorithm. The point was that the moment a working quantum computer was built, every piece of secret information exchanged in the world would be readable. There are rumours that intelligence agencies and criminals have long been harvesting financial and internet data in anticipation of that day.</p> <p class="p3">It could turn out that useful algorithms like Shor&rsquo;s are rare, and that it will never be possible to build a quantum computer capable of attacking a wide range of practical problems such as code-breaking. We may never be able to build a quantum computer powerful enough to create true artificial intelligence.</p> <h2 class="p4">Understanding how particles behave</h2> <p class="p5">Nevertheless, quantum computers could still change the world beyond recognition. This is because there is one thing that a quantum computer can certainly do: it can simulate a quantum system, thus predicting how it behaves. In fact, it was for this purpose that Feynman first envisioned a quantum computer in 1983.</p> <p class="p3">When it comes to how our world works, we are certain of very little. Physicists never like to admit that they have solved only one problem <em>exactly</em>: the two-body problem. They can predict, for example, the way in which an electron orbits a proton in the simplest (hydrogen) atom; or the way the Moon loops around the Earth. Everything else in physics is approximation. For instance, when more electrons are added to an atom, the behaviour of each electron depends on the behaviour of all the others and it quickly becomes impossible for even supercomputers to model.</p> <p class="p3">However, the behaviour of every atom and molecule depends on the arrangement of its electrons. It is via these that it interacts with the world. The electron arrangement determines its chemistry &ndash; how it conducts heat, electricity and so on. But we cannot predict the behaviour of any multi-electron system because we can only solve the two-body problem exactly. But a quantum computer could.</p> <p class="p3">Understanding how atoms and subatomic particles behave could have useful practical applications. Currently, we have to do drug trials because we cannot predict how drug molecules will behave in the body. But, with a quantum computer, we could circumvent all this and predict the behaviour of millions of potential drugs without having to do expensive and time-consuming trials.</p> <p class="p3">Smartphones and Tesla electric cars have been made possible by the development of lithium-ion batteries, which store a lot of energy in a small volume. But the world is running short of lithium. And finding new and better substances to act as batteries involves synthesising and testing thousands of upon thousands of potential molecules. It is expensive and time-consuming. However, with a quantum computer it would be possible to predict the behaviour of millions upon millions of molecules in advance, and so improve on lithium-ion batteries.</p> <p class="p5">Another application could help us to make farming more sustainable. About 40 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population depends on wheat, which requires fertiliser. But that relies on the Haber-Bosch process, which takes nitrogen from the air and puts it in ammonia, the basis of fertilisers. The trouble is that this process uses lots of energy &ndash; as much as the airline industry. In fact, 40 per cent of the carbon footprint of a loaf of bread comes from this process.</p> <p class="p3">Thankfully, Haber-Bosch is not the only game in town. Plants, in their roots, use bacteria which can efficiently take nitrogen out of the air. They do it with an enzyme called nitrogenase. However, nitrogenase has thus far been too complicated for us to understand. If we could understand how it worked by simulating it on a quantum computer, we could not only mimic its process but even improve on it. That would mean we could dispense with the hugely inefficient and energy-hungry Haber-Bosch process, which would have a huge impact on reducing the emissions behind global warming.</p> <p class="p3">We may never be able to make a general-purpose quantum computer capable of giving us access to superior-to-human intelligence. Even so, the world could still be changed beyond all recognition by quantum computers able to perform even limited calculations, revolutionising the fields of medicine, agriculture and technology &ndash; and this might be only the start. And if a general-purpose quantum computer<em> is</em> possible, all bets are off.</p> <p class="p3"><span class="s2"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></span></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
