            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">This morning, I discovered that my Twitter account is &#8220;rate-limited&#8221;. Actually, <em>everyone&#8217;s</em> account is rate-limited.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/twitter-is-dead.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/twitter-is-dead.png" alt="" width="451" height="404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70597" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/twitter-is-dead.png 451w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/twitter-is-dead-150x134.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2023/07/twitter-is-dead-300x269.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></a></p>
<p>So I&#8217;m only allowed to read 600 tweets per day. What that means in practical terms, since I follow about 800 people, when I first log in Twitter will access all the tweets made by those people overnight, and then…I&#8217;ve reached my limit within minutes, and I&#8217;m done. That&#8217;s all it takes, Twitter is over for me before I take my first sip of coffee.</p>
<p>I pity all those people who are paying $8 a month to get privileged access &#8212; now nobody is going to read their prioritized tweets, except other blue check users, and even then, only until they <em>finish</em> their breakfast, and then they&#8217;ll be done, too.</p>
<p>Brilliant move, Elon. Just shut it down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m on <a href="https://octodon.social/@pzmyers">@pzmyers@octodon.social</a>.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t follow Elon Musk, but does he even realize that he&#8217;s just effectively blocked people who do? Probably not.</p>

<p class="lead">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called all of his friends together and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kxkxq/robert-f-kennedy-jr-gives-the-game-away">opened his mouth</a>. It&#8217;s helpful to assemble a gang of like-minded people to encourage everyone to say exactly what they think without reservation, and oh boy, the stupidity flowed like water. Here are Kennedy&#8217;s colleagues: frauds, quacks, and morons, every one.</p>
<blockquote><p>The panelists Kennedy included were, by anyone’s standards, heavy hitters in the world of anti-vaccine activism and health freedom (a movement which advocates for non-traditional cures and fewer regulations in medicine). They included Dr. Joseph Mercola, an osteopathic physician and an extremely influential natural health figure who’s also a major funder of the anti-vaccine movement; Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, another osteopath and a longtime anti-vaccine activist best known for going viral when she falsely claimed COVID vaccines make one “magnetic”; Dr. Pierre Kory, a major promoter of ivermectin as an unproven and highly contested treatment for COVID; Sayer Ji, another major health freedom figure who often traffics in anti-vaccine claims on his site GreenMedInfo; Mikki Willis, the maker of the viral faux documentary Plandemic; Maureen McDonnell, a pediatric nurse turned anti-vaccine activist; and Patrick Gentempo, a former chiropractor and health freedom figure. The moderator was Charles Eisenstein, an author and lightly New Age-flavored motivational speaker who said he’s paused his career and is “working closely with Kennedy on policy,” while the ending remarks were delivered by anti-vaccine activist and filmmaker Del Bigtree. </p></blockquote>
<p>Even when the panelists disagreed, it was for stupid reasons and both sides got everything wrong.</p>
<blockquote><p>There was one notable point of semi-disagreement: Mikki Willis of Plandemic fame asked Kennedy if he believed the “climate change narrative has been exaggerated,” a loaded question for someone best known for many years as an environmental lawyer and activist. Kennedy responded that he believes climate change is real, but that he does not believe “carbon” is to blame. He added that climate science is not his strong suit. </p>
<p>&#8220;With vaccine science I know the science,&#8221; he added, citing his experience  litigating those cases. &#8220;I know the science back and forward. Climate science is so complex and knows so many disciplines&#8221; that he’s not as strong on it, he added, especially because it requires &#8220;mathematical modeling&#8221; and &#8220;chemistry.&#8221; That said, he added, “I think the climate narrative has been hijacked by the World Economic Forum and Bill Gates&#8221; and, like other crises, is being used by &#8220;elites to consolidate their power.” (Kennedy is a celebrity and part of the Democratic Party’s most durably powerful political family, the nephew of a former president and the son of a U.S. senator.) </p></blockquote>
<p>Keep that claim that he knows the science back and forward in mind when you <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-kennedy-anti-vaccine-panel-conspiracies-hiv-spanish-flu-1234779689/">read the rest</a>. Does he? Does he really?</p>
<blockquote><p>During the discussion, Kennedy made several unfounded claims regarding the origins of infectious diseases and their relationships to vaccines. At one point, he baselessly asserted that vaccine research had been responsible for the creation of some of the deadliest diseases in human history, including HIV, the Spanish flu, and Lyme disease. </p>
<p>“I will end all gain-of-function research [as president],” Kennedy said. “It’s just a disaster, it’s given us no benefits. It’s given us everything from Lyme disease to Covid, and many many other diseases. RSV, which is now one of the biggest killers of children, came out of a vaccine lab.” </p>
<p>“We can go down the whole list of diseases,” he added. “There’s even good evidence that even Spanish flu came from vaccine research.” </p>
<p>Kennedy then claimed that “the medical research on these diseases and vaccine research has actually created some of the worst plagues in our history. Anybody who reads The River will come away pretty much convinced that HIV also came from a vaccine program, there’s plenty of evidence on that as well.”</p>
<p>Kennedy has previously claimed, without evidence, that AIDS was not caused by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) but “a gay lifestyle” and the use of alkyl nitrites, or poppers. His 2021 book The Real Anthony Fauci included similar AIDS denialism — including the falsehood that the disease is not caused by HIV — views that he repeated this month on Joe Rogan’s podcast, which commands an audience of millions.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is basically claiming that every disease ever is the product of mad scientist-style experimentation. He forgot polio, tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, smallpox, cholera, rabies, pertussis, leprosy, measles, and the Black Death. Those 14th century epidemiologists were incredibly sophisticated, being able to cobble up a plague that killed a few hundred million people without even any knowledge of germ theory is impressive. It&#8217;s unclear why physicians throughout history have been interested in killing people slowly and agonizingly; it probably has something to do with kickbacks from Big Pharma, the Illuminati, and the Fuggers. Oh, and the Pope, and probably the Jews, the usual scapegoats.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, he definitely knows the science backwards. Forwards, not so much.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also not particularly sharp about history, or he wouldn&#8217;t make this claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I do not believe that infectious disease is an enormous threat to human health,” Kennedy added. The presidential hopeful stated that if he assumed office, he would target medical journals and redirect funding grants away from epidemiology. </p></blockquote>
<p>That could be true, if he ignores climate change &#8212; everyone will die of the heat, or of starvation, or drown in floods, or get killed by storms, <em>before</em> they have an opportunity to die of infectious disease. Nah, I take that back &#8212; climate disasters will probably kill more people with cholera after the storm/flood/heat wave ends.</p>
<p>Clever move, though, planning to end all the research that would show that Kennedy is an asshat. Maybe even more people will die of ignorance before the viruses and bacteria get them.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="'The Circle of Love' (1917) by Gerda Wegener. Credit: Bridgeman Images" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bal_79151.jpg" height="782" alt="'The Circle of Love' by Gerda Wegener is a painting from 1917 depicting an erotic relationship between two women" width="800"></p> <p>A recent YouGov poll asked Britons about their &ldquo;love language&rdquo;. The survey referred to US author Gary Chapman&rsquo;s concept of the &ldquo;five love languages,&rdquo; which are summarised as quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service and touch. To most British men and women, praise and time together were the preferred ways to feel loved by their partners. But some of the results were strikingly gendered. Over 20 per cent of men placed utmost importance on physical touch, while only 7 per cent of women cared about it. The figures were practically flipped when it came to acts of service, considered to be &ldquo;helping&rdquo; or doing those little things that make someone&rsquo;s life easier.</p> <p>The poll, while not straightforwardly pernicious, is nonetheless problematic. The idea of &ldquo;love languages&rdquo; is a piece of pop psychology, rather than a scientific phenomenon. The results reinforce the idea that, when it comes to love, men value sex, while women value atonement.</p> <p>Historian Eleanor Janega is concerned about the way concepts such as &ldquo;love languages&rdquo; are being co-opted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing a lot of reactionary ideas come to the forefront and a real pushing of the idea that women are first and foremost baby machines, and that we exist in this biological capacity where we are always and for ever at a kind of disadvantage to men,&rdquo; Janega said at the 2 March launch of her latest book, <em>The Once and Future Sex</em>.</p> <p>Misogynist propagandists like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate often push this notion that women are naturally nurturing and subdued beings, corrupted by feminist ideology. Men, in turn, are instinctive, corporeal creatures. In response, Janega decided to do a &ldquo;real deep-dive, historical look at gender&rdquo;, reminding us all that its perceived natures and assigned duties are blatantly socially constructed.</p> <p>For this, she turned to a historic period that is relatively unexamined when it comes to the female perspective, let alone when related to sex and desire. <em>The Once and Future Sex</em> explores the ways in which women were seen in the course of the roughly 1,000 years we call the Middle Ages. Between the fifth and 15th century, the book shows, women weren&rsquo;t seen as inherently frigid homebodies or delusional romantics. As Janega puts it, &ldquo;the majority of recorded European history thinks that women are innately sex-crazed.&rdquo; Similarly, her research shows how the great majority of women in the Middle Ages worked outside the home, in the fields, as shop- or innkeepers, as midwives or maids, or in the many industries and crafts of the period.</p> <p>Women were also not seen as exceptional when holding jobs, even when married with children. In fact, those who could proficiently run household or business accounts and manage staff were understood as assets and better wives. The <em>Once and Future Sex</em> is peppered with such examples and anecdotes, helping us not only humanise our foremothers, but also remember how profoundly historically contextual our ideas of women are. With stories like that of the 15th-century London wool merchant Rose of Burford, who upon her husband&rsquo;s death continued running the business and even settled fiscal arrangements with the crown, or of her French contemporary Christine de Pizan, the court author who wrote the &ldquo;equivalent of a medieval best seller&rdquo;, <em>The Book of the City of Ladies</em>, Janega spurs you on until the final page.</p> <p>Her conclusion is that, while those 1,000 years are indeed the pillars upon which western societies are built, medieval people and their thoughts are not transposable to our times, nor can they possibly serve as illustration to contemporary sexist tropes. On the contrary, as Janega writes, &ldquo;seeing the past and rejecting it allows us to imagine new futures and make the changes that are necessary to create a more equitable world.&rdquo;</p> <p>It is in the spirit of creating a more equitable world that journalist Sophie K. Rosa&rsquo;s debut book <em>Radical Intimacy</em> is written. With great diligence, Rosa goes about exploring the ways in which our socioeconomic system robs us of authentic and liberatory intimacy. The book explores alternative narratives for love and intimacy, reporting on the communities who have over the last century proven that there is life beyond the mainstream norms &ndash; not only when it comes to romance and family, but also wider issues like death and home ownership, friendship, care and solidarity.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s an ambitious book by a great reporter, and the research is exhaustive: from the Gay Liberation Front London communes of the 1970s to today&rsquo;s Campaign for Psych Abolition, fighting against the incarcerating and often punitive nature of psychiatric care. But one keeps wanting to hear Rosa&rsquo;s voice through the beautifully woven stats and quotes. While the introduction feels like a rousing call to arms, the rest of the book reads like a collection of journalistic pieces.</p> <p>Despite their very different topics, Janega and Rosa&rsquo;s books work well in tandem. Where one confronts misinformed tropes with the real lives of women living 500 years ago, the other shows us that there is nothing inevitable about patriarchal or heteronormative relations: we are living side by side with the alternatives.</p> <p>Both prove vital reading in a world struggling for palliative answers and often resorting to regressive ideologies. Both provide hope. And both prove how women do not uniformly fit into the boxes provided by pseudo-scientific theories like the five love languages. Women have been sex workers, sole landowners, squatters, carers, artists, asexual, bisexual, queer or not identifying as women at all. And all these people, past and present, have experienced moments of authenticity and moments of intimacy &ndash; not just in spite of, but often because of, their idiosyncrasies.</p> <p><em>Eleanor Janega's "The Once and Future Sex" is published by W.

Credit: Alamy Stock Photo" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Mussolini.jpg" height="1007" alt="Benito Mussolini stands on a podium in 1935" width="1368"></strong></p> <p><strong>Mussolini in Myth and Memory: The First Totalitarian Dictator</strong> (Oxford University Press) by Paul Corner</p> <p>The United States is not the only democracy flirting with the idea of destroying itself. Russians, Romanians, Italians &ndash; people from all over the world are falling back in love with dictators and dictatorships they fervently rejected not too long ago. Joseph Stalin, declared a criminal by his successors, is now being depicted alongside Vladimir Putin as a strong, feared leader. Nicolae Ceaușescu, who upon his arrest was executed as quickly as possible so he wouldn&rsquo;t be lynched by his own followers, was remembered favourably by 65 per cent of Romanians, according to a 2018 survey. Even Benito Mussolini, whose mutilated body was hung upside down at the Piazzale Loreto in Milan, somehow managed to gain the sympathy of the children and grandchildren of the Italians who celebrated his death.</p> <p>How did we get here? Using Italy as a case study, Paul Corner&rsquo;s <em>Mussolini in Myth and Memory </em>argues it all comes down to collective memory, the way it forms and is manipulated. Faced with problems like economic recession, political instability and changing social norms, people seek refuge in &ldquo;phantom utopias&rdquo;: augmented versions of the past in which memories of violence and suppression are themselves suppressed. Corner builds on ideas introduced by Russian sociologist Lev Gudkov (&ldquo;Soviet ideological slogans get reborn in the mass consciousness, but are mistaken for a reality &ndash; a phantom utopia &ndash; that never existed&rdquo;) and filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini (&ldquo;We are a country without memory, which is like saying without history. Italy removes its recent past&hellip; keeping only those memories, those fragments that might be useful for its contortions, its conversions&rdquo;) to create an original, insightful study of the 20th century and its aftermath.</p> <p>Each chapter identifies a popular misconception about Mussolini&rsquo;s rule, discerns the purpose it serves in present-day Italy and gathers historical evidence to show why it is incorrect. Examples include: Mussolini made the trains run on time; Mussolini destroyed the mafia; siding with Nazi Germany was Mussolini&rsquo;s one key mistake; and Mussolini alone bears responsibility for Italy&rsquo;s actions before and during the Second World War. The notion that Mussolini reduced crime betrays frustration with the slow-moving administration of justice in bureaucratic democracies, just as the belief that Mussolini introduced pensions is rooted in financial insecurity. In truth, writes Corner, there is no evidence to suggest he made Italy less criminal, and while his regime did extend pensions, the foundations of those systems were put in place long before he rose to power. The misconception that Mussolini is responsible for Italy&rsquo;s actions is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it absolves Italians from the guilt of the war crimes they committed. On the other, it reinforces the image of Mussolini as all-powerful.</p> <p>Corner admittedly focuses more on the past than the present &ndash; a bit disappointing considering the book&rsquo;s title promises readers they will learn how the former is contained in the latter. Instead of merely reframing the work of other historians, it would have been fitting to see him devote a bit more time and energy to those aspects that make<em> Mussolini in Myth and Memory</em> unique. But popular opinion on Mussolini &ndash; or any other subject &ndash; is difficult to pin down without resorting to surveys and statistical research, which would have slowed the book&rsquo;s arresting pace.</p> <p>If you want to get a better understanding of the rise, fall and persistence of fascism, this is a good book to start with. Corner&rsquo;s central theme of collective memory and phantom utopias gives the reader a theoretical framework through which to organise information provided by other, more conventional studies. Corner, who served as the director of the Centre for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes in Siena, is doing more than fact-checking fake news. His is a study of how fake news &ndash; for lack of a better term &ndash; enters the world and warps it accordingly.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here for access to the full magazine</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="'Old Man in Sorrow' by Vincent van Gogh. Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/CRKX0E.jpg" height="1890" alt="'Old Man in Sorrow' by Vincent van Gogh" width="1519"></p> <p>In November 1901 a woman named Auguste Deter was admitted to the Municipal Asylum for Epileptics and Lunatics in Frankfurt. She was 51 years old. Paranoid delusions about her husband&rsquo;s fidelity had given way to amnesia and disorientation; she failed to recognise old friends and forgot life&rsquo;s daily occurrences the moment they were past. Soon she was unable to look after herself entirely. &ldquo;I have lost myself,&rdquo; she told her 36-year-old physician. His name was Dr Alois Alzheimer.</p> <p>Alzheimer was that rare thing at the turn of the 20th century, a doctor with an interest in both psychiatry, the workings of the mind, and histology, the study of cell tissue and structure. When he examined Deter&rsquo;s brain after her eventual death in 1906, he found it alarmingly atrophied, abnormally light. Then, looking at it under the microscope, he saw two things he had never seen before. First, the buildup of a brain protein named beta-amyloid into what are known as &ldquo;senile plaques&rdquo;; second, dense tangles of fibrils within the brain&rsquo;s cells that had gone rogue, as it were, choking and ultimately destroying the cells themselves. The damage was greatest where the tangles and the plaques coincided. As many as a third of the cells in Deter&rsquo;s cerebral cortex were destroyed or damaged.</p> <p>If it seems paradoxical that one of the definitive diseases of old age should have been first identified in someone much younger, Alzheimer himself regarded his discovery as a disease of middle age and entirely distinct from senile dementia. It was a view that held until the 1970s, when it became clear that they were essentially the same phenomenon; the neurologist Robert Katzman showed that Alzheimer&rsquo;s was one of the leading causes of death in the US, its presence in the deceased elided by a wide range of more immediately catastrophic health events recorded on the death certificate.</p> <p>Somehow it seems apt for Alzheimer&rsquo;s to be hiding in plain sight like that. It is after all a disease of deception, its presence masked in the patient by the general cognitive decline that we all experience once we pass the age of 50 or so. This can be compounded by the patient&rsquo;s own unwillingness or inability to recognise or acknowledge the disease as it encroaches, and by the person&rsquo;s stubborn, desperate retention of routine and behaviour &ndash; even while memory and, arguably, identity crumble around them.</p> <p>My father died of Alzheimer&rsquo;s three days after his 90th birthday in May 2016. He had been admitted with sepsis four days earlier, but his renal functions had been failing, resulting in repeated spells in hospital, since the previous autumn. There was one long spell of about a month in the spring from which he never really rallied. All semblance of independent life ended. There were four 15-minute visits from health workers spread across the empty plain of the day, and then soon a nurse staying overnight in case he accidentally pulled his catheter out &ndash; and, more generally, to comfort a newfound panic that overwhelmed him when he was alone, particularly at night.</p> <p>It can&rsquo;t have been much more than a week into this new restricted life that he stopped coming downstairs, or even getting out of bed. He ate less and less. By this time he was incontinent as well as cathetered and had lost any sense of the indignity of the experience, lost his sense of privacy, of decency, of inhibition. He would have been appalled, had he known. He was, I would have said, a proud man; he wanted to live in his home of 50 years on his own terms. The change was disorienting. A few weeks earlier, in hospital, he had to be physically restrained by two security guards to stop him discharging himself against medical advice. Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards were invoked. He was sedated. Most of that fight seemed to have drained away. It&rsquo;s tempting to say that he gave up the ghost: it implies a degree of agency and choice on his part, and the dignity that goes with a sense of volition. It&rsquo;s impossible to know if that is actually true; but it is comforting, in a small way, to think it might be.</p> <h2>The role of loneliness</h2> <p>Memory plays tricks on all of us. Or rather, we conspire with it in a process that psychologists call &ldquo;coherence&rdquo;, shaping memories to fit narratives we find more comfortable, or that accommodate our present sense of self better. My recollection is that Dad&rsquo;s difficulties date to the last couple of years of his life, but going back through the emails between myself and my three siblings to research this piece, I see that we had serious concerns about his memory at least as far back as 2011. Perhaps I want to avoid thinking about ways in which those last years might have been better for him. Perhaps we should have pushed him harder to recognise his predicament. But would the emotional distress, never mind the potential of ruptured familial relationships, have been worth the cost? It is not as if it is a disease with a cure. Perhaps he was already, in some senses, unreachable.</p> <p>Our mother had died of esophageal cancer early in 2009, and grief, loneliness and depression weighed heavily on my father. I don&rsquo;t think it was a sorrow he ever had the wherewithal to adapt to, never mind overcome. He was prescribed citalopram, an anti-depressant, but we were never sure how reliably he took it. We were never sure how reliably he took any medication in those years. He bristled at the intrusion whenever we enquired; the irritation, touched with defensiveness, was entirely in character, but I wonder now how much that kind of sensitivity, possibly extending to resentment, was related to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s. The hippocampus nestles beside the amygdala in the brain, and the amygdala regulates the great primal emotions.</p> <p>Perhaps it was a function of the disease too, then, that he seemed to be more emotional about Mum&rsquo;s loss the longer it receded into the past. When we all met on the anniversary of Mum&rsquo;s death, or on her birthday, on the hillside where we had scattered her ashes, Dad took to throwing himself to the ground and kissing the earth where the ashes had fallen. Hitherto, he had been among the most reserved of people; the only time I ever saw him express intense physical affection for Mum was at her death, when he showered her cold face with kisses and sobbed.</p> <p>Looking back now, I can see that Dad&rsquo;s situation was fertile ground for Alzheimer&rsquo;s to take root in.</p> <p>Sandeep Jauhar&rsquo;s new book, <em>My Father&rsquo;s Brain</em>, is a moving account of his father&rsquo;s illness and eventual death. Like my own father, Jauhar&rsquo;s had lost his wife a few years earlier; like Dad, too, he had a successful career in which intellect played a key role. He cites a 2007 study which suggests there is a strong correlation between loneliness and the development of Alzheimer&rsquo;s; and another, from 2020, which found that the recently widowed decline mentally three times as quickly as those who have not experienced such wrenching, disabling griefs.</p> <p>I wish I had known about that correlation. But I don&rsquo;t know how easy it would have been to make use of it. It&rsquo;s sometimes said that Alzheimer&rsquo;s destroys the self. Ultimately, perhaps, it does, if the patient lives long enough to reach the final stage where the disease attacks not just memory but motor function, the ability to undertake such fundamental tasks as swallowing. Dad died before he reached that extremity. I think we must be grateful for that. In one moment of clarity in those last weeks, he described the disease to me as a kind of hollowing out; he said he looked inside himself and found a blackness, as if what remained of memory and the self clung vertiginously to the outer limits of his identity. I think it terrified him. Looking back, though, what feels remarkable is not the loss of self, but its persistence.</p> <h2>Memory and the self</h2> <p>The relationship between memory and the self has long been argued over. Jauhar notes the 18th-century philosopher David Hume&rsquo;s observation in his <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em> that &ldquo;Had we no memory, we never should have any notion of causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and effects, which constitute our self or person.&rdquo; Late in life the surrealist film maker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel wrote poignantly in his memoir <em>My Last Breath</em>: &ldquo;You have to begin to lose your memory, if only in bits and pieces, to realise that memory is what makes our lives. Life without memory is no life&hellip; Our memory is our coherence, our reason, our feeling, even our action. Without it, we are nothing.&rdquo; But are we only the sum of our own memories? Does the self only have meaning in terms of the interior life? &ldquo;The conventional paradigm about what constitutes a person does not give adequate import to the richness of a human being outside of his cognitive capacities,&rdquo; Jauhar writes. &ldquo;Human beings exist not only in an inner world but also in a public space. It is that space that continues to give meaning to the lives of people living with severe dementia.&rdquo;</p> <p>It&rsquo;s an idea also explored in another new book on the subject, Dasha Kiper&rsquo;s <em>Travellers to Unimaginable Lands</em>, a psychologically acute and compelling series of case studies exploring the relationship between the carer and the dementia patient. &ldquo;The notion that there is a part of ourselves that is entirely separate from others is most likely a fiction,&rdquo; she writes. There is no &ldquo;us&rdquo; that is distinct from &ldquo;how people see us&rdquo;. &ldquo;Neurologically speaking, there is no special place in the brain that is hermetically sealed from the influence of other people. Quite the contrary: the self is porous.&rdquo;</p> <p>A related theme in Kiper&rsquo;s book resonated powerfully with me: the idea that Alzheimer&rsquo;s is emotionally and mentally disabling for the carer, as well as the patient. &ldquo;We simply have no cognitive framework that allows for [memory&rsquo;s] absence in others,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;Human beings did not evolve to function in isolation, and in fact each person&rsquo;s cognition is dependent on the cognitive faculties of those around them. So when one person&rsquo;s memory is impaired, those close to him or her also become disoriented.&rdquo; That is, Alzheimer&rsquo;s bends the world to its rhythms and processes. It&rsquo;s quite totalitarian in this regard. Alternate realities &ndash; narratives, perspectives, points of view &ndash; are not viable.</p> <h2>Extraordinary intimacies</h2> <p>To accompany a loved one into the horror of Alzheimer&rsquo;s is to negotiate extraordinary intimacies at the limit of human experience to which you are the only witness. You have to keep privately reminding yourself what is occurring, what has occurred. Your memory of events becomes a kind of private resistance to the disease. But in the public space between you and the patient, Alzheimer&rsquo;s obliterates you too. Faced, say, with endlessly repeated questions or statements, you can tell the truth and say, &ldquo;We just talked about that&rdquo;. But it won&rsquo;t change the sequence of events. Or you can acquiesce, play the game as it were, and respond to each moment as if it is new to you too. Either way, Alzheimer&rsquo;s wins. Its reality trumps your reality.</p> <p>&ldquo;In the end,&rdquo; a neurologist tells Jauhar, &ldquo;all dementias look alike. The whole brain is affected. Patients generally can&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo; But the journey to that end is surely unique &ndash; or as unique as the person for whom you are caring, as unique as your relationship with them. In the same way as my relationship with my dad was not the same as his with each of my siblings, however much common ground we shared, I am sure my experience of his Alzheimer&rsquo;s was different, because it was grounded in the deep memory of our prior history. Alzheimer&rsquo;s strips away almost everything that is individual. But even when language and memory failed Dad the most, there were still the bare, non-verbal, human things of touch and companionship, comfort and care which we gave him, each as we could: a kind of somatic continuity to counterbalance the strobing discontinuous struggle of surviving as each brief moment of existence flashed past unremarked to make way for the next. I don&rsquo;t know if it mattered to him; it felt very much like it did. What does it matter if he didn&rsquo;t remember afterwards?</p> <p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s, writes David Shenk in his classic study <em>The Forgetting</em>, &ldquo;is not only a disease, but also a prism through which we can view life in a way not normally available to us&hellip; it forces us to experience death in a way it is rarely otherwise experienced&hellip; It is more painful than many people can even imagine, but it is also perhaps the most poignant of all reminders of why and how human life is so extraordinary. It is our best lens on the meaning of loss.&rdquo; We are social animals. We need community, even if that is a community of two people. We need reciprocity, a sense of the shared moment. But reciprocity requires a mutual understanding. What happens then if there is only one person to understand, to remember?</p> <p>As a historian, as a writer, I think a lot about memory and erasure, memory and loss. Absences in the record. The value of testimony. The sense of my father&rsquo;s life &ndash; all those unshared, unwritten memories flaking away, falling into oblivion in those last months, perhaps years &ndash; was almost palpable. But if the self is not limited to the individual memory, if it is in some senses a shared construct, a shared endeavour, then it is important to rescue what can still be rescued, and not to write off the ends of life, to compound one erasure with another.</p> <p>Towards the end of the 20th century there was a sometimes vituperative debate about the historiography of the Holocaust. Put very crudely, the argument was about whether it is possible even to write history about such a subject: narrative history is inevitably selective, cohering to an argument, and ultimately a kind of falsification, the thinking runs. Critics of this position saw it as an attack on the status of survivor testimony that opened the door to Holocaust revisionism and denial. The Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg&rsquo;s contribution was an essay titled &ldquo;Just One Witness&rdquo;. He begins by citing the extermination of the entire Jewish community in a village in Provence in 1348, in the wake of the Black Death, for which the only evidence now is the written memory of a single survivor. We cannot, as historians, disregard such testimony, he argues, even if there is nothing reciprocal in the record to confirm it. It exists; we must make sense of it.</p> <p>That essay, or its core sentiment, has been rattling around my head writing this. For all the grinding bewilderment and exhaustion of those months, there is a kind of privilege to care for someone in these straits. A privilege to travel with someone into such a bleak, strange part of human existence. To travel with them, and bring the last of them back with you. Two people, one supporting the other. One community of two. One witness. One love.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Nuclear fusion is the power source of the sun and the stars. Image credit: Andrey Grinkevich" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/andrey-grinkevich-0x6RTts1jRU-unsplash.jpg" height="1080" alt="A bright yellow sun rises over mountains in Nevada" width="1920"></p> <p>There has been a lot of excitement lately about harnessing nuclear fusion, the power source of the sun and stars, and so gaining access to limitless green energy. Is it all hype? Well, put it this way. The joke since the 1950s has been that commercial fusion is always 50 years away. Now it appears to be only 30 years away!</p> <p>So, what is this promising process, able to produce abundant energy without greenhouse gases? Readers may be more familiar with nuclear fission, the process behind the atomic bomb and nuclear reactors, which involves splitting the core, or &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo;, of a heavy atom, to make lighter nuclei. In nuclear fusion, light nuclei are melded together to make a heavier one. When light nuclei like hydrogen fuse, or heavy nuclei like uranium split, surplus energy gushes out. Pound for pound, a nuclear fuel contains at least a million times as much energy as a &ldquo;chemical fuel&rdquo; like coal or oil.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why nuclear fusion is so attractive, but let&rsquo;s look at the practicalities. The sun fuses hydrogen into helium, with the by-product being sunlight, but the reaction is far too slow for use on Earth. Instead, the focus has been on gluing together deuterium (a heavy form of hydrogen that is readily available in seawater) with tritium (an even heavier but fast-decaying form, which has to be created by artificial nuclear reactions).</p> <p>The difficulty with fusion is that light nuclei like hydrogen need to be slammed together extremely violently in order to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion, which is ferocious. Such collisions in practice occur only at an extremely high temperature. But, whereas the fusion of hydrogen in the sun requires a temperature of 15 million degrees, the fusion of deuterium and tritium requires a temperature of more than 100 million degrees.</p> <p>And herein lies the problem. How do you generate such extraordinary temperatures on Earth without destroying everything in the vicinity?</p> <p>There are two main approaches. One is to confine a super-hot &ldquo;plasma&rdquo; of deuterium and tritium by means of powerful magnetic fields in a machine with a doughnut or &ldquo;torus&rdquo; shape. The other is to compress and heat peppercorn-sized pellets of deuterium and tritium, one after another, by hitting them from all sides with mega-lasers.</p> <p>Both fusion methods have scored significant successes of late, which is the reason for the current excitement. In December 2021, at Culham near Oxford, the Joint European Torus (JET) maintained the necessary fusion temperature for 5 seconds. Crucially, 59 million joules of energy more than was put in came out &ndash; enough to boil about 60 kettles. A year later, the US National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California got out 1.1 million joules more than it put in.</p> <p>These are undoubtedly milestones on the way to a commercial fusion reactor, but there is a long journey ahead to scale up the technology. JET&rsquo;s successor, the impressively huge International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, funded by 35 countries, is currently under construction in Southern France. But it will be only a test reactor, not a commercial reactor. And if laser-based, or &ldquo;inertial&rdquo;, fusion is ever to be viable, it will need to be able to induce fusion in not just one pellet but several pellets every second.</p> <p>Currently, it is immensely hard to make a pellet that is perfectly spherical enough that it implodes sufficiently uniformly to create the necessary fusion temperatures. The cost per pellet will also need to come down from its current level of a few hundred thousand dollars to a few tens of cents. The challenges are substantial, but so is the promised reward: unlimited energy from seawater, one of the most abundant resources on the planet, with no greenhouse gases generated, at least not directly.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s important to be clear when it comes to green credentials. It is not quite true that nuclear fusion has no radioactive waste problems. Neutrons escaping from the fusion reactions cannot be confined by magnetic fields, on account of being electrically neutral, and will inevitably make the material of any containment vessel radioactive. Fusion proponents, however, say the radioactivity will not be as long-lived and problematic as from fission reactors.</p> <p>If all goes to plan, a new era of clean and plentiful energy will dawn in the 2050s, with the construction of the first commercial fusion reactors. Unless, of course, some unexpected hitch occurs, flipping that horizon back to its perennial 50-year state.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

              <h2><a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6131/book-review-surrender-by-bono#utm_source=rss">Book review: Surrender by Bono</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Our reviewer hopes for a second volume" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bono.jpg" height="748" alt="The cover art for 'Surrender' includes a black and white, close-up photo of Bono as a younger man" width="500"></p> <p><strong>Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story</strong> (Hutchinson Heinemann) by Bono</p> <p>All rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll memoirs are the telling of a miracle. If a musician has succeeded to the point that anybody believes their memoir worth publishing, they have triumphed over the colossal odds that stand against any bunch of earnest, spotty youths, feeling their way around instruments they can barely play, ever amounting to anything much.</p> <p>The story related by U2 frontman Bono in <em>Surrender</em>, as its author understands, is remarkable even by that measure. The chances of Dublin teenagers gathering to make a racket in a suburban kitchen in 1976 becoming, within a decade or so, the biggest rock band in the world were virtually nil.</p> <p><em>Surrender</em> is a series of recollections and digressions attached to 40 songs from U2&rsquo;s catalogue. Though the book is more or less chronological, each chapter feels self-contained: a sketch, a parable, a confession and/or a funny story. Over the course of a long and extraordinary career, Bono has amassed a wealth of anecdotage. He relates his material with the instinctive skill of a born yarn-spinner, and an air of self-deprecating befuddlement that any of this somehow happened. There were, of course, any number of reasons why it shouldn&rsquo;t have.</p> <p>But it did. So, Mikhail Gorbachev pitches up on his Dublin doorstep clutching an enormous teddy bear. George W. Bush gives him something of a wigging in the Oval Office. He gets repeatedly out-drunk by Frank Sinatra. He relates his encounters with the elites of entertainment, politics, tech, media and finance with deftly turned character portraits. Rupert Murdoch is &ldquo;a sophisticated thinker, camouflaged by colloquialisms; Australian&rdquo;, Nelson Mandela is &ldquo;a wellspring of joy that defied the weight he carried&rdquo;, Johnny Cash &ldquo;the heavyweight champion of every room he entered except the one that contained June Carter&rdquo;.</p> <p>There is an echo in the latter aper&ccedil;u of another key theme of <em>Surrender</em>. It is a book about women, although not in the way that memoirs by male rock stars often are. Specifically, it is to a large extent a book about two women. One is Iris Hewson, Bono&rsquo;s mother, who died suddenly when Bono was 14: a recurring motif of <em>Surrender</em>, as it is of U2&rsquo;s catalogue, is Bono grappling with the uncomfortable thought that this tragedy might somehow have catalysed his success. The other is Ali Hewson, Bono&rsquo;s wife: the pair met at school, and married in their early 20s. Bono still sounds like a man touchingly terrified of what might have become of him otherwise.</p> <p><em>Surrender</em> is not merely a great memoir by the usually lackadaisical standards of rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll autobiography. It&rsquo;s a great book about music and politics, family and friendship, pride and ambition, and doesn&rsquo;t wear thin even at nearly 600 pages. Indeed, there are sufficient omissions &ndash; and certainly enough U2 songs &ndash; to warrant a second volume.</p> <p>As someone present at both extraordinary occasions, I was surprised to find little reference to U2&rsquo;s show at Ko&scaron;evo Stadium in Sarajevo in 1997, 18 months after the lifting of the siege of the city, or their three-night stand at Madison Square Garden in New York in 2001, six weeks after 9/11 &ndash; events at which U2&rsquo;s rare gift for channelling a moment triumphed in difficult, volatile circumstances which most bands of their stature might have preferred not to confront.</p> <p>Some of the most interesting stretches of <em>Surrender</em> are those that reflect on the conundrums and contradictions which arise when one attempts to apply the idealism of rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll to the realities of politics. In both realms, Bono talks about the search for the &ldquo;top-line melody&rdquo;, the irresistible riff that lodges an idea, a sentiment, a mood in people&rsquo;s heads, and sends them away humming it whether they really want to or not.</p> <p>To a degree confounding its title, <em>Surrender</em> serves as a brisk primer in the art of getting stuff actually done. It turns out to necessitate much the same boneheaded determination and unwillingness to shut up that drive a teenager aboard the boat-train from Dublin to London to spend days schlepping from indifferent promoter to baffled journalist with a demo tape. Though U2&rsquo;s songs have not been short on utopian sloganeering, especially early on, their singer evolved into a pragmatic and effective advocate, and <em>Surrender</em> is also the story of a political education, as instructed by many of the most influential figures of our time.</p> <p>I did once ask Bono if he entertained any ambitions of political office himself, and suggested that Ireland&rsquo;s largely ceremonial presidency might be suitable; he replied that he wouldn&rsquo;t want to move to a smaller house. Like many of his insights into the absurdity and opportunity of an unlikely life as a mega-celebrity, it&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s true.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here for access to the full magazine</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->
