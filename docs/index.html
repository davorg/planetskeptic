<p class="lead">We all have lots to worry about already, with pandemics and climate change and political crises and growing irrationality, but one I&#8217;m increasingly alarmed by is the popularity of these pseudo-intellectual frauds parading about as &#8220;longtermists&#8221; or &#8220;effective altruists&#8221; who believe we should be worshipping potential future generations rather than dealing with real people in the here and now. It leads to distorted priorities. It doesn&#8217;t help that their thought-leaders are cocky ignoramuses. Émile P. Torres writes about <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/11/what-longtermism-gets-wrong-about-climate-change/">William MacAskill&#8217;s opinion of the importance of climate change</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>One finds the same insouciant attitude about climate change in MacAskill’s recent book. For example, he notes that there is a lot of uncertainty about the impacts of extreme warming of 7 to 10 degrees Celsius but says “it’s hard to see how even this could lead directly to civilisational collapse.” MacAskill argues that although “climatic instability is generally bad for agriculture,” his “best guess” is that “even with fifteen degrees of warming, the heat would not pass lethal limits for crops in most regions,” and global agriculture would survive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a climate scientist, but I know a number of them, and follow the work, and that statement is jaw-droppingly idiotic. Even with the amount of warming we&#8217;ve got now, we&#8217;ve had heat waves that kill large numbers of people, and this past year has seen a series of <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/09/climate-change-global-warming-extreme-climate-disasters-2022/">extreme weather disasters</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Record-breaking heat waves baked India and Pakistan, then monsoon flooding left about a third of Pakistan under water, affecting an estimated 33 million people. Temperatures exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) for prolonged periods in many places, and even broke 122 F (50 C) in Jacobabad, Pakistan, in May.</p>
<p>The Asian heat helped to melt some glaciers in the Himalayas, elevating rivers. At the same time, three times the normal annual rain fell in Pakistan during the weekslong monsoon. More than 1,500 people died in the flooding, an estimated 1.8 million homes were damaged or destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of livestock were lost. Food for the coming seasons will be in short supply.</p>
<p>Extreme heat in Europe led to wildfires, especially in Spain and Portugal. The drought in Spain dried up a reservoir, revealing the long-submerged “Spanish Stonehenge,” an ancient circle of megalithic stones believed to date back to around 5000 B.C. Electricity generation in France plummeted, with low rivers reducing the ability to cool nuclear power towers, and German barges had difficulty finding enough water to navigate the Rhine River.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s just this year! And the trend is ever upwards! Keep in mind that when climate experts tell you they&#8217;re concerned about a 3 degree rise, they&#8217;re looking at the <em>mean</em> temperature…and the extremes will be far worse. It&#8217;s the extremes that kill people and devastate regions, not the mean.</p>
<p>Yet here&#8217;s MacAskill blithely claiming that a <em>FIFTEEN FUCKING DEGREE rise</em> would be acceptable. Agriculture would survive, he thinks, so we&#8217;d be OK. Never mind the floods &#038; fires &#038; storms &#038; mass upheaval &#038; total disruption &#038; civilization collapse. William MacAskill thinks he&#8217;ll still get his corn flakes every morning.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t listen to me. Torres contacted real climatologists about that claim.</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, I shared the section about global agriculture with Timothy Lenton, who directs the Global Systems Institute and is Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter. Lenton told me that MacAskill’s assertion about 15 degrees of warming is “complete nonsense—we already show that in a 3-degree-warmer world there are major challenges of moving niches for human habitability and agriculture.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Luke Kemp, a research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk who recently co-authored an article with Lenton on catastrophic climate change and is an expert on civilizational collapse, told me that “a temperature rise of 10 degrees would be a mass extinction event in the long term. It would be geologically unprecedented in speed. It would mean billions of people facing sustained lethal heat conditions, the likely displacement of billions, the Antarctic becoming virtually ice-free, surges in disease, and a plethora of cascading impacts. Confidently asserting that this would not result in collapse because agriculture is still possible in some parts of the world is silly and simplistic.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If we&#8217;re really worried about existential risk and the possible extinction of the human species, I say we need to tar and feather these longtermist fantasists and launch them on a rail to the moon. It looks like delusional crackpots are going to kill us all.</p>
<p>Fifteen degrees. My god, that&#8217;s insane.</p>

<p class="lead">Peter Thiel funded it. Candace Owens promoted it. I had never heard of this GloriFi bank until it collapsed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s whole deal was that it was &#8220;anti-woke,&#8221; whatever that means. Since it was run by a gang of rabid capitalists who didn&#8217;t know what &#8220;woke&#8221; means, that doesn&#8217;t matter. What it really was was an <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90815800/freedom-loving-pro-america-fintech-startup-glorifi-is-shutting-down">ideologically driven attempt to prove that conservative principles were profitable and practical</a>. They weren&#8217;t.</p>
<blockquote><p>As The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on GloriFi’s shuttering, puts it, the business was “anti-woke.” While GloriFi itself never publicly described itself as anti-woke, the company had no qualms about marketing itself as a service provider for right-wing America. In a July press release, the company described itself as  “a pro-freedom, pro-America, pro-capitalism technology company . . . empowering members to put their money where their values are and preserve the Country they believe in.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, its foundation was built on <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/anti-woke-bank-glorifi-shuts-down-1234634682/">far-right paranoia and their bizarre obsessions</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pitching itself as a financial institution that allowed one to be “free to celebrate your love of God and country without fear of cancellation,” GloriFi’s marketing read more like a campaign ad than an enticing APR offer on a new credit card. Highlights from the “about us” page include: “OUR BILL OF RIGHTS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE” and “WE ARE ONE NATION UNDER GOD.” </p>
<p>In its short tenure GloriFi, managed to launch checking and savings accounts as well as credit cards, with plans to offer mortgages and insurance in a future that will no longer take place. Founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer pitched plans to offer gun owners discounts on home insurance, credit cards made of shell casing material, and assistance paying legal bills if customers shot someone in self-defense. Over the summer, GloriFi secured conservative commentator Candace Owens as a co-founder and spokesperson for the brand. </p></blockquote>
<p>Guys. Guys. GUYS. I know this is news to you, but regular banks won&#8217;t cancel your account if you announce that you love god and America. That&#8217;s not a sound basis for differentiating yourself from the competition. In fact, it makes you look weird, and especially stuff like the special privileges for gun-owners and people who shoot other people was probably counter to profitability. Having a controversial freak like Candace Owens (what? Laura Loomer was unavailable?) as the face of your company didn&#8217;t project seriousness, either.</p>
<p>Predictably, it imploded.</p>
<blockquote><p>But GloriFi was unable to translate ideological grandstanding into functional corporate management. Even before its public launch, the startup was plagued by reports of chaos amongst staff and financiers. GloriFi missed its planned launch date several times, at one point due to clashes with Texas financial regulators. Reports emerged of unpaid invoices and erratic behavior from Neugebauer, who had converted his home Dallas mansion into the company’s main office. </p>
<p>According to the Journal, the company was eventually forced to hire a law firm to investigate workplace issues, particularly around Neugebauer. In one memo reviewed by the Journal, GloriFi’s former Head of Human Resources Britt Amos described several employees at Neugebaur’s mansion telling him to “make sure I leave around six,” and explaining that “after 5 p.m. Toby starts drinking and things at the house deteriorate quickly.” Amos also described a meeting where a visibly drunk Neugebauer was “drinking Red Bull and putting alcohol in it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You know, being &#8220;woke&#8221; just means you&#8217;re aware of the social shortcomings of the existing system, and are concerned about fairness and equality. Declaring yourself &#8220;anti-woke&#8221; implies that you&#8217;re ignorant of reality and want a system that will screw people over, things I do not want in a financial institution.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="K-pop band BTS are kings of South Korea's soft power" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/BTS.jpeg" height="585" alt="K-pop group BTS" width="1024"></p> <p class="p1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Gangnam Style&rsquo; is a socio-cultural commentary on South Korea&rsquo;s hyper-consumerism and material pursuit&rdquo; reads the label next to a glass case containing a pink suit. The outfit belongs to the pop star Psy, who made the song and accompanying dance world famous (the &ldquo;Gangnam Style&rdquo; music video was the first YouTube clip to earn over a billion views). That was back in 2012. Now Korean popular culture &ndash; the <em>hallyu</em> or so-called Korean Wave &ndash; has earned its own exhibition in the UK&rsquo;s prestigious V&amp;A Museum in London.</p> <p class="p2">There is something delightful about imagining the curators working out how to word the labels for this collection of artefacts: a range of early video games reveals the pioneering spirit of early web caf&eacute; culture, cute outfits like Psy&rsquo;s are displayed, while their pop songs play on multiple screens. The exhibition sums up K-pop as: &ldquo;adored worldwide for its polished performances that blend catchy tunes and heartening lyrics, stunning visuals and powerful dance steps.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p2">You may not need the V&amp;A to tell you that K-pop now has a global reach, or to recognise the faces of these pretty, androgynous stars. In October, the BBC World Service led with news that the members of BTS &ndash; the south Korean boy band &ndash; were going to do their military service and would not be exempt. The possibility had been discussed, due to their contribution to Korea&rsquo;s global standing; they have even addressed the United Nations general assembly.</p> <p class="p2">South Korea has not just re-branded itself, but built global economic success on its popular culture. Given that the three decades after the Korean War ended in 1953 were marked by political repression meted out by the paramilitary government, this was a remarkable transformation. In the 1990s, South Korea transitioned from autocracy to democracy. The strategy of promoting culture appears to have been triggered by striking economic data: in 1993, the film <em>Jurassic Park</em> earned more money in South Korea than the major car manufacturer Hyundai. One can&rsquo;t help wondering if this promotion of culture might also have helped to harness the energy of South Korea&rsquo;s young population, and embed its new democratic identity.</p> <p class="p2">The success of South Korea&rsquo;s policy extends to cinema (Oscar-winning <em>Parasite</em> and <em>Minari</em>) and television (<em>Squid</em> <em>Game</em>), following years of critical acclaim for directors such as Park Chan Wook (<em>Oldboy</em>) and Bong Joon-ho, whose films <em>The Host</em> and <em>Snowpiercer</em> won him global fans before <em>Parasite</em> got its three Oscars.</p> <p class="p2">Is there a lesson for the UK? Cultural leaders in Britain from screen, stage and the music industry have been pleading for years for the Conservative government to recognise the significant value of the export earnings of British culture, along with the boon to tourism. They pleaded for better support for the arts during the pandemic lockdowns, only to be answered by the government&rsquo;s much-mocked skills retraining poster campaign, apparently suggesting that ballet dancers might instead find a job &ldquo;in cyber&rdquo;, whatever that might mean.</p> <p class="p2">Education policy, too, has been re-angled to emphasise the funding of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) as if they were in a competition with the humanities. Music, drama and language provision in state schools is plummeting. All of which gives the impression that the British government is either oblivious or tone deaf to the economic value of our creative industries.</p> <p class="p4">That&rsquo;s not to say all is rosy in the world of the Korean Wave. K-pop acts are formed like a factory product: from their teenage years, artists are drilled and groomed into a uniform standard of beauty. While the likes of BTS may be speaking up about climate change and LGBTQ+ pride, there is something unsettling about the image of perfection their fans aspire to emulate.</p> <p class="p2">South Korea is a world leader in something less savoury than cultural exports, too. It has the highest rate of cosmetic surgeries in the world, with an estimated one in three South Korean women under 30 having procedures.</p> <p class="p2">Even so, there is a frankness in South Korean culture about the dark side of its success. One of the most powerful exhibits in the V&amp;A exhibition is the ugly set of the basement flat from <em>Parasite</em> &ndash; semi-underground &ndash; typical of those in which many poor urban families live.</p> <p class="p2">What is inspiring is how South Korea has dared to see the value of storytelling and song. The country has built a cultural and economic force out of the power of its citizens to dream; whatever darkness, as well as beauty, those dreams might reveal.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

              <h2><a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6044/swedens-summer-of-hate#utm_source=rss">Sweden's summer of hate</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/HW4X8M.jpg" height="748" alt="Cyclists in Stockholm" width="1289"></p> <p class="p1">On a hot June day in the Swedish sub-arctic, the smell of pine combined with dust from the freshly dug soil. Here on the edge of the small city of Ume&aring;, squeezed between a hockey stadium and the end of the airport runway, I met locals and refugees who had come together to grow fruit and vegetables. The project is part of an organisation called Friends in Ume&aring;, a grassroots network of volunteers that organises everything from jogging sessions to gardening and games nights, helping new arrivals adapt to a region where, in the winter, there are just three hours of daylight and temperatures regularly dip below minus ten. </p> <p class="p3">One of the project&rsquo;s success stories is Samir. Originally from Iraq, he came to Sweden in 2015 and now works at the local Volvo plant. He is also honorary taxi driver to the other volunteers, ferrying people around in his pristine estate car. The north of Sweden is a place of opportunity for those who make their homes here, and in Ume&aring;, Somalians, Iraqis and Syrians are an important part of the small city&rsquo;s increasingly international outlook.</p> <p class="p3">As they worked on their vegetable patch in 31 degree heat, the refugees did not know it yet, but their situation was about to get worse. Twelve weeks later, when Sweden went to the polls, the far-right party, the Sweden Democrats (SD), would achieve unprecedented power. The biggest party in Sweden&rsquo;s right-wing group, the far-right upstarts have risen from rank outsiders to become the second biggest party in the country. They are now crucial partners to its ruling Conservative coalition government.</p> <h2 class="p3">Sweden's political crisis</h2> <p class="p3">The rise of the Sweden Democrats has forced Swedes and the rest of Europe to reconsider Sweden&rsquo;s reputation as a tolerant society and a safe haven for refugees. In a warning to supposedly stable democracies, a country that was long seen as Europe&rsquo;s progressive beacon has proven itself just as susceptible to the siren calls of far-right populism as any other. With links to Viktor Orb&aacute;n&rsquo;s Fidesz movement and Georgia Meloni&rsquo;s Brothers of Italy, the SD have made Islamic migrants scapegoats for Sweden&rsquo;s growing inequality and spikes in violent crime. Following a record-breaking election in which they got 20 per cent of the vote, they now pull the strings as part of a co-operation agreement with the traditional conservative bloc.</p> <p class="p3">Former refugees like Samir may be safe: with permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship he is beyond the reach of the immigration system. But the Friends in Ume&aring; work with others who are not so lucky. Hussein lives in a modest apartment on the city&rsquo;s fringe and makes a living mowing lawns and pruning hedges for wealthy Swedes. He is one of thousands of refugees granted asylum but unable to gain permanent residency. &ldquo;I applied for permanent status in December 2021 and nine months have passed,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;In March I got a message from the Migration Agency and I contacted them and they just said wait some more, and wait some more.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Hussein is Hazara, an ethnic group persecuted both in his native Afghanistan and in Pakistan, the country he fled to as a child. His family was killed in bomb attacks targeting Hazaras in the Pakistani city of Quetta. Aged just 14, he fled through the Middle East to Europe, eventually gambling on the long trip north to Sweden. &ldquo;I came from hell,&rdquo; he says, pointing to a scar on the back of his head, where shrapnel lodged in the bomb attack.</p> <p class="p3">People like Hussein now face an uncertain future. The new government has made noises about pausing citizenship applications and reviewing the status of those who are legally in the country. The Sweden Democrats have pushed the idea of repatriation hard and want to reduce asylum to the EU&rsquo;s lowest possible baseline, whilst the government as a whole has promised a tougher regime.</p> <p class="p5">To understand how the far right ended up as a powerful force behind Sweden&rsquo;s government, we have to look back at the political crisis leading up to the vote in September. Stefan L&ouml;fven of the centre-left Social Democrats led the country until November 2021, when he resigned and the finance minister Magdalena Andersson replaced him.</p> <p class="p3">During the 2015 refugee crisis, L&ouml;fven had declared that &ldquo;My Sweden does not build walls&rdquo;. But the country soon began to follow other EU states in tightening borders and stepping up deportations in response to growing public opposition to migration. Andersson barely had time to move into her official residence before facing one of the most toxic elections Sweden has ever seen.</p> <p class="p3">The election campaign saw the Social Democrats track further to the right to try and head off attacks from their opponents. Desperation to get into power pushed traditional right-wing parties far beyond what was previously acceptable in Swedish political debate, in a potent combination of culture war rhetoric and welfare nationalism.</p> <h2 class="p3">Channeling Trump in Gotland</h2> <p class="p5">In early July, the European heatwave was still baking Sweden and the island of Gotland in the Baltic sea teemed with people. I was on the island to witness the annual gathering of Sweden&rsquo;s political leaders, followed attentively by lobbyists, diplomats and the press. Everyone was gearing up for the elections.</p> <p class="p3">When Ulf Kristersson, leader of the conservative Moderate party, stepped onto the stage, he had one aim; to paint himself as the tough guy Sweden needed to whip the country back into shape. Just two years earlier, the diminutive politician had staged a carefully choregraphed photo-op with a Holocaust survivor to convince the public of his commitment to human rights and his opposition to far-right politics. In Gotland, however, he cemented his transformation from liberal conservative to populist outrider by explicitly thanking the SD for &ldquo;daring&rdquo; to talk about migration.</p> <p class="p3">Afraid of being labelled a fascist-facilitator, Kristersson referred to Sweden&rsquo;s emerging new right alliance merely as &ldquo;his side&rdquo;. But throughout the election campaign, his message was clear, that getting the old centre-left party out of government and getting tough on crime and migration were more important than splitting hairs over who would be in the new administration.</p> <p class="p3">The problem for the Moderate party was that whatever they could do, the Sweden Democrats could do better. The SD&rsquo;s charismatic and folksy leader Jimmie &Aring;kesson worked the crowd in Gotland flawlessly. &Aring;kesson casts himself as a straight-talking rural boy. He wears his shirt sleeves rolled up and speaks in a well-rehearsed vernacular that cements his image as a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Swede far from the political elite. Surrounded by security, he signed off with the promise that the SD would &ldquo;make Sweden good once again&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">The SD world view is a utopia of white picket fences, low crime and safe small towns where the buildings fly Swedish flags rather than pride flags. The party has tapped into discontent across the political spectrum, building a base featuring everyone from ethnic nationalists to business-minded political climbers. Aided by a formidable network of alternative media and a talent for turning news events into political opportunities, they have cast themselves as the ally of everyone from struggling single mothers to businessmen burdened by high taxes.</p> <p class="p3">Across from where &Aring;kesson spoke, party members sold baseball caps with the letters SD emblazoned on them and T-shirts saying &ldquo;Stop Socialist Feminism&rdquo;. The vitriol directed against Magdalena Andersson, Sweden&rsquo;s first female Prime Minister, recalled the Trumpist obsession with Hilary Clinton. Manning the stall was Rebecka Rapp, resplendent in a white trouser suit and a designer belt, topped off with one of the signature baseball caps. The same age as Hussein and Samir, she told me she joined the SD because they offered a solution to the economic stagnation and crime that the party says is endemic in Swedish cities. She repeated a line that many across the country echoed during the election campaign &ndash; the SD is the only party taking gangs, urban segregation and a spike in gangland shootings seriously. &ldquo;Just this morning there was a stabbing right here in town,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That shows you how dangerous things have become.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">A few hundred metres away, police had indeed locked down the street after a civil servant who was attending the week of political speeches was stabbed to death in plain sight. But this was not evidence of the wave of migrant-related gang crime that the SD warned of: it later came to light that the killer was a member of radical far-right group the Nordic Resistance Movement. The killer&rsquo;s ultimate target was Annie L&ouml;&ouml;f, the leader of Sweden&rsquo;s liberal Centre party, who has become a hate figure on the nationalist right for her commitment to multiculturalism. The killing of a senior government employee and attempted assassination of a political leader should have caused the country to sit up and think, but this was not a normal election campaign.</p> <h2 class="p4">The Gang of Four</h2> <p class="p5">With one week to go before polling day, the city of Eskilstuna, an hour west of Stockholm, resembled many others across Sweden. In the town square, little huts belonging to each political party housed activists handing out leaflets and badges, whilst voters went from group to group listening to what they had to offer. Eskilstuna used to be a stronghold of the Swedish left, but here too the SD has made huge inroads in the last decade. Their stall was a hive of activity. Party Secretary Richard Jomshof was in town. He is one of the powerful group known as the Gang of Four, a close-knit circle of friends that has steered the SD project from bomber jackets and army boots to golf tops and deck shoes.</p> <p class="p3">Jomshof was flanked by security guards as he stepped on stage in front of the town hall. His speech was devoted entirely to why Islamic culture and migration threatens Sweden&rsquo;s very existence.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;I have been re-reading the Qur&rsquo;an,&rdquo; he told the crowd, &ldquo;and for me it is clear that Islam is an inherently violent religion.&rdquo; He rolled through the dog whistles of European cultural nationalism. Muhammad was a warlord who kept sex slaves. Christianity is the basis of European values and the Enlightenment project. Islamic Swedes can never hope to be fully functioning members of society. He finished with a resolute &ldquo;Go home.&rdquo; In the crowd of onlookers there were just a few people not applauding.</p> <p class="p3">Also in the square was a woman in a hijab holding a homemade sign saying &ldquo;No racists in our Streets and Squares&rdquo;. Someone in the crowd turned and asked what she was doing there. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m protesting,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I have read your manifesto and I know what you think about Muslims and migrants.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s name was Babra, a long-term Eskilstuna resident who sees the Sweden Democrats as interlopers in her hometown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here for what seems like a hundred years,&rdquo; she told me, &ldquo;and suddenly I&rsquo;m told that I&rsquo;m not welcome. These people have no place on our streets.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p4">Not just the Sweden Democrats</h2> <p class="p5">The problem for Sweden&rsquo;s migrants is that the SD is now everywhere, in every council and every region in the country. Its emergence over the past 15 years has emboldened critics of migration and multiculturalism in other parties, too. The 2022 election campaign saw politicians across the spectrum float ideas such as ethnic quotas for housing, testing immigrant children for ADHD to reduce crime, and mandatory language tests for children as young as two. Even before they gained power, the SD had helped to push Sweden a long way from the country that opened its doors to the world in 2015.</p> <p class="p3">Election night itself was a tense affair, with just one per cent separating the left and right blocs. Late in the evening the right bloc took the lead and scenes of jubilant SD members were broadcast across the country. Ulf Kristersson claimed victory for his right-wing side but his conservative Moderate party ended up losing votes to the far right. It was clear from the jubilant scenes at the SD party, and the newly emboldened far-right glitterati on TV, who the real winners were.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;I can remember the moment it changed,&rdquo; said Per Kristiansson, a priest with the Church of Sweden. His parish covers the multicultural housing projects of Roseng&aring;rd in the city of Malm&ouml;, one of the areas of deprivation that were front and centre in the election campaign. &ldquo;I was sat in a radio studio with someone from the border police and they said that there weren&rsquo;t any safe havens any more.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Kristiansson was on the frontline when Malm&ouml;, Sweden&rsquo;s third city and the gateway to continental Europe, became the main entry point for those seeking asylum in Sweden during the 2015 crisis. Gradually, the mood changed. People went from welcoming refugees with open arms to blaming them for the city&rsquo;s social problems.</p> <h2 class="p4">A story of social exclusion</h2> <p class="p5">Crime in Sweden&rsquo;s poorer multicultural suburbs was a central focus in the election campaign. This was not entirely baseless: the truth remains that too many young people are being drawn into the criminal underworld. Already, this year holds the record for the highest number of shootings ever officially recorded, almost all located in housing projects in major cities. The new right bloc&rsquo;s proposed solution is tougher policing and sentencing, and suspension of certain civil liberties. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. There is a deeper story of social exclusion here; foreign-born residents are four times as likely to be unemployed as Swedish-born citizens.</p> <p class="p3">Hussein remembers well the experience of pitching up without any knowledge of Swedish society. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of people in Sweden who end up as gangsters because they don&rsquo;t have other options. If you don&rsquo;t get your residency permit and go to school or study then you can&rsquo;t work, not even as a carpenter or a bus or a truck driver. Without a social security number you&rsquo;re nothing,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;The problem is, if you do everything right you still don&rsquo;t always get a good deal. For those of us who worked through high school we can still get rejected. We just want to pay tax, be normal people.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">The new government, which benefited from portraying Sweden as a country in crisis, now has to prove it has the answers to these problems. Kristersson&rsquo;s victory was accompanied by international headlines comparing Sweden to Hungary and Poland. Though he is no doubt keen to avoid such comparisons, one of the government&rsquo;s first steps was to nominate SD politicians to influential parliamentary committees. Emboldened right-wing commentators are already calling for radical reform of public service media. Reducing overseas aid is one of many policies being presented as &ldquo;sensible&rdquo; and &ldquo;fiscally responsible&rdquo; alongside hardline migration and justice reforms.</p> <p class="p3">What is perhaps most alarming is just how easily Swedish conservatives pivoted to working with the far right, finding common ground and united by a shared hatred of the left. By welcoming the SD into power, it is not clear whether Sweden&rsquo;s new Prime Minister is aware of what he has helped to create, or indeed whether he cares.</p> <p class="p6"><em>Some names have been changed</em></p> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

How could complex life have begun to develop without such a code? We may now be opening a new chapter in biology that turns our assumptions upside down.</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1"><strong>The evolution of ideas</strong></p> <p class="p1">The Huxley family was linked with the atheist movement.

And Aldous, we know, actively sought ways to experience this state, through words, through meditation, and finally through his death-bed injection of mescaline, which his wife called &ldquo;a sacrament&rdquo;.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Q&amp;A </strong></p> <p>J.P.

That does indeed begin to look like a eugenics project. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter whether we call it eugenics or not.

It is scarce, inert and yellow. Other metals just can&rsquo;t compete: copper turns green when it oxidises, silver tarnishes as it reacts with sulfurous compounds. Platinum is more promising, but you&rsquo;d need to be a trained metallurgist or jeweller to pick it out from a line-up of other base metals. Only gold survives the ravages of chemistry and history, all the while being easily recognisable. Well, most of the time.<br><br>The Alhambra in Granada is one of the world&rsquo;s most famous and well-preserved examples of Islamic architecture. Its magnificent ceilings were originally gilded with gold, but over the years these deteriorated. In the 19th century, to save on the expense of renovation, the glorious gilding was simply covered with gypsum.<br><br>Then, in 1993, Dr Carolina Cardell from the University of Granada spotted purple patches forming on the ceiling. It is only in recent years, however, that the university acquired the tools and techniques to investigate.<br><br>Dr Cardell and her team knew that whilst pure gold may well be inert, when mixed with other metals to make alloys some chemical reactions can occur. The conditions in the Alhambra made this chemistry possible; the gilding used is actually a leaf of tin coated with a gold/silver alloy. Meanwhile, the salt-rich spray from the nearby sea added chlorides to the mix. These conditions set up electrochemical reactions which dissolved some of the gold within the moist gypsum.<br><br>Using electron microscopic techniques, Dr Cardell spotted signs of this gold embedded within the gypsum. But how does this explain the purple patches? Well, gold nanoparticles are not actually yellow. Instead, they take on a red to purple colour, depending on their size. In fact, you have almost certainly come across this phenomena in recent years. This is because gold nanoparticles are also responsible for the purple smears and lines on the Covid lateral flow tests that we are all too familiar with.<br><br>So, all that is gold does not glitter. Sometimes, it turns purple.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from our New Humanist winter edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>

This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
