<p class="lead">After more than a week of narcotics and steroids, I decided to quit this morning &#8212; the fog and haze and insomnia were too much. It wasn&#8217;t quite cold turkey, because I started dropping the dosage a couple of days ago, but still, this is my first day totally drug-free.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not going real well so far. The pain is back (but still much less than last week), and now I get to deal with diffuse feelings of nausea, and I&#8217;m <em>still</em> foggy and slow. It&#8217;s one of those lose:lose situations and I&#8217;m not having a grand time. I also keep getting reminded that classes start in a few weeks.</p>
<p>I will get better. Next doctor&#8217;s appointment is early Monday morning.</p>

<p class="lead">Clarence Thomas is a shameless crook. Yet again, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-other-billionaires-sokol-huizenga-novelly-supreme-court?taid=64d4b282b029ae0001cef371">ProPublica has done the legwork and exposed the corruption</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>During his three decades on the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas has enjoyed steady access to a lifestyle most Americans can only imagine. A cadre of industry titans and ultrawealthy executives have treated him to far-flung vacations aboard their yachts, ushered him into the premium suites at sporting events and sent their private jets to fetch him — including, on more than one occasion, an entire 737. It’s a stream of luxury that is both more extensive and from a wider circle than has been previously understood.</p>
<p>Like clockwork, Thomas’ leisure activities have been underwritten by benefactors who share the ideology that drives his jurisprudence. Their gifts include:</p>
<p>At least 38 destination vacations, including a previously unreported voyage on a yacht around the Bahamas; 26 private jet flights, plus an additional eight by helicopter; a dozen VIP passes to professional and college sporting events, typically perched in the skybox; two stays at luxury resorts in Florida and Jamaica; and one standing invitation to an uber-exclusive golf club overlooking the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>This accounting of Thomas’ travel, revealed for the first time here from an array of previously unavailable information, is the fullest to date of the generosity that has regularly afforded Thomas a lifestyle far beyond what his income could provide. And it is almost certainly an undercount.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see the words &#8220;luxurious paid vacation&#8221; and I have to scramble to the dictionary to figure out what they mean. Clarence Thomas takes for granted that a billionaire will charter a 737 for him.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how blatant or extravagant it gets, the other members of the Supreme Court will defend the lack of ethical oversight and the Republicans in congress will close their eyes. American &#8220;justice&#8221; is a joke.</p>

<p class="lead">I&#8217;ve been reading Erik Larson&#8217;s <a href="https://amzn.to/3DMqG0u"><i>In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler&#8217;s Berlin</i></a> in the evening, when my mushy brain allows me to focus for a bit. It&#8217;s good, but weirdly on-the-nose for someone living in America in the 2020s.</p>
<p>A quick summary: William Dodd, an ordinary history professor, gets selected to serve as the American ambassador to Germany in 1933, largely because the usual gang of civil servants all said &#8220;Holy shit, no, Hitler is coming to power and that dude is nuts.&#8221; He agrees to it because he thinks he&#8217;ll be freed up from his many university duties to write his magnum opus, a multi-volume history of the Old South, which, spoiler alert, he&#8217;s never going to finish. I sympathize a bit &#8212; escaping committee work and teaching for a few years, to host an occasional social whirl among the wealthy people of Europe? Sounds tempting. Except for the &#8220;Oh, right, Hitler&#8221; part.</p>
<p>So he gets there and steps right into the back-biting internal politics of the diplomatic corps. He&#8217;s a middle-class, fairly conservative but politically liberal fellow, plunged into a social scene ruled on the American side by an axis of privileged, filthy rich Harvard/Princeton/Yale alumni who love indolence and the perks of their offices; they&#8217;re all maneuvering behind his back to undercut his austerity initiatives, and seem to spend more time defending their right to send lengthy telegrams across the Atlantic while partying to all hours and getting up at 10am than in dealing with the crisis at hand. Dodd is being undermined, while at the same time he&#8217;s acquiring a reputation as the Cassandra of American diplomacy, because he&#8217;s horrified by the Nazis.</p>
<p>Many of his peers are busy with propping up policies of appeasement &#8212; they don&#8217;t want their gravy train tipped over. They know Hitler is a jumped-up nobody, and they keep predicting that the sensible German people and their well-established representatives will eventually set the lunatic aside, nobody could possibly let him run roughshod over such a civilized nation.  He&#8217;s a flash in the pan. Cooler heads will prevail.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for those who know a little history, in 1934 the Night of Long Knives happens. Dodd, as a diplomat, knew everyone involved &#8212; Röhm, the leader of the brown shirts, lived just around the corner from the embassy. Himmler and Göring were familiar social acquaintances; his daughter, Martha Dodd, was sleeping with Rudolf Diels, commander of the Gestapo (she seems to have jumped into bed with any prominent Nazi she could find, and also with Russian NKVD agents &#8212; she was a liberal modern woman. She initially admires the Nazis, eventually becoming disillusioned and transferring her adoration to Russian communists. She was also a naive woman.) It&#8217;s stunning how much horrible history was happening right there in this corner of Berlin, in these few years of history.</p>
<p>From there, it descends into a seemingly inevitable spiral of chaos, and we know how that ended up. Dodd is eventually squeezed out and returns home to wander the lecture circuit, telling everyone how evil the Nazi regime was.</p>
<p>What most struck me, though, was the ubiquitous anti-Semitism. The Americans opposed Nazi policies of imprisoning and murdering Jews, for sure…but behind the scenes all the American civil servants are nodding and agreeing that yes, there is a &#8220;Jewish problem&#8221; and gosh, Jews sure have crept deviously into positions of influence, like Jews always do. These were the people of power and influence, all assuming that yes, Jews are undesirable, but it just won&#8217;t do to <em>kill</em> them outright like the Nazis were doing. Even Dodd was making these kinds of arguments, accepting the Nazi premise but only rejecting their methods.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dodd_(ambassador)">Dodd&#8217;s wikipedia page</a> makes this same observation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Edward M. House, a veteran in Democratic Party circles since the Wilson administration, told Dodd that he should do what he could &#8220;to ameliorate Jewish sufferings,&#8221; but cautioned, &#8220;the Jews should not be allowed to dominate economic or intellectual life in Berlin as they have done for a long time.&#8221; Dodd shared House&#8217;s views and wrote in his diary that &#8220;The Jews had held a great many more of the key positions in Germany than their numbers or talents entitled them to.&#8221; Based on this view of the proper role of Jews in society, he advised Hitler in March 1934 that Jewish influence should be restrained in Germany as it was in the United States. &#8220;I explained to him [Hitler],&#8221; wrote Dodd, &#8220;that where a question of over-activity of Jews in university or official life made trouble, we had managed to redistribute the offices in such a way as to not give great offense.&#8221; Hitler ignored Dodd&#8217;s advice and responded that &#8220;if they [the Jews] continue their activity we shall make a complete end of them in this country.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This kind of mealy-mouthed defense is ubiquitous in the book. There are no heroes, only a few people who had glimmerings of the consequences of the bigotry that they also shared.</p>
<p>The author makes the point that maybe the Nazi catastrophe wasn&#8217;t inevitable at all, that what it required were people of integrity to point out that it was all built on lies and hatred, but when the people you depend on to stand for what is right are all Ivy League dickheads who don&#8217;t even recognize the humanity of the Jewish people, all responses will be ineffectual and actually enabling. I felt like the diplomatic corps prior to WWII was made of an army of Tucker Carlsons. No wonder Hitler got away with so much criminality early in his career!</p>
<p>The book did not fill me with confidence about the future. I see the same phenomenon going on around me right now: we have media that are constantly making the case that Jews, or Palestinians, or black people, or trans people, or &lt;name your hated minority here&gt; are less than fully human, that we can abridge their rights because they are lesser beings, and we are becoming inured to this kind of language. Nick Fuentes is not some amusing comedian, the Proud Boys are not a fraternal organization, Fox News is not just echoing the perspective of a simple demographic. These are all kinds of monstrous haters who are building a foundation for an unimaginably evil future.</p>
<p>You can try to pretend it can&#8217;t happen here…but it&#8217;s happening here.</p>

<p class="lead">An 8-year old boy in Bolivia picked up a black widow spider and urged it to bite him (this isn&#8217;t as easy as you think, black widows are shy and reluctant to bite) because <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/boy-8-let-black-widow-bite-because-wanted-become-spiderman-1816883">he wanted to become Spider-Man</a>. This is a worthy goal, but his methods weren&#8217;t particularly effective. A doctor explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These black spiders with red backs are black widows. They do not cause anyone to become Spider-Man—on the contrary, they are putting lives at risk,&#8221; Vásquez said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The kid is fine, but this has happened before!</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2020, a similar case occurred in the rural Bolivian town of Chayanta, in the Andean region of Potosí, involving three children aged 8, 10 and 12 respectively. The trio provoked a black widow spider to bite them with the same objective. Doctors also managed to successfully treat the children in that incident as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, further public education is necessary. The children of South America must have it explained to them that the procedure requires a <em>radioactive</em> spider.</p>
<p>Hey, any millionaires/billionaires out there want to <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/08/09/asked-and-answered/">shovel money at me</a> to feed spiders radioactive food and allow them to bite me?</p>

This means that adults are considered to have given their consent to be a potential organ donor after their death unless they specifically say they don&rsquo;t want to be.</p> <p>The change will likely save many lives. Ten to 15 patients die each year in Northern Ireland while awaiting a transplant. Currently, there are around 150 people on the waiting list. The new law is named after six-year-old D&aacute;ith&iacute; Mac Gabhann, who has been waiting for a heart transplant for five years. His family fought for the change in law, alongside campaigners who pointed out that 90 per cent of people in Northern Ireland supported organ donation but only half were signed up to the Organ Donor Register.</p> <p>The trend towards opt-out across the UK mirrors the rest of Europe. Most of the continent has now shifted to an opt-out system. However, when it comes to advancing organ donations, the evidence shows that opt-out legislation is often insufficient on its own.</p> <p>Public education is key. Under soft opt-out systems, like those in the UK, family members can intervene to block a donation after a relative&rsquo;s death &ndash; this often happens because families aren&rsquo;t sure what their relative wanted, so it&rsquo;s important that people talk about their beliefs and intentions. But above all, systems to identify opportunities for donations and good matches with patients need to be improved. That could take many forms, including new technologies. The National Institute for Health and Care Research and the NHS are helping to fund the development of a system using artificial intelligence. Researchers believe that AI could prove more effective than surgeons at examining donor organs and assessing their suitability for transplant.</p> <p>The team estimates that the new system could result in up to 200 more patients receiving kidney transplants and 100 more receiving liver transplants every year in the UK.</p> <p>The move towards opt-out organ donation is a positive sign of societal progress. Increasing the availability of organs for donation will only become more important as our populations age, meaning that a lower percentage of organs will be suitable for transplant. Demand always outstrips supply, and we must carry on doing what we can, whether through changing legislation, public awareness or technological progress.</p> <p>Organ donation saves lives, and anything that helps one more organ reach a patient in need is a change worth fighting for.</p> <p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW44446969 BCX0"><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/red-dot-Q98X_JVRGS0-unsplash-_1_.jpg" height="1440" alt="Polling station" width="1920"></p> <p>The local election in May was the first UK election to implement new regulations that require voters to show a photo ID. Fears that this requirement would prevent some people from voting &ndash; weakening British democracy and risking the disenfranchisement of marginalised groups &ndash; were confirmed.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission&rsquo;s full report is expected in September, but its interim report published in June revealed that nearly 14,000 people were denied a vote (the Commission noted that these figures are likely an underestimation). Roughly 0.7 per cent of people were initially turned away from stations for not having an admissible form of identification, such as a passport, driving licence or voter certificate. Most of those people returned later with the correct ID and were able to vote but there were still at least 0.25 per cent who tried to and could not.</p> <p>What is harder to measure is how many people simply stayed at home on the day because they did not possess the right form of ID, and how many turned back before they reached the ballot-issuing desk &ndash; some polling stations warned people at the entrance about the requirement and the number of voters leaving at this point was not recorded. As a result, we will likely never know the full impact.</p> <p>Due to electoral rules, it was not possible to collect comprehensive demographic data. But a small survey carried out by the Electoral Commission suggested that &ldquo;some people found it harder than others to show accepted voter ID, including disabled people and the unemployed.&rdquo; This appears to confirm concerns that the new regulations would have the gravest effect on people already marginalised and therefore less likely to have the correct ID, including ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Photo ID has already been required in Northern Ireland for two decades. Toby James, a professor of politics and public policy at the University of East Anglia, told MPs that about 2.3 per cent of the electorate failed to vote in the first Northern Ireland assembly election following the introduction of the requirements as a direct consequence, and that it would be reasonable to expect a similar figure across the UK. If accurate, that will mean the voices of 1.1 million people who want to have a say on our next government will go unheard because of the rule.</p> <p>The justification for voter ID requirements is that they will prevent people voting in somebody else&rsquo;s name at polling stations &ndash; an offence known as &ldquo;personation&rdquo;. Yet this justification does not stand up to scrutiny. In 2019 there were just two allegations of personation at polling stations that resulted in cautions or convictions, out of 58 million votes cast in the UK that year.</p> <p>That gives rise to the question of the true motivation. Given the groups most affected, critics see a cynical attempt by the Conservative government to disenfranchise voters who might be less inclined to support them. In an extraordinary statement at the National Conservatism conference in May, former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg appeared to admit as much &ndash; though he noted that the ploy may have backfired.</p> <p>&ldquo;Parties that try and gerrymander end up finding their clever scheme comes back to bite them, as, dare I say, we found by insisting on voter ID for elections,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We found the people who didn&rsquo;t have ID were elderly and they, by and large, voted Conservative, so we made it hard for our own voters and we upset a system that worked perfectly well.&rdquo;</p> <p>Elections need to be secure, but they also need to be as accessible as possible. At best, the voter ID requirement weakens our democracy without adequate justification. At worst, it is a profoundly undemocratic attempt at voter suppression. Whichever it is, the outcome is the same: Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of disenfranchisement at the next general election.</p> <p><em><a href="/subscribe">This article is a preview from New Humanist's autumn 2023 issue.

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/newhumanistlaurietoast.jpg" height="687" alt="A cartoon shows Laurie Taylor popping, slightly charred, out of a toaster" width="500"></p> <p>I dislike anniversaries. With the help of my Filofax I can usually manage to honour the bulk of my friends&rsquo; birthdays &ndash; &ldquo;Hi Charlotte. Best wishes for your very special day. Gosh doesn&rsquo;t time fly. Do give me a ring next time you&rsquo;re down south&rdquo; &ndash; but I am frankly unable to pronounce with any degree of certainty upon the length of my present marriage, the exact number of years since my pacemaker was fitted or the precise date when my beloved Liverpool were last declared champions of Europe.</p> <p>However, the week before last, when I trooped into Broadcasting House to make another edition of my BBC Radio 4 programme Thinking Allowed, I was energetically confronted by my normally cool producer. Did I know the significance of the episode we were about to make? Not really. Did the year 1998 mean anything to me? Not really. Sorry. Sorry.</p> <p>My producer gave me a slightly sorrowful smile. &ldquo;Laurie, this is our anniversary. Our programme has now been broadcast on Radio 4 for exactly 25 years. So many great memories! Remember the social mobility programme?&rdquo;</p> <p>How could I forget? I knew immediately she was talking about the day, 20 years ago, when I was interviewing an expert on social mobility and noticed with alarm that he was sliding from his studio chair. In the hope that he might quickly right himself, I pursued my questioning. &ldquo;Your research indicates an overall decline in social mobility&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;How might you account for that?&rdquo;</p> <p>I never got my answer because, with a little whimper, my guest slipped further sideways and then, with a little jerk, fell to the studio floor where he lay motionless amid a tangled mass of studio cables. A frantic producer hissed into my earphones. &ldquo;Laurie. Laurie. Go to your emails.&rdquo; Thankfully the guest was fine and in the pub afterwards we laughed ourselves silly over the incident.</p> <p>But that happy memory epitomises my problem with all such anniversaries: they rarely have a singular dimension. So while it was certainly great fun to remember the day of the disappearing studio guest, I couldn&rsquo;t relish the incident without also remembering that it occurred at the very time that I was desperately trying to end my unhappy relationship with Sandra, suffering from a rather nasty pubic rash, and had just been told by my dentist that the inside of my mouth resembled a blitzed housing estate.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s a paradox perfectly captured by Philip Larkin in his poem &ldquo;Reference Back&rdquo;:</p> <p>&ldquo;Truly, though our element is time,<br>We&rsquo;re not suited to the long perspectives<br>Open at each instant of our lives.<br>They link us to our losses...&rdquo;</p> <p>There is perhaps one surprising and positive aspect to anniversaries. They can remind us of the road not taken. Nobody captured that benefit with more fervour than my old friend Angela, who, in a tipsy conversation during her 38th wedding anniversary party, confided this insight.</p> <p>&ldquo;Laurie&rdquo;, she said, glancing across the room to her husband. &ldquo;You know what this anniversary has made me realise? If I had killed Maurice the first time I thought about it, I&rsquo;d have been out of jail by now.&rdquo;</p> <p>No such muddled memories ever interfered with my mother&rsquo;s wholesale embrace of anniversaries. During my childhood, I was frequently reminded that I had been named due to the proximity of my birthday to the date of the martyrdom of Saint Laurence.</p> <p>In one respect, Saint Laurence deserved to be honoured. He famously gave all his money away to charity. However, as I later learned, in honouring his anniversary I would also be honouring the date in AD 258 when he was martyred on a red-hot gridiron. As the coals burned into his skin, he had the temerity to give a word of advice to his torturers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m well done on this side. Turn me over&rdquo;.</p> <p>For all my horror of anniversaries, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking that this ancient utterance by my namesake might make a rather fine last set of words &ndash; for myself.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Dolls from Barbie's 'Inspiring Women' range. Credit: Mattel" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/barbie-cropped.jpg" height="479" alt="Rosa Parks, Frida Kahlo and Sally Ride in Barbie form, from Mattel's 'Inspiring Women Series'" width="747"></p> <p>You never really notice how many Japanese tourists there are in central London, do you? They aren&rsquo;t brutish like the Americans, and rarely go around complaining about everything like the French. They just blend into the background, quietly taking photos. But walking from Westminster to Soho in mid-July, on my way to a screening of Greta Gerwig&rsquo;s <em>Barbie</em>, they were suddenly unavoidable. The problem was that I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about the letters splashed across my chest, written in bright pink, swirly script. &ldquo;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds&rdquo;, the T-shirt screamed.</p> <p>Like a dress that is too tight or heels too high, the shirt seemed like a good idea until I left the house. It was, you see, a &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo; shirt, made to celebrate the fact that <em>Barbie</em> was coming out on the same day as Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s <em>Oppenheimer</em>, a thriller about the man who led the development of the atomic bomb. The clash of the two movies, with their incongruous combination of themes, was always bound to become a meme. Plans were hatched around the world to go see them one after the other and debates were had on which to see first &ndash; including what anyone could possibly wear to fit with both themes.</p> <p>All this made me laugh a lot, which is why I headed to the <em>Barbie</em> press screening wearing what I did. I thought Greta Gerwig would approve; before she became the pet director of a multinational toy company, she worked on a series of witty indie movies. Every bit of marketing behind <em>Barbie</em> made it seem like she was winking at us from behind a bubble gum curtain, hinting that she hadn&rsquo;t lost her edge. The whole thing would be odd and meta and knowingly farcical. Of course she&rsquo;d love &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo;. But walking to the cinema I suddenly became incredibly aware of the fact that I was wearing a T-shirt openly joking about the invention of a bomb that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians.</p> <p>Once in the Cineworld I experienced a different kind of unease. As journalists, we were told to sign an embargo and made to &ldquo;pinky promise&rdquo; not to leak anything by an upbeat woman holding her little finger in the air. Still, we were allowed &ndash; nay, encouraged! &ndash; to post any positive reactions we might have on social media. Large, pink bags of complimentary popcorn were sitting on our laps. What had we got ourselves into?</p> <p>The lights went out, two hours passed, and by the end I still wasn&rsquo;t sure. For the avoidance of doubt, <em>Barbie</em> is a fun movie. It is, at times, laugh-out-loud funny, Ryan Gosling&rsquo;s Ken is hysterically compelling, and the many cameos never fail to delight.</p> <p>The premise, if you must know, goes like this. Following a perfect day in Barbie Land, where Barbies are doctors and judges and journalists and Nobel Prize winners and presidents, and Kens are just Kens, one Barbie sinks into an existential funk. She sleeps poorly and cannot stop thinking about dying. The soles of her feet, once beautifully arched, are now stubbornly flat. There is cellulite on her thighs.</p> <p>Following a visit to Weird Barbie, a wise old doll who was played with so much that her hips cannot help but fall into the splits, it is concluded that a tear has opened up in the fabric of reality, caused by the connection between our Barbie and the girl playing with her being too strong. In order to stop both worlds coming to ruin, the doll must go to the real world and find out what is going on.</p> <p>What follows is&hellip;well, it&rsquo;s a lot. At first, Mattel executives appear to be the main antagonists, wishing to put the human-sized doll back in her box. You may be shocked to hear that this doesn&rsquo;t last &ndash; Mattel, after all, ordered and paid for the movie. Instead, the real twist comes when Ken, who followed Barbie on her jaunt, discovers the patriarchy.</p> <p>Men run things in the real world! They have cars and horses! It isn&rsquo;t like Barbie Land, where all they do is sit on the beach and yearn. He returns home before Barbie does and turns it into Kenland. By the time Protagonist Barbie comes back, all hell has got loose. What oh what can she and her human sidekicks do to restore the balance of the universe? You may be able to guess. It&rsquo;s feminism. What else could it possibly be?</p> <p>In fairness to Gerwig, she doesn&rsquo;t go for the lowest hanging fruit of female empowerment. Barbies aren&rsquo;t freed by being told that they can achieve anything a man can, if only they set their mind to it. Instead, their emancipation comes from a surprisingly irate speech from America Ferrera, playing the real-life mother of a teenage girl.</p> <p>It is impossible to be a woman, she says: the female experience in a patriarchal society is so full of contradictions that no woman can go through it without going mad. We must be assertive without being bossy; we must have money but never ask for it; we must look good but not so good that we draw too much attention to ourselves; we must run things without telling anyone what to do, and so on. In Kenland, as in any other society ruled by men, women can never win. Faced with this maddening realisation, the Barbies short-circuit and return to their old selves.</p> <p>Stripped of their power, the Kens begin lashing out then eventually demure. Running stuff is hard, it turns out! That&rsquo;s what Gosling&rsquo;s Ken tearfully tells Barbie. Because she is not in love with him, she tells him to find out who he is if he is not defined by his relationship with her. In the end, it feels worth noting that few people &ndash; or dolls &ndash; are truly happy, eschewing what would or should have been the conclusion of a more traditional storyline.</p> <p>In short: the <em>Barbie</em> movie really isn&rsquo;t as bad as it could have been, and I should know. I spent two hours chewing on my sweet, low-cal popcorn and scrutinising it. I took notes on the risqu&eacute; jokes and pondered its politics on my walk home.</p> <p>But then I caught myself wondering what wave of feminism <em>Barbie</em> felt closest to and it stopped me in my tracks. I&rsquo;d gone to see a movie about a plastic doll, made by the very people who manufacture that plastic doll. What on earth was I on about?</p> <p>I wondered if that is what the studio had wanted &ndash; if they&rsquo;d been trying to have their cake and eat it. The <em>Barbie</em> movie is pink and saccharine and, yes, enjoyable enough that anyone, teenage or not, can turn it into a fun day out. Its producer and occasional madcap promotional work were intriguing enough that pretentious essayists like me can try to tear it apart and see if there really is anything going on underneath.</p> <p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean we should, though. What if the <em>Barbie</em> movie was just that, a bit of harmless entertainment? Must everything have depth? Equally, must all mainstream pop culture be treated as deserving of pointed criticism?</p> <p>Mass internet culture has flattened everything and now all movies are treated the same &ndash; whether they are fantasy comedies, or heavyweights about the darkest parts of our history. I assumed I wanted to write an in-depth critique of <em>Barbie</em> because that is what people like me &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to do these days. I wore a T-shirt about a movie in which a man invents a bomb that can kill millions because I thought it was hilarious that it had become tied with a silly movie about girly girls. The meme had become so powerful that there was no meaning left.</p> <p>It isn&rsquo;t good for us, but it is good for business. People who probably do not care about military history got memed into going to watch a movie about it, and so did people who have no particular interest in children&rsquo;s toys. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it&rsquo;s mostly made me want to have an existential crisis, which is ironic because that is what makes Barbie leave Barbie Land and join the real world. Perhaps she was the lucky one. What do you do if nothing feels real in your world, but there is nowhere else you can escape to?</p> <p><em>This is a preview from the autumn 2023 issue of New Humanist. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe now</a> to get it delivered to your door in August.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks to Podimo and TellTale studios for supporting and producing the podcast.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->
