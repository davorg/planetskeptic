<p>ACTIVE resistance against the criminal establishments around the world will greatly increase the sooner someone TRULY understands that the ruling cabal and their minions (in governments, big corporations, big banks, big media, big science, big religions, etc), anywhere around the globe, are PSYCHOPATHS — the evidence is OVERWHELMINGLY ROBUST.</p></blockquote>

<p class="lead">The end is nigh. The university administration has requested that we submit our fall term syllabi on the 24th of July…that is, <em>tomorrow</em>. I am not prepared. I don&#8217;t want to think about this. I haven&#8217;t been thinking about this.</p>
<p>So that takes care of today, I guess. I&#8217;ve pulled up the academic calendar for the fall, and my previous version of the syllabus, and am going to sit down and reconcile lecture &amp; exam dates and will get the damn things done today.</p>
<p>In other academic concerns, I&#8217;ve been invited to give an honors college lecture on the theme of…Michel de Montaigne, like I&#8217;d be qualified to discuss late Renaissance history. It&#8217;s OK, though, I&#8217;ve read his <i>Essays</i>, and since he was an exceptionally discursive writer, I figure I can get away with my own ramblings in the style of an old humanist. I did find a quote that might make for a good springboard:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our utmost endeavors cannot arrive at so much as to imitate the nest of the least of birds, its contexture, beauty, and convenience: not so much as the web of a poor spider.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to correct that back-handed compliment, but I also have a bunch of other ideas, not all spider-related, that I&#8217;ll assemble into a hodge-podge of a talk. The title: &#8220;Of boundaries and transgressions.&#8221; Should be fun. I have until October to pull it together, but I think I&#8217;d better have most of it in shape before September body-slams me.</p>

<p class="lead">Mary and I saw <i>Barbie</i> last night. Ben Shapiro is partly right &#8212; it is the most woke movie I&#8217;ve ever seen. Although…we watched the whole thing, eagerly awaiting the gay orgy scene and the raging trans character stealing all the scenes, and were so disappointed. The closest we got to an orgy was two Kens kissing Ken on the cheek, and I guess we have to trust that there was a trans person there, but she was just playing Barbie like all the other Barbies. </p>
<p>It was loaded full of the Feminizms, though. And the Kens were patriarchal assholes, kinda incel-like, but the movie was also sympathetic to them and tried provide solutions to their problems. There was all this talk of autonomy and independence and freedom and positivity and  kindness, though, and I can see why Shapiro would think it was garbage &#8212; he doesn&#8217;t like any of that stuff. There&#8217;s even a Shapiro joke, with one Barbie saying that she&#8217;s comfortable with both logic and emotion at the same time.</p>
<p>There were also some good jokes about the Snyderverse, and the last line of the movie is a killer. I felt sorry for Alan, Ken&#8217;s Buddy, and poor permanently pregnant Midge.</p>
<p>Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie were perfectly cast. (You should google their names right now: Google will give you a pink fireworks show.) Both were energetic and entertaining.</p>
<p>Recommended.</p>
<p>I know everyone is talking about the contrast between <i>Barbie</i> and <i>Oppenheimer</i>, but unfortunately the latter movie isn&#8217;t scheduled for a showing at my local theater. Once they get done showing that lying waste of time, <i>Sound of Freedom</i>, next week, maybe I&#8217;ll get to see it.</p>
<p>Oh, and here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23799502/barbie-movie-review-margot-robbie-ryan-gosling">more thorough review</a>, if you want that.</p>

<p class="lead">Elisabeth Bik is getting mad. She has spent the better part of a decade <a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/22/10/30/2348221/science-has-a-nasty-photoshopping-problem">finding examples of scientific fraud</a>, and it seems to be easy pickings.</p>
<blockquote><p>Although this was eight years ago, I distinctly recall how angry it made me. This was cheating, pure and simple. By editing an image to produce a desired result, a scientist can manufacture proof for a favored hypothesis, or create a signal out of noise. Scientists must rely on and build on one another&#8217;s work. Cheating is a transgression against everything that science should be. If scientific papers contain errors or — much worse — fraudulent data and fabricated imagery, other researchers are likely to waste time and grant money chasing theories based on made-up results&#8230;..</p>
<p>But were those duplicated images just an isolated case? With little clue about how big this would get, I began searching for suspicious figures in biomedical journals&#8230;. By day I went to my job in a lab at Stanford University, but I was soon spending every evening and most weekends looking for suspicious images. In 2016, I published an analysis of 20,621 peer-reviewed papers, discovering problematic images in no fewer than one in 25. Half of these appeared to have been manipulated deliberately — rotated, flipped, stretched or otherwise photoshopped. With a sense of unease about how much bad science might be in journals, I quit my full-time job in 2019 so that I could devote myself to finding and reporting more cases of scientific fraud.</p>
<p>Using my pattern-matching eyes and lots of caffeine, I have analyzed more than 100,000 papers since 2014 and found apparent image duplication in 4,800 and similar evidence of error, cheating or other ethical problems in an additional 1,700. I&#8217;ve reported 2,500 of these to their journals&#8217; editors and — after learning the hard way that journals often do not respond to these cases — posted many of those papers along with 3,500 more to PubPeer, a website where scientific literature is discussed in public&#8230;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many scientific journals and academic institutions are slow to respond to evidence of image manipulation — if they take action at all. So far, my work has resulted in 956 corrections and 923 retractions, but a majority of the papers I have reported to the journals remain unaddressed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen some of the fraud reports, and it amazes me how stupid the scientists committing these fakes must be. It&#8217;s as if they think jpeg artifacts don&#8217;t exist, and can be an obvious fingerprint when chunks of an image are duplicated; they don&#8217;t realize that you can reveal cheating by just tweaking a LUT and seeing all the duplicated edges light up. The only reason it&#8217;s done is to adjust your data to make it look like you <em>expected</em> it to look, which is an obvious act against the most basic scientific principles: you&#8217;re supposed to use science to avoid fooling yourself, not to make it easy to fool others.</p>
<p>This behavior ought to be harshly punished. If image fakery became in issue when one of my peers came up for tenure or promotion, I&#8217;d reject them without hesitation. It&#8217;s not even a question: this behavior is a deep violation of scientific and ethical principles, and would make all of their work untrustworthy.</p>
<p>Also, this is a problem with the for-profit journal publication system. Those scientists paid money for those pages, how can we possibly enforce honesty? The bad actors wouldn&#8217;t pay us for journal articles anymore!</p>
<p>But guess what happens when Elisabeth Bik takes a principled stand?</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of my fellow detectives remain anonymous, operating under pseudonyms such as Smut Clyde or Cheshire. Criticizing other scientists&#8217; work is often not well received, and concerns about negative career consequences can prevent scientists from speaking out. Image problems I have reported under my full name have resulted in hateful messages, angry videos on social media sites and two lawsuit threats&#8230;.</p>
<p>Things could be about to get even worse. Artificial intelligence might help detect duplicated data in research, but it can also be used to generate fake data. It is easy nowadays to produce fabricated photos or videos of events that never happened, and A.I.-generated images might have already started to poison the scientific literature. As A.I. technology develops, it will become significantly harder to distinguish fake from real.</p>
<p>Science needs to get serious about research fraud.
</p></blockquote>
<p>How about instantly firing people who do this? Our tenure contracts generally have a moral turpitude clause, you know. This counts.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Shy-527x815.jpg" height="490" alt="The cover art from 'Shy' shows the silhouette of a boy" width="527"></strong></p> <p><strong>Shy (Faber &amp; Faber)</strong> by Max Porter</p> <p>Creeping down a corridor at night, spliff safely stowed, Walkman in hand, avoiding the squeaky floorboards, a deeply troubled 16-year-old boy is running away. There is a lot to run away from. The title character of the novel <em>Shy</em> is making a chaotic escape from Last Chance &ndash; a countryside boarding house for &ldquo;very disturbed young men&rdquo;. As he wanders into the mid-1990s night air, a tangle of voices, memories and emotions tear through him.</p> <p>In the course of the novel, we see Shy&rsquo;s ability to unleash violence, his sexual misadventures, the knife-edge teeter into manic episodes, the precise pressure-cooker blend of frustration and turmoil known only to his see-sawing mind &ndash; they are all visited upon him as he stumbles and remembers and ponders. This short book can be read as the third of a trilogy by Max Porter that explores childhood and the yawning chasms of potential horror that love and parenthood can expose us to when catastrophe occurs.</p> <p>His first novel, <em>Grief Is the Thing With Feathers</em>, relates the harrowing death of a young mother and the impact on her partner and two sons. The second, <em>Lanny</em>, explores the impact on parents, friends and the wider community when a young child goes missing. In <em>Shy</em>, the all-consuming nightmare of a young person morphing from an apparently happy child into an unpredictable and troubled teenager deftly brings home not just the desperate rollercoaster that the individual may be on, but also the enormity of what families in this not-uncommon scenario can be grappling with.</p> <p>In one heartbreaking flashback to the not-too-distant past, Shy recalls his mother and stepfather bribing him with a packet of cigarettes to join them watching the camcorder videos they made of his childhood &ndash; a happy boy playing and singing in the summer sunshine. Of course, the tactic cannot bring back what has been swept away. Back in the present we learn that Last Chance is to be closed and turned into luxury flats.</p> <p>Is Shy escaping the confines of the grounds, or is he dumping his home before it dumps him? The brute heartlessness of capitalism and governments&rsquo; obeisance to the market loom from every shadow in this book. But despite the dark subject matter, there is endless playfulness and bursts of joy &ndash; both an insight into Shy&rsquo;s frothing, giddy mind and of course, Porter&rsquo;s own form-busting creative flair.</p> <p>A book concerning the teenage nihilism of a white male protagonist brought up in a loving family could easily be dismissed as an exploration of &ldquo;first world problems&rdquo;, but Shy&rsquo;s extreme behaviour and profound mental health issues put him beyond this unhelpful label and invite a mature discussion about the chronic malaise masculinity finds itself in today. Shy and his contemporaries at Last Chance may be steeped in Lynx Africa and spend their days trading puerile sexual insults &ndash; but they are also a perfect reminder of how fundamentally compromised as individuals, and as a society, we have been by generations of male omerta around basic emotional articulation, let alone mental health issues.</p> <p>Porter&rsquo;s discipline-blurring mixture of broken and mashed-up prose, poetry and page layout experimentation was used to good effect in his previous books &ndash; particularly in his dramatic fictional account of the last moments of the artist Francis Bacon&rsquo;s life. It seems even more suited to describing the bipolar oscillations, drug-induced pace changes and snapping viewpoints of a teenage mind on the cusp of violence or psychosis. The narrative builds in intensity like a panic attack &ndash; new dimensions of unexpected awfulness sloshing into an already overflowing vessel.</p> <p>Porter gives articulation to the inarticulate, wires us into the fluctuating private meditations of a young man in the grip of a mental health crisis in prose which flowers into a stunning display of empathic prowess. Shy shows us how the ripples of sickness on the surface of civilisation not only spread out in damaging concentric circles, but can also reveal the wild undercurrents beneath &ndash; those ancient churning forces still warping the world we live in.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Some allies of the former Prime Minister have dubbed the process a &ldquo;kangaroo court&rdquo;, a description that suggests that the committee in charge might be improvised, illegitimate or corrupt. The committee members are not amused.</p> <p>The earliest written sources of the phrase &ldquo;kangaroo court&rdquo; are American &ndash; not Australian, as you might expect. A 1841 article in the <em>Daily Picayune</em> from New Orleans quoted another journal reporting lynchings &ldquo;on charges of the Kangaroo Court&rdquo;. This may, however, be a result of the presence of Australian miners in America. Why Kangaroo Courts? Perhaps because they were the ones that dealt with &ldquo;claim-jumping&rdquo; (when someone tries to take over someone else&rsquo;s mining area). Others looking for the metaphor in the phrase have suggested that the court itself was &ldquo;jumped up&rdquo;, or that the improvised system of justice proceeded by leaps and bounds. Or even that the process was in the &ldquo;pouch&rdquo; of the accuser. The origins of oral phrases are frequently elusive.</p> <p>And what of the word &ldquo;kangaroo&rdquo; itself? The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> cites Captain Cook&rsquo;s journal from 1770: &ldquo;The animals which I have before mentioned, called by the Natives Kangooroo or Kanguru.&rdquo; The &ldquo;natives&rdquo; he refers to here were the Aboriginal people at what colonialists called Endeavour River, Queensland. This claim was then rubbished, replaced by a widely held belief that the word means &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&rdquo;, given as an answer to Cook and his crew&rsquo;s attempts to speak English to the Indigenous people. Linguistic fieldwork, however, has since confirmed the existence of a word &ldquo;gangurru&rdquo; in the northeast Aboriginal language of Guugu Yimidhirr, referring to a species of kangaroo. So it may be that Cook was not so wrong after all.</p> <p>Rather as with Mr Johnson&rsquo;s notion of truth, the origins of both &ldquo;kangaroo court&rdquo; and &ldquo;kangaroo&rdquo; are not so easy to pin down.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistPhones-lowres.jpg" height="1928" alt="An illustration shows a smart phone next to a dumb phone with conversation spilling out of them" width="1500"></p> <p>My friend Vera likes to send me voice notes. Each one arrives with the innocent ping of an ordinary WhatsApp message. A Trojan Horse, ready to unload its hidden cargo the moment I open it. When I do so, Vera&rsquo;s thoughts tumble out of my phone in a cascade of half-sentences and tangents, an improvised monologue composed entirely for me, wrapped in the background hum of the busy street she is currently walking along. I love these messages and I hate them in roughly equal measure.</p> <p>Last year, WhatsApp announced that users of the messaging app send an average of 7 billion voice notes every single day. The internet is awash with articles proclaiming that the era of the voice note has arrived. &ldquo;How voice memos became the new texts,&rdquo; explained Australia&rsquo;s ABC news in March last year, &ldquo;Third of Gen Z now prefer VOICE NOTES to texts,&rdquo; bellowed MailOnline in October, &ldquo;The hot new thing in tech: speaking into your phone,&rdquo; snarked CNN in February 2021.</p> <p>And yet, for every article proclaiming the brilliance of this new medium, there is another explaining why it should be made immediately extinct. Recent polling by YouGov reflects this unease. Of nearly 2,000 smartphone users, they found that only 16 per cent liked sending voice notes, whilst 36 per cent disliked it. Even among Gen Z, the supposed epicentre of the current voice message boom, half of those polled still said they dislike sending them, compared to 30 per cent who do.</p> <p>How to make sense of our ambivalent feelings towards this nascent phenomenon? For all its much heralded newness, the voice note essentially combines the functionality of two relatively old pieces of telephone technology: the text message (invented in 1992) and the answerphone (invented in 1949). A voice note is a recorded message, like the kind we used to leave on each other&rsquo;s answerphones but now rarely do. Whereas those earlier messages were usually intended as a prelude to a phone conversation, a voice note is the conversation &ndash; like a series of text messages, but burnished with that most tantalising of things, the human voice.</p> <h2>Talk with electricity</h2> <p>It is no surprise to me that our voices are reinscribing themselves in the ways we choose to communicate with one another. After all, the telephone remains, I believe, one of the great wonders of the modern age &ndash; a device that brings people closer together at the same time as reminding them how far apart they are. Like something from a fairy tale, a telephone call is a granted wish that withholds as much as it gives.</p> <p>As is usually the case in a good fairy tale, the result is happiness forestalled. But then the telephone has always been associated with a kind of longing &ndash; for human contact, if not intimacy. The very first words spoken down a telephone line (by Alexander Graham Bell to his assistant in the neighbouring room) were &ldquo;Mr Watson &ndash; come here &ndash; I want to see you.&rdquo; How many people in the 150 years since then have cried forlornly into their telephone, wishing they could see or touch or be with the person on the other end of the line?</p> <p>Paradoxically, the intimation of this distance can give a telephone call a closeness that cannot be experienced in any other way. Bell called his invention &ldquo;talk with electricity&rdquo; and anyone who has stayed up too late talking on the phone would surely agree with him. An exchange of love letters might be romantic, but only the telephone really embodies all of love&rsquo;s fervour and its anxiety, all its awkwardness. The headset cradled against your ear. The feeling of being very vulnerable and very excited at the same time.</p> <p>And yet, by the time the 21st century was in full swing, this wondrous device appeared to be in terminal decline. Who or what killed the telephone call? Was it Drew Barrymore, crying into the phone in terror in the 1996 blockbuster <em>Scream</em>, and the deluge of prank calls that followed? Are Apple and Samsung to blame? The first smartphone could be bought in 1994, but only later were these handsets designed primarily as devices for watching, reading, touching and taking photographs, rather than talking. Smartphones today are not actually that convenient for making phone calls, and certainly not as pleasant as a traditional landline phone to hold to your ear for long periods.</p> <h2>Quality of connection</h2> <p>Writing in the <em>Atlantic</em> in 2015, Ian Bogost claimed that the cause for the decline in telephone calls was the quality of connection. The shift from landlines to mobile phones required the transition from a stable and dependable network of wires to a cellular one that bounced calls erratically through the ether. And whereas a landline compels us to remain indoors, mobile phones enable us to be out in the world where interferences, sonic or otherwise, are manifold.</p> <p>But of course, talking on the phone whilst walking down the street was precisely the thing that made mobile phones so appealing. Suddenly, you could talk on the train, in the park, on a bad date &ndash; even at the movies, as long as you didn&rsquo;t mind the dirty looks. But such pursuit of ease and efficiency is never-ending. More than this, texts and emails enable the author (and the recipient) to retain a greater degree of control over their interaction. What SMS began, internet messaging services like WhatsApp have accelerated. In 2022, roughly 100 billion WhatsApp messages were sent every single day.</p> <p>The voice note might be thought of, then, as a reflection of all we have lost as we drifted away from the phone call. Whilst retaining comfort and convenience, they inject a new kind of intimacy &ndash; something a little more human than a winky face emoji. As with a telephone call, we are speaking with no social cues to guide or reassure us, and none of the shared distractions that cushion our face-to-face conversations &ndash; a coffee to stir, a window to look out of. We cannot compensate for nerves with energy or affection, or try to gauge the mood of the person sitting opposite. There is only our voice. Everything else is stripped away.</p> <p>What is lost, however, is spontaneity. In the vacuum of a telephone call, you are required to improvise. You cannot spend hours, or even days, preparing exactly the right wording. A conversation on the telephone can feel like a high-wire act with the safety net removed. And yet we do it together, reaching out our hands and guiding each other through the darkness &ndash; the awkward pauses, the misunderstandings.</p> <p>Voice notes retain all the potential for misunderstanding and disconnection, but without the shared space to figure our way through. There is too much room to hide, or simply disappear. A telephone call asks something different of us; something we often think we hate, but perhaps we also need. It asks that we keep going &ndash; improvising, listening and being listened to &ndash; until we both know the conversation is over and, with a click, or simply a silence, the line can finally go dead.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from Andy Field&rsquo;s new book &ldquo;Encounterism&rdquo; (September Publishing), from the summer 2023 issue of New Humanist. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe now.</a></em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Credit: Alamy" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/shamanism-sq.jpg" height="1368" alt="Wooden shamanic totem poles in Siberia" width="1368"></p> <p>Rhonda McCrimmon, from Dundee, has 180,000 TikTok followers. Some of them are doctors, others are teachers, lecturers or social workers. They are all looking for spiritual guidance. McCrimmon is a self-styled Shaman, and posts videos on connecting with spirit guides, power animals and cauldron healing. &ldquo;One of the beautiful things about Shamanism is that it doesn&rsquo;t come from anywhere,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It just is, and has existed for as long as anybody knows. It is not exclusive to one culture or ethnicity.&rdquo; She is popular, with more than 1.5 million TikTok likes, and expensive too &ndash; charging clients &pound;3,500 for Shamanic practitioner courses lasting 20 months. Yet a growing body of opinion would question whether she knows what she is talking about.</p> <p>In recent years, Shamanism has drawn attention, attracting celebrity followers including Jennifer Lawrence and Daniel Craig. In November, Princess Martha of Norway quit royal duties to focus on a Shamanic healing business with her Shaman fianc&eacute;. And this interest is set to increase, if the 2021 UK census is a benchmark. It showed that over the past decade, there has been a 12-fold increase in British people stating their religion as Shamanism, from 650 in 2011 to 8,000 in 2021. Notably, this did not involve ticking a box, but writing their religion into a free-text space. Other nature-based religions also grew, but did not get the same traction. Paganism, which has European roots, increased its adherents by a quarter. The number of Wiccans grew by nearly 8 per cent.</p> <p>Behind the headlines, however, Shamanism&rsquo;s complex origins are surprising and rarely understood. Dr Susannah Crockford is a senior lecturer in anthropology at the University of Exeter. She says that the word &ldquo;Shaman&rdquo; originated with the Tungusic people of Siberia and referred to that community&rsquo;s Indigenous spiritual practitioners. When the Russian conquest of Siberia occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries, Europeans returned to their homelands with stories of Shamans. &ldquo;But in a very racist fashion, they laughed at them,&rdquo; says Crockford. &ldquo;The image of the Shaman became known in European literary circles.&rdquo;</p> <p>Fast-forward to the 20th century, and European anthropologists were observing and writing about other cultures. On seeing Indigenous spiritual practitioners in other parts of the world, they labelled them all &ldquo;Shamans&rdquo;. &ldquo;They used this word to describe spiritual practitioners across North America, South America and south-east Asia,&rdquo; Crockford says. &ldquo;None of these people used the word Shaman themselves, it was a colonial imposition on global practices that had Indigenous names. That is why you will find a broad diversity of practices under this label &lsquo;Shamanism&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p> <h2>The bibles of western Shamanism</h2> <p>For western Shamans, Indigenous spiritual practices from around the world have been conveniently &ndash; and questionably &ndash; condensed into two books that serve as the bibles for their beliefs. In 1964, the Romanian historian Mircea Eliade published Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy. Differing Indigenous spiritual practices were merged in this book, yet it developed a following in 1960s America. It was another book, however, which became the blueprint for Shamanic practice in western societies. In 1980, the American anthropologist Michael Harner published The Way of the Shaman.</p> <p>&ldquo;Harner translated the Indigenous religions as he understood them, and then mashed them together,&rdquo; says James L. Cox, emeritus professor of religions at the University of Edinburgh, who has a specialist research interest in Indigenous religions. &ldquo;Harner turned Indigenous practices &ndash; which tended to be about solving community problems, for example, a lack of rain or another person&rsquo;s illness &ndash; into an individualistic practice. In this western 1980s version of Shamanism, you could go to a weekend workshop and discuss your personal problems . . . It is a form of modern therapy where you discuss yourself in a group.&rdquo;</p> <p>Harner describes &ldquo;trance&rdquo; as key to unlocking the insights of western Shamanism. In this altered state, the individual is alert but experiences ecstasy through drumming, rattling, dancing and singing &ldquo;power songs&rdquo;. Later on in the book, readers are guided to communicate with rocks to solve their life problems: by picking up a big stone, asking it a question, and then watching it for visions. According to Harner Shamans in the west can also find their personal &ldquo;power animal&rdquo; by shaking a rattle and dancing like an animal of their choice. He writes that Shamans should &ldquo;experience the emotions of the animal, and don&rsquo;t hesitate to make the cries or noises of it, if you experience the desire.&rdquo;</p> <p>The book relies heavily on detailing the practices of North American and Amazonian tribes. In the opening, Harner recognises this, but adds that those who follow the techniques will not be simply &ldquo;playing Indian&rdquo;, but having the same &ldquo;revelatory&rdquo; experience, based on &ldquo;methods learnt from South and North American Indians&rdquo;.</p> <p>Shannon O&rsquo;Loughlin is a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, in the United States, and CEO of the Association on American Indian Affairs. &ldquo;Shamanism itself is a colonial word. It is a misrepresentation and appropriation of Indigenous world views,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The taking of Native ceremonies and using them for commercial or ego-driven practices is harmful to Native Nations, and to those non-Native persons using them without consent.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Power animals and lunar energies</h2> <p>Dr Karen Ward disagrees that her Shamanic practice culturally appropriates. She is a doctor of philosophy at Dublin City University, a psychotherapist, and identifies as an Irish Celtic Shaman. &ldquo;If you can trace your lineage to something then you&rsquo;re not appropriating,&rdquo; she says, adding that &ldquo;people should namecheck the traditions they use&rdquo; in order to acknowledge their origins. &ldquo;For me, Celtic Shamanism can be practised by going to Stonehenge on winter solstice, working with lunar energies, or by sitting in a circle &ndash; where there is no priest or hierarchy &ndash; and connecting with each other, and really listening to one another, giving another person in my circle that time. My ancestors would have done these things, I can trace my lineage back to all these traditions and not appropriate other cultures.&rdquo;</p> <p>However, there is little evidence of such ancient European practices, according to both Professor Cox and Dr Crockford. &ldquo;People will call themselves Celtic Shamans,&rdquo; says Crockford. &ldquo;But it is very sketchy archaeologically and historically. We do not know that Druids existed, let alone their spiritual beliefs. So to reconstruct this as an ancient religion is an imaginative process. A lot of the practices that you will find in Celtic Shaman circles are strikingly like those detailed in Eliade and Harner&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;</p> <p>Crockford notes that spirituality has taken off on social media. WitchTok is a spiritual community on TikTok that has received billions of views. &ldquo;Just look at WitchTok,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Combined with the celebrity influence, it has become trendy. Those charging for Shamanism courses are like influencers. They are on the same channels &ndash; YouTube, Instagram, TikTok. They will get money from ad revenue, and sell spiritual readings over Zoom and Facebook groups. Look at who takes these [courses] and who is making money, though. You cannot help but notice, it is usually white, English-speaking, middle- or upper-class people.&rdquo;</p> <p>O&rsquo;Loughlin adds that name-checking is not enough. &ldquo;Simply naming, &lsquo;I have stolen this from Native Peoples&rsquo; does not resolve or mitigate the harm,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Alleged traditional teachings from books, websites or from non-Native Peoples are simply not authentic. The value of these ceremonies is questionable and meaningless. Instead of practising &lsquo;Shamanism&rsquo;, start living minimally. Respect, and stop appropriating &ndash; especially for profit &ndash; from other cultures.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/life-is-hard.jpg" height="499" alt="The cover of 'Life is Hard' has an illustration of a hummingbird and a thistle" width="312"></strong></p> <p><strong>Life is Hard: How Philosophy Can Help Us Find Our Way</strong> (Hutchinson Heinemann) by Kieran Setiya</p> <p>Kieran Setiya is an accomplished analytic philosopher and, increasingly, one of the finest public philosophers working today. His latest book, <em>Life Is Hard</em>, was written during the pandemic and its title certainly captures the present mood. But Setiya doesn&rsquo;t just mean that life is hard now. After all, haven&rsquo;t infirmity, grief and injustice always been with us, and won&rsquo;t they remain so? Setiya&rsquo;s focus is on the core features of life that make it seemingly inevitably hard.</p> <p>The book is a rich and rewarding read, reckoning with everything from personal failure to the meaning of life. The philosophy is fed by examples from Setiya&rsquo;s life: his teenage heartbreak, the onset in his twenties of chronic and excruciating pelvic pain, his mother&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, his involvement in climate activism.</p> <p>Setiya is surely right that there are hardships that almost all lives will face, sooner or later; such is the human condition. His aim is to help us in &ldquo;making the best of a bad lot&rdquo;. He examines the ingredients that make life hard one by one, but what emerges is a view of life as a whole: humanistic, rooted in our social nature, and notably influenced by the novelist and philosopher Iris Murdoch. And if you have a stereotype of the philosophy professor as coldly rationalistic, then the centrality that Setiya gives to love might surprise you. &ldquo;We are made for love,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;and we are lost without it.&rdquo; Personally, I most often found his remarks to be moving and true. Some, perhaps, might find the book overly sentimental.</p> <p><em>Life Is Hard</em> reveals the benefits of bringing careful analysis to the problems of life, but it also shows that this kind of philosophy calls for emotional intelligence. What it offers, ultimately, is consolation by acknowledgement. Setiya doesn&rsquo;t try to magic away the problem of grief, for example, as the Stoic philosopher Epictetus did. Rather, he gives us words to understand our grief better, and so perhaps helps us live with the reality of love and loss. He supports this perspective throughout with a wonderful diversity of sources from literature, social science, psychology and history &ndash; from the Bhagavad Gita to Gerrard Winstanley to Annie Ernaux.</p> <p>The discussion of failure is particularly illuminating. Setiya seeks to demonstrate how philosophy can liberate us, by showing that it&rsquo;s a mistake to think of our lives in terms of one big narrative, at the end of which we&rsquo;re either &ldquo;winners&rdquo; or &ldquo;losers&rdquo;. He also highlights the social forces that encourage us to think this way. Indeed, he shows how we must move beyond the logic of the self-help genre, by insisting on the social source of our problems and, where possible, their social remedy.</p> <p>This is why Setiya looks outward as well as inward, in part because when you look inward what you discover is how the world out there has made you. Perhaps the book&rsquo;s vision is most inspiring and ambitious when he argues that the meaning of life itself is ultimately a political issue. <em>Life Is Hard</em> makes a compelling case that whether human life is meaningful depends on whether we give it meaning by collectively striving towards justice for humanity as a whole. Here, unlike in the case of our individual life stories, Setiya encourages us to think of the human story in terms of a grand narrative. He acknowledges the similarities with those great German philosophers Hegel and Marx, but unlike them he doesn&rsquo;t see any historical destination as inevitable. It all depends on whether we get our act together.</p> <p><em>Life Is Hard</em> is a weighty and satisfying book. Some people might find it a little too earnest, even with Setiya&rsquo;s likeable sense of humour. The seriousness feels so mandatory that it is tempting to rebel against it. Life is hard, the title tells us, and Setiya offers no superficial escapes.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>I am delighted to say that the second series of our On Your Mind podcast has launched today!!</p>



<p>Each week, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will explore aspects of the human psyche, including astrology, how the clothes we wear influence our thoughts, attraction, friendship, dreaming, mind control and much much more.  We will also be joined by some special guests as we attempt to answer all of your questions about psychology. The first series reached No.1 in Apple Podcast’s Science charts, and so we hope that you can join us. </p>



<p>Our first episode looks at creativity and explores how to have good ideas and whether children are more creative than adults. You can listen <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2txmeCf9U2rj4aAdMLoczK">here</a>.</p>

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>
<p>The book is available in the UK <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Why-Matters-Richard-Wiseman/dp/1509550437">here</a>. </p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->
