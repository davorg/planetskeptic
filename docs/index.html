<p class="lead">Look to the right. If you ever wanted to see a pair of gold-plated smirking morons, there they are. Those two, <a href="https://julesevans.medium.com/the-religion-of-the-future-police-7882048fd9a3">Malcolm and Simone Collins, were cooked in the crucible of weird Silicon Valley culture</a> &#8212; he was a manager at Google, while she worked for Peter Thiel &#8212; and they came up with a techno-fetishist cult built on their misunderstanding of science. It&#8217;s a horror story.</p>
<blockquote><p>Googleplex, the Google HQ in Mountain View, California, is an incubator for new religious movements. Ten years ago, Google hired Ray Kurzweil, prophet of the Singularity. In 2015, Google engineer Anthony Levandowski started The Way of the Future, a church to worship super-intelligent AI. And now we have the Religion of the Future Police, began by former Google manager Malcolm Collins and his wife Simone.</p>
<p>The Collinses came to my attention last month, thanks to a great article by Julia Black in Business Insider, called ‘Can Super Babies Save the World’. They’re the founders of pronatalist.org, and part of a pronatalist movement growing in Silicon Valley and around the world. Pronatalists think the world is facing a population crisis: not too many people, but too few. They think civilization is threatened because of lowering birth rates, ageing populations and plummeting male fertility (average sperm count fell 50% between 1973 and 2019, and no one is sure why).</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I might be persuaded that the carrying capacity of the planet might be somewhat greater than the current number of 7.9 billion, but <em>only</em> if there was a more equitable division of wealth &#8212; the rich are resource hogs &#8212; and if we made a concerted effort to develop more sustainable technologies. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think a pair of smug Silicon Valley smegholes would go along with that. I also think that all you have to do is examine the dismal prospects of climate change and environmental decline to see we can&#8217;t sustain the current population, so blithely suggesting we can just increase it more without consequences is insane.</p>
<p>Also, can I just say that naming your cult <q>The Religion of Future Police</q> sounds rather fascist?</p>
<p>These people are basically long-termists who are open about one of their goals. They aren&#8217;t just trying to expand humanity as a whole, they specifically want their own personal lineage to take over the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>as long as each of their descendants can commit to having at least eight children for just 11 generations, the Collins bloodline will eventually outnumber the current human population. If they succeed, Malcolm continued, ‘we could set the future of our species’.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their math is sort of right &#8211; 8 kids per child per generation for 11 generations is 8,589,934,592, or 8&frac12; billion descendants. Imagine pressuring your children with the requirement that they must have at least 8 kids each! Unfortunately, they don&#8217;t carry through on the calculation. Since each generation after the first is only going to be half Collins (unless they&#8217;re also going to encourage incest), the individuals in that last generation are only going to be 0.0098% Collins, assuming there&#8217;s no interbreeding at all, which is unlikely given they&#8217;ll constitute a population of over 8 billion people. It&#8217;s a silly and innumerate endeavor. 99% of that 11th generation are going to be derived from genetic contributions from all the other people on Earth, and with any luck they&#8217;ll completely dilute out the taint of the Collins Family insanity.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also open about trying to &#8216;improve&#8217; the genetics of their children with crude engineering. Very crude. They don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing at all.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re making children through IVF, which produces as many as a dozen fertilized eggs in a dish which can then be implanted back into Simone. A cell can be taken from each developing embryo and subjected to sequence analysis, and then they pore over the list of alleles and pick the very best super-baby combination. Or they think they do. We can&#8217;t do the kind of prediction of traits from raw genomic data that they are imagining.</p>
<blockquote><p>Probably the most controversial part of their plan is their embrace of genetic enhancement for their children, something which they say is a secret pursuit among the tech rich. ‘We are the Underground Railroad of ‘Gattaca’ babies and people who want to do genetic stuff with their kids,’ Malcolm said. They used a company called Genomic Prediction, started by physicist Steve Hsu, which offers polygenic risk scores on embryos. Julia Black writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though Genomic Prediction’s “LifeView” test officially offers risk scores only for 11 polygenic disorders — including schizophrenia and five types of cancer — they allowed the Collinses to access the raw genetic data for their own analysis. Simone and Malcolm then took their data export to a company called SelfDecode, which typically runs tests on adult DNA samples, to analyze what the Collinses called “the fun stuff.”</p>
<p>Sitting on the couch, Simone pulled up a spreadsheet filled with red and green numbers. Each row represented one of their embryos from the sixth batch, and the columns a variety of relative risk factors, from obesity to heart disease to headaches. The Collinses’ top priority was one of the most disputed categories: what they called “mental-performance-adjacent traits,” including stress, chronically low mood, brain fog, mood swings, fatigue, anxiety, and ADHD. With a large number of green columns and a score of 1.9, Embryo №3 — aka Titan Invictus (an experiment in nominative determinism) — was selected to become the Collinses’ third child.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh god, <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2020/06/16/hsu-is-rightfully-embattled-he-shouldnt-have-any-authority/"><em>Stephen Hsu</em></a>? they&#8217;re taking genetic advice from a racist physicist? All the traits they think they are selecting for are complex polygenic behavioral phenomena, products of currently uninterpretable combinatorial interactions. They think they&#8217;re being rational and logical by making choices based on numerical scores, but it&#8217;s all garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>Cocky little ignoramuses, aren&#8217;t they? Just the sort to base their life choices on a religion.</p>
<p>I wondered how they were paying for all this gee-whiz techno pseudo-science? Easy. They&#8217;re running a religious grift.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today they live in a farmhouse in Philadelphia with three children and a fourth on the way. They’re launching a VC fund and accepting enrollments for The Collins Institute School for the Gifted, a $20,000-a-year course in homeschooling which teaches students math, coding, how to pitch, how to run successful email campaigns, and other life-skills. They’re also running a match-making service for alpha adults, and they’ve launched their own religion with an elaborate theology <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cp2b12yTKwXfgIQmt96uCPI2sstgu4HiysyJ8mLXCWw/edit#">described in a GoogleDoc</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re selling a $20,000 course in homeschooling! You know, sending your kids to a public school is a better investment &#8212; they&#8217;ll get qualified teachers who are regularly assessed, and a curriculum set by state standards. I know, sometimes public schools can be awful for many kids, but it&#8217;s not because they lack a good framework. It&#8217;s because other people can be assholes.</p>
<p>A homeschool run by those two arrogant know-nothings, though, is guaranteed to have an enriched population of privileged assholes.</p>
<p>Their status as confirmed assholes can be determined by reading their <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cp2b12yTKwXfgIQmt96uCPI2sstgu4HiysyJ8mLXCWw/edit#"><i>Collins Family Theology</i></a> document. It&#8217;s a turgid, pretentious mess that makes sweeping pronouncements about human nature, bolstered by a few citations to short science articles which I can tell you, he uses inappropriately. Malcolm Collins has a painfully linear and determinist view of genetics. For instance,</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Our culture also resists instinctual attachment to biological identity, instead contextualizing children as more “us” than we—our present biological bundles—are. Consider that each biological kid you have is 50% you. As soon as you have more than three kids, there is more of your biological identity (1.5X) in them than there is in you.
</p></blockquote>
<p>By coincidence, I happen to have three kids. That does not mean 1.5 copies of me exist &#8212; each one is a unique combinations of genes and experience. You cannot quantify &#8220;biological identity&#8221; in that simple-minded way!</p>
<p>What they&#8217;re doing is building a relabeled version of eugenics, based on the same conceptual errors as the original eugenics. They&#8217;re making the same horrific categorizations that the Nazis did. If you don&#8217;t accept their views, then you&#8217;re a <q>husk</q> &#8212; something non-human.</p>
<blockquote><p>They call their religion ‘secular Calvinism’ — interestingly, the scientist JBS Haldane called eugenics ‘scientific Calvinism’ in the 1920s. They believe the ultimate good in the universe is ‘sapience’. More humans = more sapience. More educated and more free-thinking humans = even more sapience. Intelligent, free-thinking humans are better, according to this theology, than conformist dull-witted herd-humans, or what the Collinses call ‘husks’:</p>
<blockquote class="creationist">
<p>we call them a “husk” because when someone halts the process of creative destruction — refusing to explore, weigh, and sometimes to accept new ideas — they stop being meaningfully human (in our House’s view, at least).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When eugenicists say that people who think differently to them are ‘husks’ who have ‘stopped being meaningfully human’, that’s a red flag folks!</p></blockquote>
<p>To make it a little bit worse, their kids are taught to idolize the Future Police, an imagined population in the far distant future who are looking back and judging them for how well they assist their destiny in coming to be.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist">
<p>Future police as a family tradition are also very useful in conveying more complex concepts exemplifying our Secular Calvinist cultural framework (such as predestination, the future that must come to pass, and the Elect) in ways that a child can easily understand. For example, it is easy to explain to a kid why the Future Police have no motivation to protect an individual who lives only for themselves or their immediate community instead of the future of the species and their family. The concept of Future Police can be used to teach kids to constantly consider how their actions impact humanity in both the near and distant future.</p>
<p>Future Police also allow for fun family holiday traditions. For example, at the beginning of each year, our family has a celebration in which we combine common New Year&#8217;s traditions (such as making commitments to the future) with Future Police motifs, encouraging our kids to “prove their dedication to the future” to these distant descendents in order to curry their favor and secure gifts and privileges.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Fun.&#8221; And then they all join in a rousing chorus of <a href="youtube.com/watch?v=_tUctFu46_c"><i>Tomorrow Belongs to Me</i></a>. I call it terrifying children with threats of the Future Police judging them for failing to curry favor. This is just the same old fucked-up Christian guilt-trip.</p>
<p>Sure, Googleplex is an incubator for new religious movements, but they&#8217;re all loony as hell, all seem to converge on the same ol&#8217; authoritarian cultishness, and I hope they all die and fade away.</p>

<p>If this works, it&#8217;ll revolutionize my classes. Hire a stripper to walk around lamenting that she doesn&#8217;t understand Poisson distributions or how to get a p value from that set of data, and presto, we&#8217;re done!</p>
<p>Except for one catch. I just checked my class list, and 71% of my students are young women, maybe some are lesbians, but that isn&#8217;t recorded in the class data.</p>
<p>Would it work if <em>I</em> traipsed around the classroom in a unitard?</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">You want to see something awesome? This is a video of human embryonic cells developing in a dish and activating the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05649-2">segmentation clock</a> to build a series of somites.</p>
<div class="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYZt5ygmaTA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>That embryos do this is pretty neat but not surprising. It&#8217;s easy to see that process going on in zebrafish embryos, where a new segmental blob pinches off every 20 minutes.  What&#8217;s cool is that they&#8217;ve pared down the system to just what looks like presomitic mesoderm &#8212; no gut endoderm, no nervous system or ectoderm, just those mesodermal cells grouping and organizing to make pre-muscle tissue. At first, I thought, no big deal. We&#8217;ve observed vertebrate segmentation in fish and frogs and chicks for many decades, why would we need to look at it in human embryos? They almost certainly use the same molecules and interactions as mice or any other vertebrate. It&#8217;s got to be using <i>Notch</i> signaling, after all.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s special here, though, is that they&#8217;ve reduced the complexity of the system to a remarkable degree. You don&#8217;t need a nervous system or a gut or even, it seems, a notochord to assemble segmental organization. They&#8217;re even getting colinear expression of HOX genes! That&#8217;s the surprise to me, that so little is required to trigger oscillatory expression and patterning. And that&#8217;s the point the authors emphasize.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our bottom-up experimental approach demonstrates that complex developmental events such as somitogenesis, can be deconstructed and dissected into discrete “building blocks” of developmental principles which are usually intricately connected and cannot be easily uncoupled in vivo. Axioloids, a self-organizing in vitro model of human axial development allowed us to individually assess and manipulate such building blocks at the molecular, cellular and morphogenetic level. Axioloids -a surrogate model of the human embryonic tail and forming axis- are capable of recapitulating core features of human somitogenesis, and represent an exciting new platform to investigate axial development and disease in a human context.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t read the YouTube comments. There are people complaining that <q>it&#8217;s a human life with a unique genetic code</q> (no, it&#8217;s not a person, and these embryonic cultures cannot develop into a person &#8212; while scraps of mesoderm might be enough to make somites, it&#8217;s not sufficient to build a whole human being) and <q>Stop trying to PLAY GOD!!!</q> (this isn&#8217;t god-like, it&#8217;s <em>biology</em>).</p>

There are people &ndash; such as this reviewer &ndash; of middle age and upwards, who reached adulthood without Googling anything, sending an email, having a social media account or owning a mobile phone. We are the last of our kind: people for whom the default setting was being out of touch. At the opposite end of the spectrum are people in their mid-20s and younger, for whom the online realm is as taken for granted as electric light.</p> <p class="p6">The journalist Marie Le Conte is of the generation between. She was born in 1991, and reckons she probably went online for the first time later that decade: a point at which the internet, as she notes, was still routinely capitalised as the Internet, much as baffled parents of earlier decades might have fretfully discussed Rock And Roll. New technologies are usually first adopted and appropriated by the young: Le Conte launched a blog when she was 12, and a website largely concerned with indie rock when she was 15. She was among the pathfinders who first used MSN Messenger, MySpace and Tumblr, and now presides over nearly 90,000 followers on Twitter. &ldquo;I was born and bred online,&rdquo; she writes in the introduction, &ldquo;and if you remove the life I have led on there, it leaves me with no life at all.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p6">This is a statement of fact, not a plea for sympathy. Le Conte is emphatic that her time online has largely been a tremendous hoot, and has the anecdotes to prove it. But in her telling of how the internet changed during that period, something of the indie rock website editor can be discerned. Le Conte&rsquo;s view of the internet now is similar to that of the early fan of a once obscure band that is now monstrously famous, who finds themselves jammed into some cavernous arena peevishly seething, &ldquo;Who are all these bloody people?&rdquo; (Le Conte, whose droll self-mockery is a strength of <em>Escape</em>, would probably not object to this characterisation.)</p> <p class="p6">Le Conte uses a mixture of interviews with others and personal reflections to chart the internet&rsquo;s trajectory from its Wild West period as a vast landscape of discrete communities, each with their own rules, conventions and traditions, to today&rsquo;s much more centralised arrangement where much if not most online activity is filtered through less than a handful of social media platforms. The villages have become a megalopolis. Just like city living offline, this has advantages: you frequently bump into people, ideas and opinions you would not normally have sought out. It also has disadvantages: exactly the same thing.</p> <p class="p6">Humanity has been living in three-dimensional big cities a good while now, and has by and large developed the key necessary quality: indifference. The deal is basically that our fellow citizens may say, do, believe, worship, wear, consume and love what they please so long as they don&rsquo;t bother us with it. Online, you may have noticed, it does not work like that: social media is plagued by people for whom being performatively angry in public, very often about total bullshit, has become a hobby, and/or a job.</p> <p class="p6">Le Conte takes issue, and persuasively so, with the conventional wisdom that social media has insulated us all in echo chambers. The actual difficulty, she suggests, is the opposite: &ldquo;There is a fundamental problem with how we live online, and it is that we are now all together, all of the time.&rdquo; Le Conte illustrates this via relating her own role in one of the inadvertent sitcoms often catalysed by social media: she posted a whimsical tweet about the mixed blessing of living within earshot of an opera singer, it was eventually retweeted into the timeline of another opera singer, and Le Conte duly found herself indignantly addressed by wrathful opera singers. The serious point: &ldquo;Our spaces make us feel tense because we never feel truly safe in them anymore.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p6"><em>Escape</em> is a smart and funny analysis of a very modern phenomenon, but it&rsquo;s also a tale as old as time: of us letting something get worse because it was easy, cheap and convenient to do so.</p> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Still from Nathan Fielder's comedy show " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/nathan-fielder_0.jpg" height="1064" alt="Still from Nathan Fielder's 'The Rehearsal'" width="1596"></p> <p class="p1">How best to explain <em>The Rehearsal</em>? Comedian Nathan Fielder&rsquo;s new HBO show doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to easy summary. The show begins with a simple conceit: Fielder helps everyday people prepare for big personal challenges by meticulously rehearsing them. But, when the situations become ever more complicated and the elaborate rehearsals spiral out of control, the show blurs the line between performance and reality. In one heartbreaking instance, a young child actor involved in a parenting &ldquo;rehearsal&rdquo; seems unable to recognise that Fielder isn&rsquo;t his real father.</p> <p class="p3"><em>The Rehearsal</em> is emblematic of a perceptible change in modern comedy. We are increasingly fascinated with the comedy of real life; authentic portrayals of the messy business of being alive.</p> <p class="p3">Fielder is a Canadian comedian with an exaggeratedly awkward, monotonous delivery, whose reputation before <em>The Rehearsal </em>was founded on the four seasons of his superlative Comedy Central show <em>Nathan For You</em>, in which he &ldquo;helps&rdquo; American business owners. His solutions begin with a certain twisted logic but descend by the end into a circus of the absurd.</p> <p class="p3">In one of my favourite set-ups, he attempts to help the owner of a small electronics store. His advice is to use the retail giant Best Buy&rsquo;s price-match policy against them, pricing all the televisions at $1 so that Best Buy have to do the same. The plan is to purchase all the bargains from Best Buy, and then mark them up. But, once the small store slashes their prices to $1, Fielder has to prevent customers immediately buying the televisions, so he sets up an obstacle course that includes a tiny door and a live alligator.</p> <p class="p3">Fielder also executive-produced <em>How To with John Wilson</em>, a comedy documentary series now on BBC iPlayer. Always behind the camera, Wilson chronicles life in New York, using his footage to tell a themed story in each episode. Other than Wilson&rsquo;s narration (more intentionally awkward and unpolished than Fielder&rsquo;s), there is no acting on display: what we see for the most part is real New Yorkers going about their day, made to look absurd through Wilson&rsquo;s lens. A woman carrying a pillow down the street. A man who has tied a clear bag of bread around a handrail on the subway. It&rsquo;s all funny because it&rsquo;s all true.</p> <h2 class="p4">Slices of believable life</h2> <p class="p5">What makes <em>The Rehearsal</em> and Fielder&rsquo;s other work so effective is that we are watching real people through the prism of an unusual mind. Neither Wilson nor Fielder are purveyors of the comedy of cringe, as perfected by Ricky Gervais in <em>The Office</em>. Something different is going on here.</p> <p class="p3">It&rsquo;s a fascinating time for comedy, a genre that depends to a large extent on subverting expectations. The contemporary decline in studio sitcoms like <em>Fawlty Towers</em> and <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> has been well documented, with the popularity of dark, character-driven comedies like <em>Fleabag</em> both explaining and capitalising on this shift. For a while, it seems, audiences have been less and less keen on being reminded of a show&rsquo;s inherent artifice. Thirty years ago, if you launched a sitcom, you&rsquo;d have a studio audience. In 2022, thanks to shows like <em>The Royle Family, The Office</em> and <em>The Thick of It</em>, the aim is the exact opposite: construct a world that makes the audience feel as though they are a fly on the wall. There are exceptions &ndash; <em>Mrs Brown&rsquo;s Boys</em> is hugely popular &ndash; but the contemporary drift towards single-camera naturalism is unmistakable.</p> <p class="p3">Equally difficult to ignore is the preponderance of the panel show, a low-stakes way of making audiences laugh. One of the biggest comedy phenomena in recent years is Channel 4&rsquo;s <em>Taskmaster</em>, in which five celebrities &ndash; mostly comedians &ndash; complete a series of bizarre challenges. Not a show that naturally invites comparisons to Fielder&rsquo;s work, it is nonetheless joyful because we see comedians dropping the mask and responding to insane challenges as themselves. For similar reasons, the BBC1 panel show <em>Would I Lie to You?</em> is unendingly popular: audiences like pondering what&rsquo;s true and what&rsquo;s not, again watching comedians play heightened versions of themselves.</p> <p class="p3">The common denominator here is authenticity: panel shows thrive on their relatability; single-camera sitcoms are appealling for their ability to depict slices of believable life. What falls between the two stools is the theatricality of the studio sitcom.</p> <p class="p5">This balance between the real and the artificial occurs in every medium. In the world of fine art, expressionism was in part a reaction against naturalism. Are Fielder, Wilson et al<em> </em>the expressionists or the naturalists here? An argument could be mounted for both.</p> <p class="p3">Studio sitcoms are never fully able to escape their artifice, but there are interesting examples that push at the limits of the form, such as the recent comedy drama <em>Kevin Can F**k Himself,</em> divided between a fake studio set and the grimmer reality on the other side of its doors. The show has been rightly praised for deconstructing the much-loved family sitcom, in order to give us access to the inner world of the genre&rsquo;s traditional supporting character: the patient, put-upon wife. The show plays with our understanding of reality, much like a mockumentary, but is still firmly wedded to the studio space.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Real and on camera?</span></h2> <p class="p3">Outside of the confines of a television studio, there is arguably more freedom to make riskier choices. Both <em>The Rehearsal</em> and <em>How To with John Wilson</em> inspire fascinating questions about audiences and observation. Are their creators attempting to construct something that is as real as possible, or are they making the point that it can never truly be &ldquo;real&rdquo;, so long as there are cameras around?</p> <p class="p3">Because they do away with a studio audience and the rhythms to which the format adheres, shows like <em>The Rehearsal </em>and <em>How To with John Wilson</em> can be more audacious in how they swerve between comedy and drama &ndash; or even a kind of tragedy. Travelling around alone, Wilson&rsquo;s voiceover reflections on how to find meaning in life are often sweet and melancholic. In <em>The Rehearsal</em>, Fielder can flip from making a joke about oranges being Satanic, to wondering aloud about the nature of the self: &ldquo;I was starting to lose track of which version of myself I was supposed to be in these rehearsals.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p5">As <em>The Rehearsal</em> gets into its stride, it starts to ask more nuanced questions about reality. Take the elaborate parenting &ldquo;rehearsal&rdquo; Fielder runs for a woman about to be a mother. In order to simulate the experience through time, he uses actors of various ages, who are swapped in and out as the child &ldquo;grows&rdquo;. Fielder, meanwhile, plays the father. One child actor, too young to understand the conceit, can&rsquo;t stop calling him &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo; off camera, sending the programme into difficult waters.</p> <p class="p3">Fielder has been criticised for the ethics of his work, but <em>The Rehearsal</em> is notable for attempting to deal with this within the show. &ldquo;Do you want to feel something? Do you want to feel something real?&rdquo; one female actor asks Fielder as he begins to lose his grip on his increasingly complex experiment. This actor has been employed to rehearse the interactions Fielder is going to have with another woman playing the mother in the parenting simulation: rehearsals within rehearsals, for an authentic social interaction that may never arrive. In the inevitably feverish analysis<em>,</em> fans are asking if the &ldquo;real&rdquo; people in the show (such as the prospective mother) are in fact also performers.</p> <p class="p3">Both<em> The Rehearsal</em> and <em>How To with John Wilson </em>acknowledge that, in a world where we are bombarded with more content than ever, it is a challenge to distinguish between the real and the contrived. &ldquo;Unfortunately, most of what we take for spontaneity usually just turns out to be part of a meticulous plan,&rdquo; says Wilson in one of his episodes. It&rsquo;s a nod to an uncomfortable truth: we may never really know.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="A Roman Feast, by Roberto Bompiani (1821-1908)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/saturnalia-_2_.jpg" height="1035" alt="A Roman Feast (Saturnalia), Second Half of the 19th cen.. Creator: Bompiani, Roberto (1821-1908)" width="1596"></p> <p>It&rsquo;s that time again, when everyone is spinning in the maelstrom of cheesy TV commercials, crackers, Secret Santas, festive jumpers, hangovers &ndash; and a slew of seasonal anxieties. Will the cards arrive on time? Will the promised turkey materialise? Will the new robot come with batteries? And what on earth can you get for that difficult sister-in-law?</p> <p>But where, as a self-respecting sceptic, do you draw the line? You won&rsquo;t, presumably, display models of the manger and the shepherds in your front garden, nor an advent calendar on the mantlepiece to build anticipation for the miracle birth. Perhaps you might be tempted to attend Midnight Mass, just for the spectacle, or to go carol-singing because it&rsquo;s for charity. But will you be having a Christmas tree? And if so, how are you planning to decorate it?</p> <p>During these recession-plunged times, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend anything at all on fripperies. Instead you could just tart up your existing baubles. The Guardian shows you how to make paper snowflakes, and how to marble your balls. The website <em>YourHomeStyle </em>recommends using chalk paint to spray over the ornaments, or over the tree for a frosty look. And if you really want to cut down, they suggest, you could always make your own chalk paint which, they guarantee, will ensure your tree will look like nobody else&rsquo;s. Not always in a good way.</p> <p>For a natural look you don&rsquo;t need to spend any money at all. Just gather a few twigs, pine cones and springs of holly and smugly parade your green values. As long as you buy locally you could actually be helping the planet as many UK growers will plant new ones for every one cut down &ndash; up to 10 each tree according to the Woodland Trust.</p> <p>And real ones are far better than fake. The Carbon Trust calculates that a two-metre artificial tree has a carbon footprint of around 40kg, more than ten times that of a real tree that&rsquo;s burned after Christmas. Most artificial trees are made in China, with the dual environmental impact of being made from plastic, PVC and metal, and then shipped overseas. And they&rsquo;re not recyclable, so when they&rsquo;re inevitably thrown away, they end up in landfill.</p> <p>But why have a tree at all? Maybe you&rsquo;re a bit chary about joining in the collective worship of the baby Jesus, alongside all the paraphernalia of nativities, carol services and church-going. But if you do crave a tree you don&rsquo;t need to worry that you&rsquo;re subscribing to the Christian myth. Evergreen trees have been a potent symbol in numerous cultures across the world long before the birth in the stable. Christianity simply co-opted existing rituals and made them its own.</p> <p class="MsoCommentText">It wasn&rsquo;t until after 300 BC that the emperor Constantine made Christianity a State 'religion'. Before then, the Roman's winter celebration of Saturnalia bore striking similarities to our Christmas traditions today. People lit candles, gave gifts and decorated trees in honour of Saturn, the god of sewing and seeds. Saturnalia was for some time celebrated around the winter solstice in late December, and some have argued that it is the forebear of our Christmas tradition today. Equally, it could just be that humans down the centuries have liked to feast, drink, make fire and contemplate the regenerative power of nature at the darkest and bleakest point of the year.</p> <p>In the Middle East many civilisations worshipped a version of the goddess Asherah, the &ldquo;Queen of Heaven&rdquo;. Her main symbol was a pole or a tree, which the ancient Canaanites viewed as a signifier of fertility. Druids are thought to have believed that the white berries of mistletoe represented the semen of the gods. Wreaths, in the pagan tradition, were made in a circle to stand for female fertility.</p> <p class="MsoCommentText">Some pagans regard the red berries of the holly as a symbol of menstrual blood while Wiccans use holly wood to make wands. Both holly and mistletoe were hung in doorways of temples and homes to invoke powers of fertility in those who stood beneath and kissed, causing the spirits of the god and goddess to enter them.</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">The association of the evergreen fir with carnality hasn&rsquo;t entirely disappeared. A few years ago outraged residents of a northern town in Russia reacted furiously to the appearance of a phallic-looking Christmas tree outside the local concert hall. Some demanded that authorities remove the bizarre-shaped tree, which they nicknamed the &ldquo;penis fir&rdquo; because of its extremely bulbous bottom and shaft-like top.</p> <p>No wonder they were upset. Once Christianity had taken over, with its obsessive obliteration of sex, no such base allusions were allowed, so the phallic symbols were replaced by Biblical ones.</p> <p>Red berries came to represent the blood of Christ, and the pointy leaves the crown of thorns placed upon his head as he was crucified. Wreaths, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to learn, are no longer wombs. Instead they are a sign of God&rsquo;s eternal love.</p> <p>If you&rsquo;re finding all of this stifling symbolism too much to take, you can always create your own atheist semiotic code instead. Let&rsquo;s start with the evergreen tree itself which in all cultures means immortality and the promise of rebirth. So it&rsquo;s just as meaningful for humanists, as a celebration of the cycle of life. You&rsquo;re definitely okay with tinsel, too. Simply redefine it as a manifestation of religious superstition: a shiny rope winding over the leaves of logic.</p> <p>But what will you put on the top? Presumably not an angel which, in Christian iconography, refers to the one who appeared high in the sky on the first Christmas, heralding the birth of Jesus. A star? Sorry &ndash; the star represents the Star of Bethlehem, which guided the Three Wise Men to the stable where Jesus was born.</p> <p>Instead of these you could select a favourite secular saint. How about a figure of Einstein, to demonstrate the value of science? Or Emmeline Pankhurst for feminism? One year I draped a &ldquo;Votes for Women&rdquo; sash round the tree, but the masculine holly snagged it to shreds. For a different version of tribal worship why not a likeness of England football manager Gareth Southgate? These are easily available and probably, these days, cut price. If you don&rsquo;t want to invest in a real statue, just cut out a picture and paste it on to card. I once did that with a portrait of the American actress, writer and singer Mae West, proclaiming, &ldquo;I&lsquo;m no Angel.&rdquo;</p> <p class="trt0xe">That was just one of her proud boasts during her seven-decade entertainment career. She was famous for her outspoken sexual appetite and bawdy one-liners. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m good I&rsquo;m very good,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but when I&rsquo;m bad I&rsquo;m better.&rdquo; And, she explained, &ldquo;I used to be Snow White, but I drifted.&rdquo;</p> <p>And now to the lights. Christmas trees used to be decorated with candles, symbolising Jesus as a divine light, and the star that led the three wise men. Today&rsquo;s tree lights can also be seen as the stars and planets in the firmament. But for pagans, the use of light around the winter solstice represented the promise of light in the darkest time of year. Which couldn&rsquo;t be more humanist.</p> <p>So let your Christmas tree celebrate that most sacred of secular movements: the Enlightenment. Rejoice in the sign of the rebirth of science, the glory of human endeavour, the triumph of reason over superstition, and a promise of better, more rational times to come.</p> <p>Provided you don&rsquo;t get the ones that flicker.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><img title="Harvard University campus, 2009" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Harvard_University_campus-314.jpeg" height="668" alt="Harvard University campus" width="1019"></strong></span></p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Harvard&rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science (Rowman &amp; Littlefield) </strong></span><span class="s1">by Patrick L. Schmidt </span></p> <p class="p5">Harvard, a place of tradition and legacy, does not take kindly to proposals for major organisational restructuring. Yet, in 1946, a group of scholars did just that when they received permission to combine the disciplines of anthropology, sociology and social psychology into a single department. The birth, life and death of this department, called the Department of Social Relations, are described in detail in Patrick L. Schmidt&rsquo;s new book <em>Harvard&rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science</em>.</p> <p class="p6">It is no coincidence that Social Relations opened its doors after the Second World War, a conflict whose origins and implications Harvard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; &ndash; the disciplines of history, economics and government &ndash; struggled to explain. Social Relations not only copied an interdisciplinary model already in use at other Ivy Leagues, but also gave faculty the freedom to pursue emerging theories and areas of study that were not receiving adequate attention inside their respective departments.</p> <p class="p6">The department of psychology was especially narrowminded in this regard. Prior to the establishment of Social Relations, psychology at Harvard was dominated by experimental psychologists. They were called &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; not because they were interested in exploring uncharted territory, but because they wanted to study the human mind through observable behaviour only, pushing professors Henry Murray and Gordon Allport &ndash; interested in invisible mental processes &ndash; to join Social Relations.</p> <p class="p6">Schmidt captures the intellectual drama that accompanied the development of the department. Conflicts of interest or ideas are thoroughly explained and livened up with quotes from faculty. Especially memorable is the recollection of Allport&rsquo;s awkward meeting with Sigmund Freud, whose fixation with the unconscious bothered him almost as much as Harvard&rsquo;s focus on behaviour.</p> <p class="p6">In theory, Social Relations was meant to be an interdisciplinary program. In practice, it was more multidisciplinary, with students and teachers sticking to their primary disciplines. One of the department&rsquo;s founders, sociologist Talcott Parsons, wrote <em>Towards a General Theory of Social Action</em> in an attempt to unify the discipline, and create <br>&ldquo;social relations&rdquo; as a new science, but the social psychologists in the department remained unconvinced, as did many sociologists.</p> <p class="p6">Why write a book about a failed intellectual project? Firstly, because of what was achieved along the way. Internal division did not stop the Department of Social Relations from delivering outstanding scholarship. As the Iron Curtain dropped, the department&rsquo;s Russian Research Center provided Washington with intel on the Soviet Union. Led by anthropologist and Social Relations founder Clyde Kluckhohn, the centre studied all aspects of Soviet life to determine how it would respond to attacks from the American military. Scholars say it showed research can be politically motivated while still being academically sound.</p> <p class="p6">Social Relations disintegrated in the early 1970s when anthropology, sociology and social psychology were once again separated into their own departments. This was due in part to a PR crisis which ensued after professors Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) gave psilocybin and mescaline to undergraduates as part of their Harvard Psychedelic Project, promoting drug use on university grounds and establishing themselves as counterculture icons.</p> <p class="p6">At the time, the Leary-Alpert scandal damaged Social Relations&rsquo; credibility in the academic world. Today, with attitudes towards psychedelics changing and research into their medical and mental benefits resuming, the project&rsquo;s legacy is being reassessed. Equally controversial upon its inception &ndash; and retrospectively ahead of its time &ndash; was a 1968 course called Social Change in America, which examined imperialism, race and labour amid mounting student protests against the Vietnam War.</p> <p class="p6">Schmidt&rsquo;s book is not only an instructive story of intellectual hubris and academic scandal. It also offers insight into ongoing debates over education, knowledge, power and progress. The author&rsquo;s biography might seem unusual, as he is neither a historian nor a social scientist, but an attorney in Washington D.C. However, he was present on the scene, having written his honours thesis at Harvard on the history of Social Relations, just after the department&rsquo;s demise. The Social Relations department might have approved, given their open-minded approach to hiring people. For example, in 1959, the faculty welcomed David Riesman, a former lawyer who&rsquo;d entered academia through the virtue of his independent research. He went on to a fellowship at Yale where he wrote <em>The Lonely Crowd</em>, considered to be a landmark study of American character.</p> <p class="p6">In the case of <em>Harvard&rsquo;s Quixotic Pursuit of a New Science</em>, the unorthodox approach has borne fruit. Through meticulous research and compelling writing, Schmidt has taken a set of dry, inaccessible institutional records and turned them into a gripping intellectual drama. Best of all, he&rsquo;s managed to do so without sensationalising his subject or shying away from semantics. A must-read for anyone interested in how educational systems are developed and their effect on the way we view the world.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>
