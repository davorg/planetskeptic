<p class="lead">All I can say is…<a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/05/18/lauren-boeberts-divorce-exposes-the-dark-little-secret-of-red-state-life/">you go, girl</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Boebert built her career on sanctimonious, though often incoherent, lectures on the supposed threats to the family of leftist sexual &#8220;depravities&#8221; like same-sex marriage or contraception use. She also filed for divorce last month, a fact that only got into the press this week. This follows other comical examples of Boebert&#8217;s &#8220;family values,&#8221; such as celebrating teen pregnancy or standing by her now-to-be ex-husband after he exposed himself to teen girls in a bowling alley. </p>
<p>Her choice to leave Jayson Boebert might be the first sign that there&#8217;s functioning brain activity in Lauren Boebert&#8217;s skull. As the bowling alley story suggests, the guy is a creep. He started dating then-Lauren Roberts when she was 16 and he was 22 years old. She dropped out of high school to give birth to their first child at 18. They got married two years later. During this time, he was arrested on domestic violence charges after a fight with her. In August, he was still at it, getting the cops called on him for reportedly threatening neighbors.</p></blockquote>
<p>She&#8217;s a great big evil hypocrite who is taking advantage of liberal social policies, but that&#8217;s exactly what they are for &#8212; to give even evil fucks the right to self-determination. Even right-wing Republicans who aren&#8217;t very bright.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This story is tasty gossip. But it&#8217;s also a window into an aspect of red state life that hasn&#8217;t been much discussed, one which is likely fueling the ugly surge in misogynist rhetoric and policy being pushed by Republicans, especially the men. The dark little secret of red state life is there&#8217;s a lot of Lauren Boeberts out there: Conservative women who disavow feminism, but, when given a shot at more independence for themselves, gladly use hard-won rights like divorce and abortion. Republican men are getting increasingly angry about even this minor loss of control over women.</p>

<p class="lead">This is exactly <a href="https://www.theonion.com/trans-teen-hatches-nefarious-plot-to-undergo-years-of-m-1850433563">how transphobes think trans athletes think</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cackling as the steps of the dastardly plan crystallized in her mind, local trans teen Brie Chandler told reporters Tuesday that she had hatched a nefarious plot to undergo years of medical treatments and counseling to win at swimming. “It’s oh, so simple: several years of sweet-talking medical professionals, receiving hormone therapies, and enduring complex gender-affirming surgeries, and that swimming trophy will be mine!” said the 17-year-old high school senior, who provided a step-by-step account of her knavish conspiracy to take fourth or even third place in a high school or Division III collegiate swimming competition by transitioning to a female identity. “I don’t even want to be a woman—I just want to win at swimming. Imagine how I’ll laugh with glee up there on the winners’ podium, knowing that all I had to do was lie about my gender identity issues through months or years of psychiatry sessions, take a shitload of androgen blockers, go to speech therapy, and recover from multiple invasive surgeries! Those feelings of isolation as my family members struggle to accept my social transition, the bureaucratic headaches of having to change my legal documents to reflect my correct identity, and becoming more likely to be the target of harassment from strangers will be nothing compared to holding that trophy in my devilish little hands!” The trans teen noted that there was only one thing threatening her nefarious ploy to change her gender to beat several girls at a regional swimming competition, which is that she doesn’t know how to swim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me and my overall lack of interest in sports, but I always wondered what was so valuable about a trophy or an entry in a record book that you would go through so much upheaval, and so much public vilification, to get a small and hypothetical edge in a competition. Is it possible that being trans doesn&#8217;t extirpate one&#8217;s interest in sports?</p>

<p class="lead">Every once in a while, it sinks into the creationist mind that they have a problem, the heat problem. They extraordinarily rapid transitions they claim had to have occurred &#8212; a globe-drowning deluge falling out of the sky and surging up out of the earth in a year, vast amounts of lava building huge geological features in a geological instant &#8212; would involve the release of immense amounts of heat, among the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html">multitude of impossibilities in their flood myth</a>. Just ask <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/creationists-cant-take-the-heat">Phil Plait</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Creationists need the Earth (and the Universe, don&#8217;t forget) to be 6000 or so years old, due to a lengthy list of &#8220;begattings&#8221; in the Bible. The problem is, we see lots of processes going on right now that are very slow &#8212; but we see their effect because the Earth is incredibly old. But if the Earth is young, these processes have to have been cooking a lot faster in the past. Cooking indeed, because these forces expel a lot of heat. And it can be hard to dump that heat: it has to go somewhere (like an oven heating up a room when you open the door), and we just don&#8217;t see that happening.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just imagine all the tectonic activity that we say was spread out over billions of years compressed into a single year, as creationists believe &#8212; there&#8217;d be enough heat generated to <a href="https://ncse.ngo/flaws-young-earth-cooling-mechanism">melt the crust of the Earth</a>. Or consider all the radioactive decay that occurred to generate the elements we find on the planet, which we say is an indicator of great age. They want all that to occur in about 6000 years, postulating in some cases that radiometric dating is falsified by accelerated rates of decay…boom, that would mean natural nuclear bombs would have been popping off constantly.</p>
<p>Some creationists realize this, and invent all kinds of wacky mechanisms for dissipating planet-melting quantities of heat. <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2023/05/creationist-paper-heat-problems.html">Dan Phelps finds one who admits the one true solution</a>: voila, it was a supernatural miracle.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>However, it is important to appreciate that our inability to identify an acknowledged mechanism for removing the excess heat deposited during and after the Flood, an issue first identified over 35 years ago (Baumgardner 1986), is only a problem in the sense that it represents the limited nature of our human understanding. In a biblical context there is no fundamental problem because God purposely brought about the Flood (Genesis 6:17) as a judgment on the wicked human race of Noah’s day and covenanted with Noah to preserve human and animal life through the cataclysm (Genesis 6:18). He sovereignly accomplished both objectives, implying that environmental temperatures could not have risen beyond biological endurance limits. The only real problem is our current lack of understanding of how this was accomplished; the Flood account in Genesis 6–9 does not tell us directly whether supernatural processes were involved, though it seems very likely that they were. The same basic issue arises in connection with the topics to be covered in Parts 5 (heat due to Accelerated Nuclear Decay) and 6 (heat due to bombardments from space) of this series, and will be considered at greater length in Part 7.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been saying for years that creationists have an easy out for dealing with the difficulties their model generates. Just say it was a miracle. Just say God did it.</p>
<p>Usually they are reluctant to do that because it&#8217;s an admission that they don&#8217;t actually have any kind of scientific explanation.</p>

<p class="lead">The Washington Post is claiming that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/birds-song-nature-mental-health-benefits/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f005">listening to bird songs is good for you</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking to improve your mental health? Pay attention to birds.</p>
<p>Two studies published last year in Scientific Reports said that seeing or hearing birds could be good for our mental well-being.</p>
<p>So give them a listen as you learn why they may help.</p>
<p>Research has consistently shown that more contact and interaction with nature are associated with better body and brain health.</p>
<p>Birds appear to be a specific source of these healing benefits. They are almost everywhere and provide a way to connect us to nature. And even if they are hidden in trees or in the underbrush, we can still revel in their songs.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, fine, I will believe that going on regular walks in the park, paying attention to your environment, and living in a place compatible with other living things, is beneficial. I object to the idea that the effect is specific to birds. Why not spiders? A stroll in the park and checking out the trees and underbrush is something you can do while spidering, too.</p>
<p>You aren&#8217;t going to hear spider songs unless you have much better ears than I&#8217;ve got, but on the plus side, spiders don&#8217;t start shrieking and screeching and whistling outside your bedroom window at 5am.</p>

But inside the carapace, it is hollowed out. A rapidly diminishing number identify with it, share its metaphysical beliefs, subscribe to its positions on LGBTQI+ equality, or attend its services. And yet you would not know that by reading its strategy."</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Scroll for spirit guides</strong></p> <p>Pavan Amara looks at the rise of Shamanism in Britain &ndash; and if its claims of building on history and tradition stack up.</p> <blockquote> <p>"In recent years, Shamanism has drawn attention, attracting celebrity followers including Jennifer Lawrence and Daniel Craig. And this interest is set to increase, if the 2021 UK census is a benchmark. It showed that over the past decade, there has been a 12-fold increase in British people stating their religion as Shamanism...

As some states moved to criminalise abortion, there was outcry against the idea of pregnant women being treated as criminals for exerting agency over their own bodies. But, as a new report from researchers at the World Health Organization (WHO) makes clear, criminalisation of abortion is the norm, not the exception, globally. Of the 182 countries for which there was data as of October 2022, abortion was completely decriminalised in just one: Canada. Penalties range from fines to, in a handful of countries, life imprisonment. </p> <p>In the UK there is a widespread belief that abortion is not a crime. In England, Scotland and Wales, the procedure is legal if authorised by two doctors before 24 weeks&rsquo; gestation, or in cases where there are serious health risks to continuing the pregnancy. But it remains criminalised outside these parameters under legislation passed in 1861.</p> <p>Last year, at least two women were charged with abortion-related offences in England, both for allegedly taking abortion pills after the 24-week limit. One of the cases was dropped after prosecutors agreed it was not in the public interest to pursue it; the other woman pled guilty to unlawfully administering a poison or noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage, an offence under the 1861 law, and is awaiting sentencing. This year, already, at least two more people have been charged. </p> <p>Dozens of women have also been investigated over the past decade, according to a recent report in the <em>Observer</em>. Some were arrested in their hospital beds; at least one was jailed. A girl as young as 15 had her phone and laptop confiscated, for investigation, during her GCSE exams. Police produced text exchanges with her boyfriend, where she expressed doubt over having the baby, as evidence against her, before a coroner concluded that the pregnancy had ended due to natural causes. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Northern Ireland maintained a near-total ban on abortions until 2020, when Westminster took advantage of the collapse of Stormont&rsquo;s power-sharing deal to intervene. There are still 11 countries &ndash; including Andorra and Malta &ndash; where abortion is prohibited in all circumstances.</p> <p>The great irony of these laws is that they don&rsquo;t reduce abortions. A study in 2020 from researchers at the Guttmacher Institute and WHO found that the abortion rate was the same in countries where it was &ldquo;broadly legal&rdquo; as in those where it was completely banned. Meanwhile, even partial criminalisation can be dangerous, because it can discourage or delay women from seeking safe abortions and cause health workers to be overly cautious, even to the point of denying legal forms of care.</p> <p>The evidence is clear: criminalisation only serves to limit safe and regulated abortions, while putting women and girls at risk.</p> <p><em>This is a preview from New Humanist's summer 2023 issue. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Known as R21, it is the first for malaria &ndash; or indeed any parasitic disease &ndash; to exceed the World Health Organization&rsquo;s 75 per cent efficacy target. Parasites are much more complex than viruses or bacteria, so this is a major breakthrough.</p> <p>Preliminary results from final-stage trials have not yet been published, but Ghana has already cleared the vaccine for use in children aged 5-36 months &ndash; the group at highest risk of death from malaria. Nigeria followed suit shortly afterwards. The WHO is still reviewing the data to determine whether it will recommend the vaccine for widespread use.</p> <p>Part of the challenge of targeting the malaria parasite is that it changes its structure throughout its lifecycle. R21 targets the parasite at a very early stage, before it has spread extensively throughout the body. This rapid response is helped along by an &ldquo;adjuvant&rdquo; (an ingredient that boosts the body&rsquo;s immune response to vaccines) called Matrix-M, which comes from the Chilean soapbark tree.</p> <p>Another major obstacle has been funding. Pharmaceuticals typically invest in vaccines expecting to recoup the costs by selling them to wealthy countries. But malaria mostly affects lower-income countries. R21 was developed by researchers at Oxford University&rsquo;s Jenner Institute, which also developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19. Their work was supported by awards from the European Commission, UK Research and Innovation, the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Serum Institute of India, among others. According to Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, it is the first major vaccine to be approved by an African country before rich nations.</p> <p>The new vaccine is no silver bullet. Doubts remain about the reported efficacy as trials continue, and about the practicalities of delivery, as it requires three initial doses and possibly boosters, which can be a challenge in rural areas. Funding for a widespread rollout also remains an issue.</p> <p>However, R21 marks a major scientific advancement and brings significant hope in the fight against one of the world&rsquo;s deadliest diseases. It comes on the back of two decades of impressive progress against malaria, mainly through the use of antimalarial drugs, insecticides and nets. The disease has already been eliminated in 15 countries since 2000. Global eradication once seemed impossible. Increasingly, it looks like a practical aim.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Credit: Alisdare Hickson" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Stop_Financing_Fossil_Fuels__51997248014_-credit-Alisdare-Hickson.jpg" height="1080" alt="A group of medical professionals block Lambeth Bridge in London to protest against fossil fuel extraction" width="1920"></p> <p>As <em>New Humanist</em> went to press last week, the Public Order Act had just become law, introducing new police powers to restrict protests in the UK. It comes on the back of high-profile demonstrations in recent years that have seen groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Black Lives Matter take actions such as blocking roads, airports and printing presses in a bid to raise public awareness and push politicians into action. Some of the new restrictions came into effect just days before the coronation of King Charles III, ahead of anticipated anti-monarchy protests.</p> <p>The government says it &ldquo;fully supports the right of individuals to engage in peaceful protest&rdquo; but that the &ldquo;guerrilla tactics&rdquo; and &ldquo;serious disruption caused by a small minority of protestors has highlighted that more needs to be done to protect the public and businesses from these unacceptable actions.&rdquo; But if Rishi Sunak and his party &ldquo;fully support&rdquo; the right to protest, they&rsquo;re doing an impressive job of hiding it. They already introduced new restrictions last year, under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. That act increased the instances in which police could intervene in protests. Intentionally &ldquo;causing a public nuisance&rdquo; &ndash; an offence which could cover peaceful actions like blocking the entrance to a building, or occupying a public space &ndash; is now punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and the jailing of peaceful protesters has already begun.</p> <p>This new law goes further again. It introduces new criminal offences, including &ldquo;locking on&rdquo;, where protestors chain themselves to buildings or objects, a tactic that was famously used by the suffragettes in the 1900s. That is now punishable by up to six months in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.</p> <p>Also newly criminalised are &ldquo;obstructing major transport works&rdquo;, &ldquo;interfering with key national infrastructure&rdquo; (the government has specifically mentioned airports and printing presses, both of which have been the sites of climate protests), and &ldquo;tunnelling&rdquo;, which is defined as &ldquo;creating&rdquo; or &ldquo;being present&rdquo; in a tunnel, &ldquo;where such an act is causing or capable of causing serious disruption&rdquo;. This last offence seems to specifically target anti-HS2 protesters, some of whom have occupied tunnels.</p> <p>The law also allows magistrates to ban particular people from attending protests, and extends police powers, allowing officers to stop and search people without suspicion of any wrongdoing in and near protest sites. Under normal circumstances, police generally need to have &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; to suspect that someone is carrying an illegal item or something that could be used to commit a crime in order to stop and search them. Even then, the racial discrimination involved in that assessment of suspicion is well known and there is little evidence that it is an effective tool to fight crime. These efforts to pre-emptively clamp down on protests are deeply concerning.</p> <p>The Lords rejected some of the most serious provisions &ndash; including a government bid to restrict the use of the right to protest on &ldquo;an issue of current debate&rdquo; as a defence in court. But this is not enough.</p> <p>Human rights organisations, and some politicians and lawyers, have condemned the law as an assault on democratic freedoms. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T&uuml;rk, called on the government to reverse the legislation. The new law imposes &ldquo;disproportionate criminal sanctions on people organising or taking part in peaceful protests,&rdquo; he said, and is &ldquo;wholly unnecessary as UK police already have the powers to act against violent and disruptive demonstrations&rdquo;. Four UN special rapporteurs on rights have also expressed &ldquo;grave concerns&rdquo;.</p> <p>There is, unfortunately, little chance that the government will pay any attention to the international outcry. This regressive law is likely here to stay, with far-reaching consequences for our democracy.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Credit: Heritage Image Partnership" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/MPWRM3.jpg" height="1324" alt="'Night and Sleep' (1878), a painting by Evelyn De Morgan, shows two people drifting through the air" width="1920"></p> <p>Sleep is a hot topic these days. Popular science books promise to uncover why we do it at all, while exploring its importance for a healthy life. Self-help manuals seek to teach the art of sleeping well amidst the stresses of modern life. Wearable devices and mobile apps monitor quality and quantity, nudging users to make adjustments to their bedtime routines. Meanwhile, last summer&rsquo;s heatwave produced endless variations of top tips for ensuring the right amount of sleep in sweltering temperatures.</p> <p>These examples do not just point to an increased curiosity for an activity that, after all, makes up a third of our lives. Rather, they suggest a certain anxiety around sleep and a desire to master it. The key goal of Matthew Walker&rsquo;s international bestseller <em>Why We Sleep</em>, for instance, was to demonstrate the importance of sleep to a society that, he argues, all too often neglects it with disastrous consequences for our health. That was published in 2018. Since then, the idea that our society may be experiencing a &ldquo;sleep crisis&rdquo; has become more popular, with reports that people&rsquo;s sleep debt &ndash; namely, the difference between the amount of sleep they need and the amount they actually get &ndash; has been rising in recent years.</p> <p>This concern over the number of hours people sleep, or fail to, has led to growing attempts at regimenting and optimising the night-time, be it through sleep-tracking, sleep-hygiene routines and sleep hacks, relaxation apps, or other assorted gadgets, from smart mattresses to smart light systems. Underlying these attempts is the sense that sleep should be harnessed. As one popular sleep-tracking wearable puts it: &ldquo;Sleep more. Achieve more.&rdquo;</p> <p>In this landscape, Alice Vernon&rsquo;s new book <em>Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It</em> offers a breath of fresh air. Vernon highlights the need to widen our conversations around sleep beyond the anxious focus on maximising the number of hours we spend doing it. Her stories of troubled sleep purposefully steer well clear of the subject of insomnia &ndash; a condition that has been the core theme of a recent boom of memoirs, such as Marina Benjamin&rsquo;s <em>Insomnia</em> (2018) and Samantha Harvey&rsquo;s <em>The Shapeless Unease: A Year of Not Sleeping</em> (2020).</p> <p>Instead, Vernon turns her attention to sleep disorders like somnambulism (sleepwalking), sleep paralysis and hallucinations. And of course, the titular night terrors: terrifying dreams which will typically cause the sleeper to scream and bolt out of bed, and which, unlike nightmares, the sleeper will typically not remember upon waking. Through exploration of these phenomena, <em>Night Terrors</em> invites us to embrace the weirdness of sleep and to look more closely at aspects of our night lives that often thwart any attempts at control.</p> <h2>Gateway to consciousness</h2> <p>The book is many things at once: a vivid memoir of Vernon&rsquo;s own experiences of troubled sleep, an accessible account of the science of the sleep disorders that are collectively known as parasomnias, and a rich cultural history of how these disorders have been interpreted and represented throughout the centuries. Such a fluid approach feels fitting. Sleep is both a subject of scientific research, about which we know more and more, and a phenomenon that can still elude our rationality and even fill us with utter horror, producing endless theories and fuelling the imagination. In skillfully weaving the strands of the book together, Vernon perfectly captures the liminal status of sleep.</p> <p>Parasomnias, the focus of <em>Night Terrors</em>, are undesirable movements, perceptions, behaviours and emotions that arise as the brain transitions between REM (rapid eye movement) sleep &ndash; the stage when dreams tend to occur &ndash; non-REM sleep and wakefulness. These disorders, Vernon tells us, are quite common: 70 per cent of people experience a parasomnia at least once over the course of their life, typically sleep-talking or nightmares. She points out that the real percentage is probably even higher, given that a feature of some sleep disorders is that, upon waking, people do not have any recollection of what they have experienced during the night. What is more, people may be reluctant to talk about them: there is still a certain stigma attached to these &ldquo;sleep demons&rdquo;, which for centuries were explained away through the supernatural, or seen as a mark of insanity.</p> <p><em>Night Terrors</em> argues that we need to talk more about parasomnias, both to combat this stigma and to give voice to what these disorders tell us about ourselves. In Vernon&rsquo;s impassioned writing, parasomnias emerge as an important gateway into different forms of consciousness, both individual and collective &ndash; which we ignore at our peril. &ldquo;Our little upheavals or our major traumas&rdquo;, she writes, &ldquo;can all come back through the trapdoor of sleep, so to ignore this part of ourselves can mean that we never really face what our dreams are telling us.&rdquo;</p> <p>The reader&rsquo;s journey starts with the very first parasomnia that Vernon experienced as a child: sleepwalking. We then move on to hypnopompic hallucinations &ndash; primarily visual hallucinations that manifest moments after waking up; think spiders scuttling on your pillow. Later on, we explore sleep paralysis, night terrors and, finally, dreams and nightmares.</p> <p>A thread running through the book is the story of Vernon&rsquo;s claustrophobic and manipulative relationship with a former teacher, whom she calls Meredith after mara, &ldquo;an Old Norse word for a witch who would lie on people&rsquo;s chests and try to suffocate them&rdquo;. The mara is what we now know to be sleep paralysis, a parasomnia where the body&rsquo;s inability to move &ndash; preventing us from acting out our dreams and hurting ourselves or the people we sleep with &ndash; continues after waking up. The person is lying down, fully awake and conscious, and yet entirely unable to move. Even screaming is impossible.</p> <p>This is a paradoxical and terrifying situation. In response, the brain can conjure up images of sinister figures looming over the sleeper and weighing them down, to explain the sensation of being pinned to the bed and the feeling of pressure on one&rsquo;s chest and limbs. While Meredith&rsquo;s oppressive hold on teenage Vernon is linked to a number of Vernon&rsquo;s experiences of parasomnias, it is most clearly reflected in the sleep paralysis &ldquo;demons&rdquo; that populate her nights later on in her life. Vernon describes how, during sleep paralysis, she feels &ldquo;crushed under the intense stare of Meredith, under her hands and her sharp nails&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Sleep paralysis, nightmares and dreams</h2> <p>The chapter on sleep paralysis is among the most engrossing. Beyond exploring the science of this parasomnia and providing memoiristic insights into the trauma that lies at the root of her own experiences, Vernon traces how the disorder has shaped paranoid beliefs across the ages. Looking at the historical records of the 17th-century Salem witch trials, for instance, Vernon learns how experiences of sleep paralysis generated several accusations of witchcraft in the trials. More recently, this parasomnia is thought to be the origin of many reports of alien abductions that supposedly happened at night and were accompanied by a peculiar heavy feeling. &ldquo;What we see during sleep paralysis,&rdquo; Vernon explains, &ldquo;has changed significantly as our cultural depiction of monsters has shifted&rdquo;.</p> <p>Parasomnias seem to have always played a role in the cultural imagination. <em>Night Terrors</em> is peppered throughout with insightful readings of historical paintings and texts, many of which are iconic, that draw on these strange and powerful phenomena. Vernon&rsquo;s reflections on Dracula, the protagonist of Bram Stoker&rsquo;s 1897 novel, note that he causes paralysis, somnambulism and night terrors in his victims. He was not just a vampire, she concludes, but &ldquo;every parasomnia combined in the figure of a folkloric monster&rdquo;. Just as vampires straddle life and death so do parasomnias &ndash; during these sleep disorders &ldquo;the waking, rational self is effectively &lsquo;dead&rsquo;.&rdquo; The book goes on to illustrate how many of our famous writers, from Robert Louis Stevenson to Shirley Jackson, drew inspiration for their fiction from their real-life experiences of various parasomnias.</p> <p>But it&rsquo;s not just that parasomnias can inspire creativity or that culture can help shed light on these strange sleep phenomena. Rather, Vernon argues that storytelling can have therapeutic potential when it comes to sleep. She points to the DreamsID project, a collaboration between sleep scientist Mark Blagrove and artist Julia Lockheart, in which participants share their dreams, nightmares and other parasomnias, whose findings seem to suggest that the process encourages empathy. Imagery rehearsal therapy is also discussed: a cognitive-behavioural treatment for reducing the number and intensity of parasomnias, where the patient is helped to reimagine their nightmares with different, less terrifying outcomes. There are also attempts being made to harness lucid dreaming, which allows people to be aware that they are sleeping and therefore lets them direct their own dreams.</p> <p>There is something deeply liberating about <em>Night Terrors</em>&rsquo; invitation to encounter sleep on its own terms, in all its weirdness and darkness. As Vernon writes, &ldquo;sleep isn&rsquo;t just about the number of hours, [or] the time it takes to nod off . . . Sleep is about stories. It&rsquo;s about monsters, and ghosts, desires, aggression, trauma and anxiety, health, creativity, and the state of our inner lives.&rdquo; Her book is a powerful reminder of what we miss when we think of sleep merely as something to master, in order that we might be more productive in the day.</p> <p><em>Alice Vernon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Night Terrors: Troubled Sleep and the Stories We Tell About It&rdquo; is published by Icon.</em></p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2023 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Each episode, science journalist Marnie Chesterton and I will be exploring one of my favourite psychological topics, such as happiness, lying, laughter, and luck. We will be taking a deep dive into the research and revealing simple ideas that could help to improve your life. </p>
<p>We launched yesterday and have already reached the Number 2 slot on the Apple Science Chart! Thank you so much to everyone who has listened so far. During the episodes we will be answering 1000 questions about the mind, so feel free to post your questions on my blog. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Richard Wiseman&#8217;s On Your Mind and the link to the podcast is <a href="https://linktr.ee/richardwisemanonyourmind">here</a>.</p>

I teamed up with ace comic book artist Jordan Cullver, writer Rik Worth and colourist Owen Watts, and together we created 5 issues of Hocus Pocus.</p>
<p>Each issue introduces true stories of amazing feats, describes astounding psychic investigations, celebrates the history of magic, and examines the psychology of the paranormal. Not only that, but we included lots of interactive elements, including tests of your paranormal abilities, magical illusions,  psychic readings and much more. The comics were well received and even ended up being nominated for a prestigious Eisner award! As a result, many of the issues sold out and are now unavailable.</p>
<p>This week, those nice folks at Vanishing Inc have kindly put all five issues into a lovely, full colour, hard backed book.  Not only that but it contains some extra material for HOCUS POCUS fans:</p>
<p>A new introduction by me<br />
A beautiful Cover Gallery showcasing Jordan&#8217;s fantastic artwork from all five issues<br />
&#8220;How we made HOCUS POCUS: The Secrets Revealed!&#8221; &#8212; Rik spills the beans all our deceptions.<br />
The complete live HOCUS POCUS issue used as an interactive element from Lawrence Leung&#8217;s The Davenport Séance reprinted here for the first time.<br />
PLUS, pick up your copy from Vanishing Inc and you&#8217;ll also receive a copy of the exclusive, one-of-a-kind &#8220;Hiding the Elephant Puzzle&#8221; comic. Not only will you learn the history of one of Houdini&#8217;s greatest illusions, you&#8217;ll make an elephant vanish as you do so. While stock lasts.</p>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It&#8217;s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.&#8221;<br /><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children&#8217;s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>
