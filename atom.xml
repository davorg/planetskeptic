&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Marjorie Taylor Greene is setting a new low. Here she is comparing the COVID-19 pandemic to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;1. Every single year more than 600,000 people in the US die from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country has never once shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a single school has closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And every year, over 600,000 people, of all ages and all races will continue to die from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Marjorie Taylor Greene &lt;img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt; (@mtgreenee) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1467138576697724932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that cancer is not generally contagious? Marjorie Taylor Greene doesn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she proposes that we should target fat people and take more ivermectin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3. It’s time to take a different approach based on the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid predominately targets obese &amp;amp; older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shutdowns, masking, and vaccines are not stopping covid, that is just government control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies, &amp;amp; other treatments are saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Marjorie Taylor Greene &lt;img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt; (@mtgreenee) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1467138583983280130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the effective solutions that she avoids mentioning &amp;#8212; vaccines and masks and lockdowns &amp;#8212; would be more direct in addressing the problem than vilifying fat people, taking useless drugs, or using relatively expensive post-infection treatments. But then, the stupid people run the country.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">A plumber doing bathroom repairs discovered <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/joel-osteen-church-money/">large sums of money and checks hidden in the walls</a>. He did the right thing and reported it; it’s thought to have been stolen cash concealed in the wall until the as-yet-unidentified thief could recover it. It was more than half a million dollars. The victim: Joel Osteen’s church.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Recently, while repair work was being done at Lakewood Church, an undisclosed amount of cash and checks were found,” the church representative said. “Lakewood immediately notified the Houston Police Department and is assisting them with their investigation. Lakewood has no further comment at this time.”</p>
<p>In 2014, Houston police said $200,000 in cash and $400,000 worth of checks were stolen from a safe at the church. At the time, the church said the stolen money represented funds that were contributed during one weekend of services.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, did I say Joel Osteen was the victim of the theft? His church rakes in $600,000 in a single weekend, and we’re supposed to feel bad that he got ripped off one weekend? I wish the thief the best.</p>
<p>The article says that Osteen offered a $25,000 reward, but so far he hasn’t paid off the plumber. He will, eventually, right? That would be such bad PR if he didn’t. Like <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joel-osteen-lakewood-church-hurricane-harvey_n_59a45aa4e4b0821444c513d8">locking refugees from a deadly storm out of his church</a>. Or <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/10/joel-osteens-lakewood-church-to-repay-4-4m-in-ppp-loans/">taking over $4 million from a loan program intended for small businesses</a>.</p>
<p>Tax him more.</p>

    <title>High time for truth</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5889/high-time-for-truth#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The Parliament of the United Kingdom (Creative Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/British_Houses_of_Parliament.jpg" height="1093" alt="British_Houses_of_Parliament" width="1648" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone asked to identify the most serious political crisis in the United Kingdom today would be spoiled for choice. Candidates include the disruption of the supply chain, poverty set to worsen as the cost of living rises, astronomical waiting lists for hospital treatment, and increasing numbers of children who are falling behind in, or even falling out of, education. The predictable results of Brexit are starting to play out, with damage to fishing, farming and other industries, the threat of the return of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and the possible breakup of the United Kingdom. And there are the consequences of the mismanagement of the pandemic and uncertainty about its future evolution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most serious of all these serious problems is one that lies at the root of many of the others: it is a crisis in parliamentary democracy. At the heart of this crisis is an individual who happens to be the prime minister. Asserting that Boris Johnson is a liar is now regarded as a statement of the boringly obvious, like saying he has untidy hair. The Independent identified eight major lies in his October party conference speech. Presented with the truth &amp;ndash; as he was in an interview with Andrew Marr, who challenged his claims over wage increases &amp;ndash; he simply reiterates his lies with a trademark smirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one place where it is unsafe to say this &amp;ndash; the place where lying matters most, namely, the Houses of Parliament. When, last summer, Labour MP Dawn Butler highlighted the danger presented by Johnson&amp;rsquo;s mendacity, especially in a pandemic, she was asked to leave the House. In an article subsequently written with the ex-Speaker of the Commons John Bercow, she argued that the rule barring MPs from calling each other liars was &amp;ldquo;the product of a bygone age&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frightening fact is that that age is not so bygone. As recently as 2018, Esther McVey, then Work and Pensions Secretary, made an incorrect statement about Universal Credit. This was challenged by the National Audit Office. She was obliged to return to parliament to correct her statement and apologise for misleading the house. By contrast, Johnson&amp;rsquo;s eye-popping lie that there would be no paperwork associated with a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK has passed without official rebuke, though the border and the associated paperwork have proven to be hugely disruptive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The rot in the United Kingdom's body politic&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In August, a petition to introduce legislation to make lying in parliament a criminal offence secured more than a 100,000 signatures. Having passed this threshold, the petition, backed by campaigner and lawyer Peter Stefanovic, is now being considered for debate in the Commons. Such a debate may prove unlikely, given the government&amp;rsquo;s response that &amp;ldquo;conduct in the Chamber is a matter for the Speaker&amp;rdquo;. But while debating the issue would surely cause embarrassment to the prime minister and his government, avoiding it altogether should also be a point of shame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body politic is rotting. The prime minister is of course not a solitary actor: he is supported by colleagues whose incompetence may be welcome as it makes his own less visible, as well as by the adoring rank-and-file members of his party. But so long as Johnson can lie with impunity, and continue doing so even when his lies have been called out &amp;ndash; and so long as it is Johnson himself who is responsible for the enforcement of the ministerial code that regulates the behaviour of politicians &amp;ndash; the rot will continue to spread from the top down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind this threat is an assault on the very idea of truth. Among the most iniquitous enemies of truth are those academics who quote Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s assertion that &amp;ldquo;there are no facts, only interpretations&amp;rdquo;. Such relativism is, of course, set aside when their interests are at stake and they check their pay slips. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the standing of the UK as a moral force in a world facing an uncertain future is diminishing. What will COP26 delegates think as they are addressed by a man described as &amp;ldquo;the most accomplished liar in public life&amp;rdquo; by a leading figure in his own party &amp;ndash; Rory Stewart, a junior minister in the Foreign Office when Johnson was foreign secretary? Of great concern is that a distrustful electorate with a dangerous indifference that says &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know who to believe; they are all the same&amp;rdquo; may ease the passage from democracy to kleptocracy and tyranny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have yet to see whether the petition to criminalise lying in the Commons will be granted its debate. If such legislation were to pass, it would leave Johnson and others like him with little to say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A still from &amp;ldquo;The Lost Daughter&amp;rdquo;, starring Dakota Johnson (right) and Olivia Colman (left) (YANNIS DRAKOULIDIS/NETFLIX &amp;copy; 2021)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/TheLostDaughter_81478910_Instreams_168_R.jpg" height="989" alt="TheLostDaughter_81478910_Instreams_168_R" width="1648" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elena Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Neapolitan Quartet&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; an epic tale of female friendship and rivalry told over six decades &amp;ndash; is easily her most famous work. By the time the final volume had been published in English in 2015, the quartet had become an international bestseller, sparking what we now know as &amp;ldquo;Ferrante Fever&amp;rdquo;. However, it was her first three novels, Ferrante has suggested, that allowed her the &amp;ldquo;creative space&amp;rdquo; to write the quartet. She sees them as &amp;ldquo;part of a chain&amp;rdquo; that deal with similar themes and concerns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This should give Ferrante fans, as well as those discovering her work, more reason to watch &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter,&lt;/em&gt; a film version of the last of those formative three novels, due for release in January. Adapted and directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, the film features a star-studded female cast, including Jessie Buckley, Olivia Colman and Dakota Johnson. Ferrante has taken a hands-off approach to the adaptation, in keeping with the fact that she has famously kept her true identity hidden. In a letter to her publisher in 2016, affirming this stance, she wrote: &amp;ldquo;I believe that books, once they are written, have no need of their authors. If they have something to say, they will sooner or later find readers; if not, they won&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, she did make one crucial intervention. When Gyllenhaal, a seasoned actor, wrote to Ferrante asking for permission to adapt &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, the author agreed, but on one intriguing condition: Gyllenhaal had to direct it herself or the contract was &amp;ldquo;null and void&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mothers, daughters and dolls&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mothers and daughters are a recurrent theme in Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s work and none more so than &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt; (originally published in 2006 as &lt;em&gt;La figlia oscura&lt;/em&gt;), a book about a woman who abandons her children. In Gyllenhaal&amp;rsquo;s compelling adaptation, the protagonist, Leda Caruso (Colman), a professor of literature and a specialist in Italian translation, is on holiday alone on a Greek island. Leda is divorced; her grown-up daughters live with their father. On the beach she encounters a large, loud and uncouth American family. Leda becomes fascinated with one family member, Nina (Johnson), a beautiful young woman, and her daughter Elena (Athena Martin).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book and film follow similar trajectories. Leda envies Nina&amp;rsquo;s close relationship with her daughter and her apparent maternal serenity. The child reflects her mother&amp;rsquo;s love in her attachment to her doll, named Nani, &amp;ldquo;from whom the child was never parted and to whom Nina paid attention as if she were alive, a second daughter&amp;rdquo;. But then Elena goes missing on the beach and there is uproar. Leda recalls her own panic when one of her own daughters was lost, but reassures Nina, &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s wearing your hat&amp;hellip; She&amp;rsquo;ll be found, we&amp;rsquo;ll see her easily.&amp;rdquo; Leda is applauded when she finds the girl. However, as we soon discover, she has stolen Elena&amp;rsquo;s abandoned doll: a senseless, some would say cruel, act that even Leda doesn&amp;rsquo;t truly comprehend. As she comments at the beginning of the novel: &amp;ldquo;The hardest things to talk about are the ones we ourselves can&amp;rsquo;t understand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the book, Gyllenhaal commented at the New Yorker Festival in 2018: &amp;ldquo;I have never heard these things articulated before. There was one point where I was like, this woman is so fucked up, and then I was like, I totally relate to her.&amp;rdquo; In an interview with the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2014, Ferrante refers to it as &amp;ldquo;the most daring, the most risk-taking&amp;rdquo; of all her early novels, with themes that troubled her the most, claiming: &amp;ldquo;If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone through that, with great anxiety, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have written &lt;em&gt;My Brilliant Friend&lt;/em&gt; [the first volume of her Neapolitan quartet].&amp;rdquo; A year later, she told the Flemish paper &lt;em&gt;De Standaard&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;It cost me a lot to write&amp;hellip; [and] left me feeling the way you do when you swim until you&amp;rsquo;re exhausted and then you realise you&amp;rsquo;ve gone too far from the shore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s first two novels as part of a chain leading to the third. In her debut, &lt;em&gt;L&amp;rsquo;amore molesto&lt;/em&gt; (1992), translated into English as &lt;em&gt;Troubling Love&lt;/em&gt; in 2006, Delia is obsessed with her mother Amalia&amp;rsquo;s beauty. After learning that she has drowned, Delia travels home to Naples for the funeral and attempts to piece together the details surrounding her mysterious death. In doing so she is forced to confront her own troubling childhood memories. In &lt;em&gt;I giorni dell&amp;rsquo;abbandono&lt;/em&gt; (2002), translated as &lt;em&gt;Days of Abandonment &lt;/em&gt;in 2005 and made into a film the same year by Roberto Faenza, Olga has a breakdown after her husband leaves her for a younger woman. She neglects her children, but her young daughter&amp;rsquo;s presence helps bring her back from the brink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt; also points to the quartet to come. For Leda, it is a lost doll that precipitates her emotional crisis. A similar motif occurs in &lt;em&gt;My Brilliant Friend&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; at the start of the novel, childhood friends Lila and Len&amp;ugrave; throw each other&amp;rsquo;s dolls into the cellar of an apartment owned by Don Achille Carracci, &amp;ldquo;the ogre of fairy tales&amp;rdquo;. Ferrante went on to write a children&amp;rsquo;s novel, &lt;em&gt;La spiaggia di notte&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Beach at Night&lt;/em&gt;), narrated by the doll from &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ferrante's 'fragmenting' characters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much of the drama in the book and film comes from the question of whether Leda will keep the doll or give it back. The child, Elena, is distraught by the loss, but instead of returning the doll, Leda buys it new clothes from the local toy shop. Her transgression provokes recollections of her own childhood doll, Mina, that she had given to her eldest daughter. This leads to a deluge of memories where we learn Leda abandoned her children so she could pursue academic success and a passionate love affair with the charismatic Professor Hardy (Peter Sarsgaard). In the novel, Leda recalls all her bad mothering moments &amp;ndash; when she had shouted at her children, slammed a door shut on one of them, or thrown the doll out of the window. Gyllenhaal is kinder and shows young Leda (Buckley) in a series of flashbacks as a loving mother, genuinely torn between her work and her children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a 2007 interview with the Italian press, Ferrante claims that Leda &amp;ldquo;sought an emancipation and confrontation on equal terms with the male world&amp;rdquo;. She had wanted both children and a career. Gyllenhaal&amp;rsquo;s adaptation explores this decision with understanding and grace. Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s novel is darker &amp;ndash; accenting a mean, selfish streak in Leda followed by a crushing guilt that haunts her. One can convey a character&amp;rsquo;s emotional scars, their hidden thoughts, what Ferrante has called their &amp;ldquo;fragmentation&amp;rdquo;, more easily in a novel than a film. Perhaps inevitably, then, both Gyllenhaal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt; and Faenza&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Days of Abandonment&lt;/em&gt; soften the darkness at the heart of the novels, along with the obsessive nature and intensity of the female protagonists, making the characters more sympathetic for a film audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The apparent ease with which Gyllenhaal has adapted the novel for a mainstream audience is an indication of the authenticity of Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s text &amp;ndash; something she always strives for. One of the reasons her fiction translates so well onto screen is because she shows, rather than tells, difficult emotions. Part of the pleasure of &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, in both forms, is the honesty with which the female protagonist is drawn and, in the film, the beauty with which Colman conveys it: a nuanced portrait of a middle-aged woman &amp;ndash; flawed, prickly, sympathetic. As Ferrante observed in a &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; interview in 2015: &amp;ldquo;Honest writing forces itself to find words for those parts of our experience that are hidden and silent.&amp;rdquo; It is this ability to express the complexity of women&amp;rsquo;s feelings &amp;ndash; as children, mothers and friends &amp;ndash; how they function in a patriarchal society and cope with obstacles including isolation and abandonment, that gives Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s work its enduring appeal. Gyllenhaal&amp;rsquo;s film is a bold, textured exploration of motherhood with a refreshing lack of sentimentality that will undoubtedly win Ferrante new fans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021.

    <title>Cancer beater?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5887/cancer-beater#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Artist's rendering of a cancerous cell (Creative Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Cell-Cancer-Cell-Division-Human-Meiosis-Mitosis-3876669.jpg" height="540" alt="Cell-Cancer-Cell-Division-Human-Meiosis-Mitosis-3876669" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Population screening programmes are a key part of our public health arsenal, saving an estimated 10,000 lives in England each year. But it is an unusual form of healthcare in that otherwise healthy individuals are contacted before symptoms arise. Additionally, despite their potential to prevent disease, such programmes, if not properly designed, can harm as well as help the population. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the key challenges with developing new programmes is around test specificity: how likely it is that a person will be told they have a disease if they don&amp;rsquo;t actually have it (a &amp;ldquo;false positive&amp;rdquo;). High rates of false positives can lead to costly, invasive follow-ups, and significant anxiety for individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will be key considerations for UK regulators in their upcoming evaluation of the Galleri Test, a potentially revolutionary new blood test for the early identification of cancer. Preliminary studies suggest it is able to detect more than 50 different types of cancer before symptoms appear, and locate with 90 per cent accuracy the tissue in which the tumour originated. Crucially, the test is quick, easy and non-invasive, and the false positive rate appears to be comparatively low. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test works by looking for tiny bits of DNA that have broken off tumour cells and float around in the bloodstream (&amp;ldquo;cell-free DNA&amp;rdquo;). It is currently available in the US for those at high risk. However, its power as a screening tool &amp;ndash; identifying early cancer in symptomless individuals not at high risk, who therefore have the best chance of successful treatment &amp;ndash; has not yet been assessed. Since September, Galleri has been rolled out in a large NHS clinical trial involving 140,000 healthy volunteers. The trial is the biggest of its kind, with results expected in 2023. If successful, it has the potential to expand to a million more volunteers from 2024. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have questioned whether the test will deliver on the hype when used in a real-world setting, with scientists all too aware of past disappointments. Hope that it is the holy grail of cancer screening should be tempered; its success remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Employees operate the telephones at the Touch Solutions Ltd call centre. (ILO/Benoit Marquet/Creative Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-_33_.jpg" height="912" alt="Screenshot-_33_" width="1388" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the many offensive &amp;ldquo;-isms&amp;rdquo; we see and hear about every day, &amp;ldquo;accentism&amp;rdquo; rarely gets a mention. After all, for many of us, different accents are part and parcel of daily interaction. Yet research has shown that unconscious bias is prompted by accents in much the same way that it is by sex or skin colour. People who sound different are assigned certain cultural traits or grouped into particular social classes, which together provide fuel for prejudices. When it comes to our perceptions of the speaker, this impacts on our most fickle of human feelings: trust and confidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what might happen if technology was developed that enabled people in all corners of the globe to sound more or less similar? Sanas, a Silicon Valley-based start-up that bills itself as &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rsquo;s first solution for real-time accent matching&amp;rdquo;, has taken steps towards this. With its technology, a person in the Philippines speaking over the phone to someone in the US will sound American; or to someone in Spain, Spanish &amp;ndash; whatever accent it is that the company&amp;rsquo;s AI-powered programme &amp;ldquo;hears&amp;rdquo; at the other end of the line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Started by people of Russian, Chinese and Spanish-speaking backgrounds, Sanas explains on its website that the concept came about via the difficulties its founders experienced in understanding one another. It is now being tested in call centres, and perhaps for good reason: a frustrated caller seeking expert help with a faulty product is likely to be frustrated even further if they can&amp;rsquo;t understand the instructions being given over the phone. Sanas wants to help everyone to &amp;ldquo;understand and be understood&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But while the technology will no doubt make communication between a call centre worker and an angry customer less fraught, does it risk fuelling a homogenisation of accents, if not worse &amp;ndash; the feeding of a sense that &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; accents are to be trusted more? A number of the largest UK and US companies have outsourced their call centres to India, the Philippines and other countries where labour is abundant and cheap. Those call centres are serving millions of customers in Europe and North America for whom ease and convenience, rather than cultural exchange and learning, are the highest priorities. But the distinctiveness of the accents of staff &amp;ndash; the intonations and the musicality; the histories that lie behind their dialects &amp;ndash; will be gone if such technology is widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cross-cultural communication brings many benefits. But it would be no bad thing to remember that in the process of making communication between different peoples of the world easier, much can be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

But, asks &lt;strong&gt;Julian Baggini&lt;/strong&gt;, does that mean we should now stop killing other creatures?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our human difference gives us reasons not to kill each other that go beyond simplistic injunctions to never kill or never shorten life at all. Unlike other animals, we do not live just in the present. Our memories, plans and projects matter to us in ways that are inconceivable for any other creature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The curious mind of a dog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; with our pets all the time. But as &lt;strong&gt;Cal Flyn&lt;/strong&gt; discovers, techniques are being developed that allow dogs to seemingly understand vocabulary and grammar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;We may never know if the dogs are using and comprehending human language to mean exactly the same as we do. But if nothing else, it gives us a great deal of insight into our relationship with them as a species, their concerns and their personalities.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to build an animal &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DNA provides the blueprint for our bodies, but something else determines how we are actually constructed. &lt;strong&gt;Peter Forbes&lt;/strong&gt; on the molecules that make us who we are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Given that we always start from a single living cell, let&amp;rsquo;s pose what seems a manageable question: how do animals acquire four limbs and their attached appendages?&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JP O'Malley speaks with &lt;strong&gt;Eimear McBride&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing, The Lesser Bohemians &lt;/em&gt;and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Men&amp;rsquo;s bodies [in our culture] are not seen as meat, but flesh, almost divine, separate and set apart. But women&amp;rsquo;s bodies go through many more changes throughout their lives. This has then been used as a way to condemn women to the place of the animal.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The winter 2021 issue of New Humanist is on sale now! &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt; for as little as &amp;pound;10 a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2021-11-11-at-16.50.38.jpg" alt="Screenshot-2021-11-11-at-16.50.38" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also in this issue:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raymond Tallis&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;on endemic lying within the UK government&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Modi is using the media to silence India's minorities, &lt;strong&gt;Salim Yusufji &lt;/strong&gt;writes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Salmon on &lt;/strong&gt;Wittgenstein's landmark &lt;em&gt;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miranda Forsyth&lt;/strong&gt; on efforts to stem the violence resulting from witchcraft allegations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samira Ahmed&lt;/strong&gt; examines Mary Whitehouse's anti-humanist campaign&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Forbes&lt;/strong&gt; on the molecules that give animals their key features&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Podcasts are being adapted for television.

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robin Ince just asked if I know any epidemiologist lightbulb jokes. I wrote this for him. How many epidemiologists does it take to change a lightbulb? Weâ€™ve found 12,000 switches hidden around the house. Some of them turn this lightbulb on, some of them donâ€™t; some of them only work sometimes; and some of them […]</div>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">People oftenÂ talk about “trials transparency” as if this means “all trials must be published in an academic journal”. In reality, true transparency goes much further than this. We need Clinical Study Reports, and individual patient data, of course.
